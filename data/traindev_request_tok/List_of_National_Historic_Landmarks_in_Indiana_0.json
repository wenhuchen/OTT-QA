  "/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Richardville": "Jean Baptiste de Richardville ( c. 1761 - 13 August 1841 ) , also known as Pin\u0161iwa or Peshewa in the Miami-Illinois language ( meaning Wildcat or Lynx ) or John Richardville in English , was the last akima ( civil chief ) of the Miami people . He began his career in the 1790s as a fur trader who controlled an important portage connecting the Maumee River to the Little River ( the present-day Little Wabash River ) in what became the present-day state of Indiana . Richardville emerged a principal chief in 1816 and remained a leader of the Miamis until his death in 1841 . He was a signatory to the Treaty of Greenville ( 1795 ) , as well as several later treaties between the U.S. government and the Miami people , most notably the Treaty of Fort Wayne ( 1803 ) , the Treaty of Fort Wayne ( 1809 ) , the Treaty of Saint Mary 's ( 1818 ) , the Treaty of Mississinewas ( 1826 ) , the treaty signed at the Forks of the Wabash ( 1838 ) , and the Treaty of the Wabash ( 1840 ) . Richardville and other Miami leaders were criticized for personally benefitting from their roles as tribal chiefs and treaty negotiators . However , their efforts successfully delayed for decades the removal of the Miami people to federal lands west of the Mississippi River and gained additional time to negotiate concessions and obtain the best prices available for Miami lands . Treaty provisions that they negotiated also allowed about half of the Miami people , including 43 members of Richardville 's family , to remain in Indiana after the remainder of the Miamis moved west in 1846 . Richardville also provided displaced Miamis in Indiana with a place to stay on the few hundred remaining acres of his property . Those who remained in Indiana were among the original 148 members of the Miami Nation of Indiana , which began on October 6 , 1846 . Over the years , some of Richardville 's family members migrated to what became the present-day states of Kansas and Oklahoma , but many more of his descendants remained in Indiana . For his role as a civil chief of the Miamis and a treaty negotiator , the U.S. government granted Richardville a total of 28,320 acres ( 11,460 hectares ) of land in Indiana under the terms of various treaties , as well as $ 31,800 in cash settlements . In addition , construction was completed in 1827 on a two-story brick resident that was partially funded by the U.S. government for Richardville and his family in Fort Wayne , Indiana , under the terms of the Treaty of Mississinewas .",

  "/wiki/Building": "A building , or edifice , is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place , such as a house or factory . Buildings come in a variety of sizes , shapes , and functions , and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors , from building materials available , to weather conditions , land prices , ground conditions , specific uses , and aesthetic reasons . To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures . Buildings serve several societal needs - primarily as shelter from weather , security , living space , privacy , to store belongings , and to comfortably live and work . A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat ( a place of comfort and safety ) and the outside ( a place that at times may be harsh and harmful ) . Ever since the first cave paintings , buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression . In recent years , interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings .",

The historic site continues to preserve and relate the story of pre-contact Middle Mississippian culture on the Ohio River . The site is named after the Angel family who in 1852 began purchasing farmland on which the archaeological site is located . In 1938 , the Indiana Historical Society , with funding from Eli Lilly , purchased 480 acres ( 190 hectares ) of property to preserve it and to use it for long-term archaeological excavation . From 1939 to 1942 , the Works Progress Administration employed more than 250 workers to excavate 120,000 square feet ( 11,000 m2 ) of the site , which resulted in the recording and processing of 2.3 million archaeological items . After excavation was temporarily halted during World War II , work resumed in 1945 as part of the Indiana University Archaeology Field School during the summer months .

It is the earlier/lower of two subperiods of the Carboniferous period lasting from roughly 358.9 to 323.2 million years ago . As with most other geochronologic units , the rock beds that define the Mississippian are well identified , but the exact start and end dates are uncertain by a few million years . The Mississippian is so named because rocks with this age are exposed in the Mississippi River valley . The Mississippian was a period of marine transgression in the Northern Hemisphere : the sea level was so high that only the Fennoscandian Shield and the Laurentian Shield were dry land . The cratons were surrounded by extensive delta systems and lagoons , and carbonate sedimentation on the surrounding continental platforms , covered by shallow seas . In North America , where the interval consists primarily of marine limestones , it is treated as a geologic period between the Devonian and the Pennsylvanian . During the Mississippian an important phase of orogeny occurred in the Appalachian Mountains . It is a major rock-building period named for the exposures in the Mississippi Valley region . The USGS geologic time scale shows its relation to other periods . In Europe , the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian are one more-or-less continuous sequence of lowland continental deposits and are grouped together as the Carboniferous system , and sometimes called the Upper Carboniferous and Lower Carboniferous instead .",

The facility was renamed Hinkle Fieldhouse in 1966 in honor of Butler 's longtime coach and athletic director , Paul D. Tony Hinkle . It is the sixth-oldest college basketball arena still in use , as well as the oldest and among the largest basketball arenas in NCAA 's Division I basketball , although its initial seating capacity of more than 15,000 has been reduced to 9,100 . Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1987 , Hinkle Fieldhouse is sometimes referred to as Indiana 's Basketball Cathedral . Hinkle Fieldhouse has served as the home court for the Butler Bulldogs men 's basketball team since 1928 ( with the exception of 1943 to 1945 , when it was converted to a military barracks during World War II ) and as the site of the annual Indiana High School Boys Basketball Tournament 's championship games from 1928 to 1971 . In addition to amateur and professional basketball games , it has hosted visits from U.S. presidents , indoor track events and bicycle races , professional tennis matches , circuses , and other civic and religious gatherings . The Butler Bulldogs men 's basketball team won the Horizon League conference title at Hinkle in 2010 . Several memorable high school basketball championship games were played at the Butler arena , including the 1954 title game , when tiny Milan High School s basketball team defeated a larger Muncie Central High School team . Milan 's team served as the inspiration for the movie Hoosiers ( 1986 ) , and the final scenes of the film 's championship game were filmed at Hinkle Fieldhouse .

Its original owners , Catharine and Levi Coffin , were Quaker abolitionists who provided fugitive slaves with supplies and a safe place to stay .

An active leader in the Underground Railroad in Indiana and Ohio , some unofficially called Coffin the President of the Underground Railroad , estimating that three thousand fugitive slaves passed through his care . The Coffin home in Fountain City , Wayne County , Indiana is now a museum , sometimes called the Underground Railroad 's Grand Central Station . Born near what became Greensboro , North Carolina , Coffin was exposed to and came to oppose slavery as a child . His family immigrated to Indiana in 1826 , avoiding slaveholders ' increasing persecution of Quakers , whose faith did not permit them to own slaves and who assisted fugitives . In Indiana , Coffin settled near the National Road with other Quakers in Wayne County , Indiana near the Ohio border . He farmed , as well as became a local merchant and business leader . Coffin grew wealthy from his various businesses assisting neighbors and travelers in the important transit corridor . Coffin became a major investor in and director of the local Richmond branch of the Second State Bank of Indiana in the 1830s , Richmond being the Wayne County seat . His financial position and standing in the community also helped supply food , clothing and transportation for Underground Railroad operations in the region . At the urging of friends in the anti-slavery movement , Coffin moved southward to the important Ohio River port city of Cincinnati in 1847 , where he ran a warehouse that sold only free-labor goods . Despite making considerable progress with the business , the free-labor venture proved unprofitable ; Coffin abandoned the enterprise after a decade .",
  "/wiki/Underground_Railroad": "The Underground Railroad was a network of secret routes and safe houses established in the United States during the early to mid-19th century , and used by enslaved African-Americans to escape into free states and Canada . The scheme was assisted by abolitionists and others sympathetic to the cause of the escapees . Not literally a railroad , the workers ( both black and white , free and enslaved ) who secretly aided the fugitives are also collectively referred to as the Underground Railroad . Various other routes led to Mexico , where slavery had been abolished , or overseas . An earlier escape route running south toward Florida , then a Spanish possession ( except 1763-83 ) , existed from the late 17th century until Florida became a United States territory in 1821 . One of the main reasons Florida was purchased by the United States was to end its function as a safe haven for escaped slaves . However , the network now generally known as the Underground Railroad was formed in the late 1700s . It ran north and grew steadily until the Civil War began . One estimate suggests that by 1850 , 100,000 slaves had escaped via the Railroad . British North America ( present-day Canada ) was a desirable destination , as its long border gave many points of access , it was further from slave catchers , and beyond the reach of the United States ' Fugitive Slave Acts . Most former slaves , reaching Canada by boat across Lake Erie and Lake Ontario , settled in Ontario . More than 30,000 people were said to have escaped there via the network during its 20-year peak period , although U.S. Census figures account for only 6,000 .",

  "/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs": "Eugene Victor Debs ( November 5 , 1855 - October 20 , 1926 ) was an American socialist , political activist , trade unionist , one of the founding members of the Industrial Workers of the World ( IWW ) and five times the candidate of the Socialist Party of America for President of the United States . Through his presidential candidacies as well as his work with labor movements , Debs eventually became one of the best-known socialists living in the United States . Early in his political career , Debs was a member of the Democratic Party . He was elected as a Democrat to the Indiana General Assembly in 1884 . After working with several smaller unions , including the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen , Debs led his union in a major ten-month strike against the CB & Q Railroad in 1888 , and lost . Debs was instrumental in the founding of the American Railway Union ( ARU ) , one of the nation 's first industrial unions . After workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company organized a wildcat strike over pay cuts in the summer of 1894 , Debs signed many into the ARU . He led a boycott by the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars in what became the nationwide Pullman Strike , affecting most lines west of Detroit and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states . Purportedly to keep the mail running , President Grover Cleveland used the United States Army to break the strike . As a leader of the ARU , Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison . In prison , Debs read various works of socialist theory and emerged six months later as a committed adherent of the international socialist movement . Debs was a founding member of the Social Democracy of America ( 1897 ) , the Social Democratic Party of America ( 1898 ) and the Socialist Party of America ( 1901 ) .",
  "/wiki/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World": "The Industrial Workers of the World ( IWW ) , members of which are commonly termed Wobblies , is an international labor union that was founded in 1905 in Chicago , Illinois , in the United States . The union combines general unionism with industrial unionism , as it is a general union , subdivided between the various industries which employ its members . The philosophy and tactics of the IWW are described as revolutionary industrial unionism , with ties to both socialist and anarchist labor movements . In the 1910s and early 1920s , the IWW achieved many of their short-term goals , particularly in the American West , and cut across traditional guild and union lines to organize workers in a variety of trades and industries . At their peak in August 1917 , IWW membership was more than 150,000 , with active wings in the United States , Canada , and Australia . The extremely high rate of IWW membership turnover during this era ( estimated at 133% per decade ) makes it difficult for historians to state membership totals with any certainty , as workers tended to join the IWW in large numbers for relatively short periods ( e.g. , during labor strikes and periods of generalized economic distress ) . Due to several factors , membership declined dramatically in the late 1910s and 1920s . There were conflicts with other labor groups , particularly the American Federation of Labor ( AFL ) , which regarded the IWW as too radical , while the IWW regarded the AFL as too conservative and dividing workers by craft . Membership also declined due to government crackdowns on radical , anarchist and socialist groups during the First Red Scare after World War I . In Canada the IWW was outlawed by the federal government . Probably the most decisive factor in the decline in IWW membership and influence , however , was a 1924 schism in the organization , from which the IWW never fully recovered . The IWW promotes the concept of One Big Union , and contends that all workers should be united as a social class to supplant capitalism and wage labor with industrial democracy .",
  "/wiki/American_Railway_Union": "The American Railway Union ( ARU ) was briefly among the largest labor unions of its time and one of the first industrial unions in the United States . Launched at a meeting held in Chicago in February 1893 , the ARU won an early victory in a strike on the Great Northern Railroad in the summer of 1893 . This successful strike was followed by the bitter 1894 Pullman Strike in which government troops and the power of the judiciary were enlisted against the ARU , ending with the jailing of the union 's leadership for six months in 1895 and effectively crushing the organization . The group 's blacklisted and dispirited remnants finally disbanded the organization via amalgamation into the Social Democracy of America ( SDA ) at its founding convention in June 1897 .",
  "/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_America": "The Socialist Party of America ( SPA ) was a democratic socialist and social democratic political party in the United States formed in 1901 by a merger between the three-year-old Social Democratic Party of America and disaffected elements of the Socialist Labor Party of America which had split from the main organization in 1899 . In the first decades of the 20th century , it drew significant support from many different groups , including trade unionists , progressive social reformers , populist farmers and immigrants . However , it refused to form coalitions with other parties , or even to allow its members to vote for other parties . Eugene V. Debs twice won over 900,000 votes in presidential elections ( 1912 and 1920 ) while the party also elected two Representatives ( Victor L. Berger and Meyer London ) , dozens of state legislators , more than a hundred mayors and countless lesser officials . The party 's staunch opposition to American involvement in World War I , although welcomed by many , also led to prominent defections , official repression and vigilante persecution . The organization was further shattered by a factional war over how to respond to the October Revolution in Imperial Russia in 1917 and the establishment of the Communist International in 1919 - many members left the party in favor of the Communist Party USA . After endorsing Robert M. La Follette 's presidential campaign in 1924 , the party returned to independent action at the presidential level . It had modest growth in the early 1930s behind presidential candidate Norman Thomas . The party 's appeal was weakened by the popularity of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal , the organization and flexibility of the Communist Party under Earl Browder and the resurgent labor movement 's desire to support sympathetic Democratic Party politicians . A divisive and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to broaden the party by admitting followers of Leon Trotsky and Jay Lovestone caused the traditional Old Guard to leave and form the Social Democratic Federation . While the party was always strongly anti-fascist as well as anti-Stalinist , its opposition to American entry in World War II cost it both internal and external support . The party stopped running presidential candidates after 1956 , when its nominee Darlington Hoopes won fewer than 6,000 votes .",

McKinley 's victory made him the first president to win consecutive re-election since Ulysses S. Grant had accomplished the same feat in 1872 . McKinley and Bryan each faced little opposition within their own party . Although some Gold Democrats explored the possibility of a campaign by Admiral George Dewey , Bryan was easily re-nominated at the 1900 Democratic National Convention after Dewey withdrew from the race . McKinley was unanimously re-nominated at the 1900 Republican National Convention . As Vice President Garret Hobart had died in 1899 , the Republican convention chose New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt as McKinley 's running mate . The return of economic prosperity and recent victory in the Spanish-American War helped McKinley to score a decisive victory , while Bryan 's anti-imperialist stance and continued support for bimetallism attracted only limited support . McKinley carried most states outside of the Solid South and won 51.6% of the popular vote . The election results were similar to those of 1896 , though McKinley picked up several Western states and Bryan picked up Kentucky .

Roosevelt took office in September 1901 following the assassination of his predecessor . After the February 1904 death of McKinley 's ally , Senator Mark Hanna , Roosevelt faced little opposition at the 1904 Republican National Convention . The conservative Bourbon Democrat allies of former President Grover Cleveland temporarily regained control of the Democratic Party from the followers of William Jennings Bryan , and the 1904 Democratic National Convention nominated Alton B. Parker , Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals . Parker triumphed on the second ballot of the convention , defeating newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst . As there was little difference between the candidates ' positions , the race was largely based on their personalities ; the Democrats argued the Roosevelt presidency was arbitrary and erratic . Republicans emphasized Roosevelt 's success in foreign affairs and his record of firmness against monopolies . Roosevelt easily defeated Parker , sweeping every region in the nation except the South . Two third-party candidates , Eugene V. Debs of the Socialist Party and Silas C.

This was the last presidential election in which one of the top-two finishers did not come from either the Democratic or Republican parties , signifying the primacy of these two parties in modern American politics . Roosevelt had served as President from 1901 to 1909 as a Republican , and Taft had won the 1908 Republican presidential nomination with his support . However , following Taft 's election , his actions as President displeased Roosevelt , who challenged him for the nomination at the 1912 Republican National Convention . After Taft and his conservative allies narrowly prevailed at the convention , Roosevelt rallied his progressive supporters and launched a third party bid . Roosevelt 's Progressive Party was nicknamed the Bull Moose Party after journalists quoted Roosevelt saying that he was feeling like a bull moose on the campaign trail shortly after the new party was formed . On the Democratic side , Wilson won the presidential nomination on the 46th ballot , defeating Speaker of the House Champ Clark and several other candidates with the support of William Jennings Bryan and other progressive Democrats . Meanwhile , the Socialist Party renominated its perennial standard-bearer , Eugene V. Debs . The 1912 election was bitterly contested by three individuals , Wilson , Roosevelt , and Taft , who all had or would serve as President .

Cox of Ohio . Incumbent Democratic President Woodrow Wilson privately hoped for a third term , but party leaders were unwilling to re-nominate the ailing and unpopular incumbent . Former President Theodore Roosevelt had been the front-runner for the Republican nomination , but he died in 1919 without leaving an obvious heir to his progressive legacy . With both Wilson and Roosevelt out of the running , the major parties turned to little-known dark horse candidates from the state of Ohio , a swing state with a large number of electoral votes . Cox won the 1920 Democratic National Convention on the 44th ballot , defeating William Gibbs McAdoo , A. Mitchell Palmer , and several other candidates . Harding emerged as a compromise candidate between the conservative and progressive wings of the party , and he clinched his nomination on the tenth ballot of the 1920 Republican National Convention . The election was dominated by the American social and political environment in the aftermath of World War I , which was marked by a hostile response to certain aspects of Wilson 's foreign policy and a massive reaction against the reformist zeal of the Progressive Era . The wartime economic boom had collapsed and the country was deep in a recession . Wilson 's advocacy for America 's entry into the League of Nations in the face of a return to non-interventionist opinion challenged his effectiveness as president , and overseas there were wars and revolutions . At home , the year 1919 was marked by major strikes in the meatpacking and steel industries and large-scale race riots in Chicago and other cities . Anarchist attacks on Wall Street produced fears of radicals and terrorists .",
  "/wiki/United_States_presidential_election": "The election of the president and the vice president of the United States is an indirect election in which citizens of the United States who are registered to vote in one of the fifty U.S. states or in Washington , D.C. , cast ballots not directly for those offices , but instead for members of the Electoral College . [ note 1 ] These electors then in turn cast direct votes , known as electoral votes , for president , and for vice president . The candidate who receives an absolute majority of electoral votes ( at least 270 out of a total of 538 , since the Twenty-Third Amendment granted voting rights to citizens of D.C. ) is then elected to that office . If no candidate receives an absolute majority of the votes for president , the House of Representatives chooses the winner ; if no one receives an absolute majority of the votes for vice president , then the Senate chooses the winner . The Electoral College and its procedure are established in the U.S. Constitution by Article II , Section 1 , Clauses 2 and 4 ; and the Twelfth Amendment ( which replaced Clause 3 after its ratification in 1804 ) . Under Clause 2 , each of the states casts as many electoral votes as the total number of its Senators and Representatives in Congress , while ( per the Twenty-third Amendment , ratified in 1961 ) Washington , D.C. , casts the same number of electoral votes as the least-represented state , which is three . Also under Clause 2 , the manner for choosing electors is determined by each state legislature , not directly by the federal government . Many state legislatures previously selected their electors directly , but over time all of them switched to using the popular vote to help determine electors , which persists today . Once chosen , electors generally cast their electoral votes for the candidate who won the plurality in their state , but at least 21 states do not have provisions that specifically address this behavior ; those who vote in opposition to the plurality are known as faithless or unpledged electors . In modern times , faithless and unpledged electors have not affected the ultimate outcome of an election , so the results can generally be determined based on the state-by-state popular vote . Presidential elections occur quadrennially with registered voters casting their ballots on Election Day , which since 1845 has been the first Tuesday after November 1 . This date coincides with the general elections of various other federal , state , and local races ; since local governments are responsible for managing elections , these races typically all appear on one ballot .",

Its first classes began offering secondary school instruction on November 27 , 1848 . The school was renamed Eleutherian College in 1854 , when it began offering college-level coursework . It is the second college in the United States west of the Allegheny Mountains and the first in Indiana to provide interracial education . The restored three-story stone chapel and classroom building was constructed between 1853 and 1856 and presently serves as a local history museum .

  "/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States": "Abolitionism ( or the Anti-Slavery Movement ) in the United States of America was the movement which sought to end slavery in the United States immediately , active both before and during the American Civil War . In the Americas and western Europe , abolitionism was a movement which sought to end the Atlantic slave trade and set slaves free . In the 17th century , enlightenment thinkers condemned slavery on humanistic grounds and English Quakers and some Evangelical denominations condemned slavery as un-Christian . At that time , most slaves were Africans , but thousands of Native Americans were also enslaved . In the 18th century , as many as six million Africans were transported to the Americas as slaves , at least a third of them on British ships to North America . The colony of Georgia originally prohibited slavery within its territory , and thereafter , abolition was part of the message of the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s in the Thirteen Colonies . During the Age of Enlightenment rationalist thinkers criticized slavery for violating people 's natural rights . A member of the British Parliament , James Edward Oglethorpe , was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery . The founder of the Province of Georgia , Oglethorpe banned slavery on humanistic grounds . He argued against it in Parliament and eventually encouraged his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause . Soon after his death in 1785 , Sharp and More joined with William Wilberforce and others in forming the Clapham Sect . Although anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century , many colonies , churches , and emerging nations ( notably in the southern United States ) continued to use and defend the traditions of slavery .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

  "/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison": "William Henry Harrison ( February 9 , 1773 - April 4 , 1841 ) was an American military officer and politician who served as the ninth president of the United States in 1841 . He died of typhoid , pneumonia or paratyphoid fever 31 days into his term ( the shortest tenure ) , becoming the first president to die in office . His death sparked a brief constitutional crisis regarding succession to the presidency , because the Constitution was unclear as to whether Vice President John Tyler should assume the office of president or merely execute the duties of the vacant office . Tyler claimed a constitutional mandate to become the new president and took the presidential oath of office , setting an important precedent for an orderly transfer of the presidency and its full powers when the previous president fails to complete the elected term . Harrison was born in Charles City County , Virginia , the son of Founding Father Benjamin Harrison V and the paternal grandfather of Benjamin Harrison , the 23rd president of the United States . He was the last president born as a British subject in the Thirteen Colonies before the start of the Revolutionary War in 1775 . During his early military career , he participated in the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers , an American military victory that effectively ended the Northwest Indian War . Later , he led a military force against Tecumseh 's Confederacy at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811 , where he earned the nickname Old Tippecanoe . He was promoted to major general in the Army in the War of 1812 , and in 1813 led American infantry and cavalry at the Battle of the Thames in Upper Canada . Harrison began his political career in 1798 , when he was appointed Secretary of the Northwest Territory , and in 1799 he was elected as the territory 's delegate in the House of Representatives . Two years later , President John Adams named him governor of the newly established Indiana Territory , a post he held until 1812 .

The territory originally contained approximately 259,824 square miles ( 672,940 km2 ) of land , but its size was decreased when it was subdivided to create the Michigan Territory ( 1805 ) and the Illinois Territory ( 1809 ) . The Indiana Territory was the first new territory created from lands of the Northwest Territory , which had been organized under the terms of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 . The territorial capital was the settlement around the old French fort of Vincennes on the Wabash River , until transferred in to Corydon near the Ohio River in 1813 . William Henry Harrison , the territory 's first governor , oversaw treaty negotiations with the native inhabitants that ceded tribal lands to the U.S. government , opening large parts of the territory to further settlement . In 1809 the U.S. Congress established a bicameral legislative body for the territory that included a popularly-elected House of Representatives and a Legislative Council . In addition , the territorial government began planning for a basic transportation network and education system , but efforts to attain statehood for the territory were delayed due to war . At the outbreak of Tecumseh 's War , when the territory was on the front line of battle , Harrison led a military force in the opening hostilities at the Battle of Tippecanoe ( 1811 ) and in the subsequent invasion of Canada during the War of 1812 . After Harrison resigned as the territorial governor , Thomas Posey was appointed to the vacant governorship , but the opposition party , led by Congressman Jonathan Jennings , dominated territorial affairs in its final years and began pressing for statehood . In June 1816 a constitutional convention was held at Corydon , where a state constitution was adopted on June 29 , 1816 . General elections were held in August to fill offices for the new state government , the new officeholders were sworn into office in November , and the territory was dissolved .

Born in the Ohio Country ( present-day Ohio ) , and growing up during the American Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian War , Tecumseh was exposed to warfare and envisioned the establishment of an independent Native American nation east of the Mississippi River under British protection . He worked to recruit additional members to his tribal confederacy from the southern United States . Tecumseh was among the most celebrated Native American leaders in history and was known as a strong and eloquent orator who promoted tribal unity . He was also ambitious , willing to take risks , and make significant sacrifices to repel the settlers from Native American lands in the Old Northwest Territory . In 1808 , with his brother Tenskwatawa ( The Prophet ) , Tecumseh founded the Native American village the European Americans called Prophetstown , north of present-day Lafayette , Indiana . Prophetstown grew into a large , multi-tribal community and a central point in Tecumseh 's political and military alliance . Tecumseh 's confederation fought the United States during Tecumseh 's War , but he was unsuccessful in getting the U.S. government to rescind the Treaty of Fort Wayne ( 1809 ) and other land-cession treaties . In 1811 , as he traveled south to recruit more allies , his brother Tenskwatawa defended Prophetstown against William Henry Harrison 's army at the Battle of Tippecanoe , but the Native Americans retreated from the field and the European Americans unearthed graves and burned Prophetstown . Although Tecumseh remained the military leader of the pan-Native American confederation , his plan to enlarge the Native American alliance was never fulfilled . Tecumseh and his confederacy continued to fight the United States after forming an alliance with Great Britain in the War of 1812 .

Better known as the Indy 500 or the Indianapolis 500 , it is held annually at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway ( IMS ) in Speedway , Indiana , United States , an enclave suburb of Indianapolis , Indiana . The event is held over Memorial Day weekend in late May . It is contested as part of the IndyCar Series , the top level of American Championship Car racing , an open-wheel open-cockpit formula colloquially known as Indy Car Racing . The name of the race is often shortened to Indy 500 , and the track itself is nicknamed the Brickyard , as the racing surfacing was paved in brick in the fall of 1909 , with a yard of brick remaining exposed at the start/finish line . The event billed as The Greatest Spectacle in Racing , is considered part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport , which comprises three of the most prestigious motorsports events in the world , also including the Monaco Grand Prix and the 24 Hours of Le Mans . The official attendance is not disclosed by Speedway management , but the permanent seating capacity is upwards of 250,000 , and infield patrons raise the race-day attendance to approximately 300,000 . It shares its date with NASCAR 's 600-mile event at Charlotte , with drivers having completed both events in one day before in a so-called Double Duty . The inaugural race was held in 1911 and was won by Ray Harroun . The event celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011 , and the 100th running was held in 2016 . The event was put on hiatus twice , from 1917 to 1918 due to World War I and from 1942 to 1945 due to World War II . Simon Pagenaud is the current champion ."
