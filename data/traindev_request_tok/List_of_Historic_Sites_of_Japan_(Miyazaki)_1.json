Between 1853 and 1867 , Japan ended its isolationist foreign policy known as sakoku and changed from a feudal Tokugawa shogunate to the pre-modern empire of the Meiji government . The major ideological-political divide during this period was between the pro-imperial nationalists called ishin shishi and the shogunate forces , which included the elite shinsengumi swordsmen . Although these two groups were the most visible powers , many other factions attempted to use the chaos of Bakumatsu to seize personal power . [ page needed ] Furthermore , there were two other main driving forces for dissent : first , growing resentment on the part of the tozama daimy\u014d ( or outside lords ) , and second , growing anti-Western sentiment following the arrival of Matthew C. Perry . The first related to those lords whose predecessors had fought against Tokugawa forces at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 and had , from that point on , been excluded permanently from all powerful positions within the shogunate . The second was to be expressed in the phrase sonn\u014d j\u014di , or revere the Emperor , expel the barbarians . The turning point of the Bakumatsu was during the Boshin War and the Battle of Toba-Fushimi when pro-shogunate forces were defeated . [ page needed ]",
