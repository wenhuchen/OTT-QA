  "/wiki/Juris_Doctor": "The Juris Doctor degree ( J.D . or JD ) , also known as the Doctor of Jurisprudence degree ( J.D. , JD , D.Jur . or DJur ) , is a graduate-entry professional degree in law and one of several Doctor of Law degrees . The Juris Doctor is earned by completing law school in Australia , Canada , the United States , and some other common law countries . It has the academic standing of a professional doctorate ( in contrast to a research doctorate ) in the United States , a master 's degree in Australia , and a second-entry baccalaureate degree in Canada ( in all three jurisdictions the same as other professional degrees such as M.D . or D.D.S./D.M.D. , the degrees required to be a practicing physician or dentist , respectively ) . The degree was first awarded in the United States in the early 20th century and was created as a modern version of the old European doctor of law degree ( such as the Dottore in Giurisprudenza in Italy and the Juris Utriusque Doctor in Germany and central Europe ) . Originating from the 19th-century Harvard movement for the scientific study of law and first denominated LL.B. , it is a degree that in most common law jurisdictions is the primary professional preparation for lawyers . It traditionally involves a three-year program , although some U.S. law schools offer a two-year accelerated program in which students complete courses over two additional summer semesters . The LL.B . was largely replaced by the J.D . in the US in the later 20th century .",

  "/wiki/United_States_federal_judge": "In the United States , the title of federal judge means a judge ( pursuant to Article Three of the United States Constitution ) nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate pursuant to the Appointments Clause in Article II of the United States Constitution . In addition to the Supreme Court of the United States , whose existence and some aspects of whose jurisdiction are beyond the constitutional power of Congress to alter , Congress has established 13 courts of appeals ( also called circuit courts ) with appellate jurisdiction over different regions of the United States , and 94 United States district courts . Every judge appointed to such a court may be categorized as a federal judge ; such positions include the chief justice and associate justices of the Supreme Court , circuit judges of the courts of appeals , and district judges of the United States district courts . All of these judges described thus far are referred to sometimes as Article III judges because they exercise the judicial power vested in the judicial branch of the federal government by Article III of the U.S. Constitution . In addition , judges of the Court of International Trade exercise judicial power pursuant to Article III . Other judges serving in the federal courts , including magistrate judges and bankruptcy judges , are also sometimes referred to as federal judges ; however , they are neither appointed by the president nor confirmed by the Senate , and their power derives from Article I instead .",

Some liberal arts colleges in the United States offer only the BA , even in the natural sciences , while some universities offer only the BS , even in non-science fields . At universities that offer both BA and BS degrees in the same discipline , the BS degree is usually more extensive in that particular discipline and is targeted toward students who are pursuing graduate school or a profession in that field .",
