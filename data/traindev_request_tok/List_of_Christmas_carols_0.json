  "/wiki/Peter_Warlock": "Philip Arnold Heseltine ( 30 October 1894 - 17 December 1930 ) , known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock , was a British composer and music critic . The Warlock name , which reflects Heseltine 's interest in occult practices , was used for all his published musical works . He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music ; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle . As a schoolboy at Eton College , Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius , with whom he formed a close friendship . After a failed student career in Oxford and London , Heseltine turned to musical journalism , while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music . His first serious compositions date from around 1915 . Following a period of inactivity , a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren ; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland , studying Celtic culture and language . On his return to England in 1918 , Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive , original style , while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic . During 1920-21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut . His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s , when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent . Through his critical writings , published under his own name , Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music . In addition , he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote , edited , or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets .",

  "/wiki/The_First_Noel": "The First Nowell ( also written The First No\u00ebl or The First Noel ) is a traditional English Christmas carol with Cornish origins , most likely from the early modern period , although possibly earlier . The First Nowell is of Cornish origin . Its current form was first published in Carols Ancient and Modern ( 1823 ) and Gilbert and Sandys Carols ( 1833 ) , both of which were edited by William Sandys and arranged , edited and with extra lyrics written by Davies Gilbert for Hymns and Carols of God . Nowell is an Early Modern English synonym of Christmas from French No\u00ebl the Christmas season , ultimately from Latin natalis [ dies ] [ day ] of birth . The word was regularly used in the burden of carols in the middle ages towards the early modern period ; Sir Christ\u00e8mas ( Ritson Manuscript ) , Nowell sing we now all and some ( Trinity Carol Roll ) and Nowel - out of youre slepe arise and wake ( Selden Carol Book ) being 15th century examples . The melody is unusual among English folk melodies in that it consists of one musical phrase repeated twice , followed by a refrain which is a variation on that phrase . All three phrases end on the third of the scale . Writing in the Journal of the Folk-Song Society in 1915 , Anne Gilchrist notes it was not recorded prior to Sandys ' publication . She speculated based on a set of church gallery parts discovered in Westmorland that the tune may have had its origin as a treble part to another carol Hark , hark the angels sing ; her suggestion was that the treble part was passed down orally and was later remembered as the melody rather than a harmony . A conjectural reconstruction of this earlier version can be found in the New Oxford Book of Carols . Today , The First Nowell is usually performed in a four-part hymn arrangement by the English composer John Stainer , first published in his Carols , New and Old in 1871 . Variations of its theme are included in Victor Hely-Hutchinson 's Carol Symphony ."
