  "/wiki/Great_Western_Railway": "The Great Western Railway ( GWR ) was a British railway company that linked London with the southwest and west of England , the West Midlands , and most of Wales . It was founded in 1833 , received its enabling Act of Parliament on 31 August 1835 and ran its first trains in 1838 . It was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel , who chose a broad gauge of 7 ft ( 2,134 mm ) - later slightly widened to 7 ft 1\u20444 in ( 2,140 mm ) - but , from 1854 , a series of amalgamations saw it also operate 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ( 1,435 mm ) standard-gauge trains ; the last broad-gauge services were operated in 1892 . The GWR was the only company to keep its identity through the Railways Act 1921 , which amalgamated it with the remaining independent railways within its territory , and it was finally merged at the end of 1947 when it was nationalised and became the Western Region of British Railways . The GWR was called by some God 's Wonderful Railway and by others the Great Way Round but it was famed as the Holiday Line , taking many people to English and Bristol Channel resorts in the West Country as well as the far southwest of England such as Torquay in Devon , Minehead in Somerset , and Newquay and St Ives in Cornwall . The company 's locomotives , many of which were built in the company 's workshops at Swindon , were painted a Brunswick green colour while , for most of its existence , it used a two-tone chocolate and cream livery for its passenger coaches . Goods wagons were painted red but this was later changed to mid-grey . Great Western trains included long-distance express services such as the Flying Dutchman , the Cornish Riviera Express and the Cheltenham Spa Express . It also operated many suburban and rural services , some operated by steam railmotors or autotrains . The company pioneered the use of larger , more economic goods wagons than were usual in Britain . It operated a network of road motor ( bus ) routes , was a part of the Railway Air Services , and owned ships , docks and hotels .",

  "/wiki/Venetian_Gothic_architecture": "Venetian Gothic is the local variant architectural style for Venice of Italian Gothic architecture , with a confluence of influences from local building requirements , some influence from Byzantine architecture , and some from Islamic architecture , reflecting Venice 's trading network . Very unusually for medieval architecture , the style is both at its most characteristic in secular buildings , and the great majority of survivals are secular . The best-known examples are the Doge 's Palace and the Ca ' d'Oro . Both feature loggias of closely spaced small columns , with heavy tracery with quatrefoil openings above , decoration along the roofline , and some coloured patterning to plain wall surfaces . Together with the ogee arch , capped with a relief ornament , and ropework reliefs , these are the most iconic characteristics of the style . Ecclesiastical Gothic architecture tended to be less distinctively Venetian , and closer to that in the rest of Italy . The beginning of the style probably goes back no further than the 13th century , although the dates of early Gothic palaces , and especially features such as windows in them , are largely uncertain . It dominated the 14th century and because of the city 's conservatism Venetian Gothic buildings , especially smaller palaces , continued to be built well into the second half of the 15th century , and Venetian Renaissance architecture very often retained reminiscences of its Gothic predecessor .",
  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",
