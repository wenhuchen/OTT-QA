  "/wiki/Julius_Skutnabb": "Julius Ferninand Skutnabb ( 12 June 1889 - 26 February 1965 ) was a Finnish speed skater . A fireman by profession , he made his international debut at the World Allround Championships in 1914 , but his international career was interrupted by World War I . He kept competing nationally , becoming the Finnish Allround Champion in 1914 , 1916 , and 1917. International activity resumed in 1922 and Skutnabb , already 32 years old , finished fifth at the World Allround Championships that year . After placing sixth at the world championships the following year , his best year came in 1924 . At the 1924 Winter Olympics of Chamonix , he first won silver on the 5,000 m behind compatriot Clas Thunberg ; the next day he became Olympic Champion on the 10,000 m , while Thunberg took silver . Since these were the first Winter Olympics to be held , his 10,000 m time automatically was the Olympic record . These performances , combined with his 500 m and 1,500 m times during those Olympics , were good enough for a third place in the allround competition ( which was also an Olympic speed skating event , but only in 1924 ) , and Skutnabb returned home with three medals - one of each colour . Later in 1924 Skutnabb won a bronze medal at the World Allround Championships , and in 1926 he became European Allround Champion . Skutnabb participated in the 1928 Winter Olympics and won his second 5,000 m Olympic silver medal ( this time behind Ivar Ballangrud ) at the age of 38 years and 246 days .",
