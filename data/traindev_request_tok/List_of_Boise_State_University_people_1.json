  "/wiki/U.S._Congressman": "The United States House of Representatives is the lower house of the United States Congress , the Senate being the upper house . Together they compose the national legislature of the United States . The composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled to one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all representatives have been directly elected . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty-three representatives . Seven states have only one representative : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont , and Wyoming . The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation , known as bills , which , after concurrence by the Senate , are sent to the president for consideration . In addition to this basic power , the House has certain exclusive powers , among them the power to initiate all bills related to revenue ; the impeachment of federal officers , who are sent to trial before the Senate ; and , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for president , the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office , with one vote given to each state for that purpose .

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion . Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force , with the United States providing around 90% of the military personnel . After the first two months of war , South Korean Army ( ROKA ) and the US forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat . As a result , the ROKA and US troops retreated to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Army": "The United States Army ( USA ) is the land warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces . It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services , and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution . As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence , the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army , which was formed ( 14 June 1775 ) to fight the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) - before the United States of America was established as a country . After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775 . As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It is the largest military branch , and in the fiscal year 2017 , the projected end strength for the Regular Army ( USA ) was 476,000 soldiers ; the Army National Guard ( ARNG ) had 343,000 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve ( USAR ) had 199,000 soldiers ; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers .

  "/wiki/Minority_Leader": "In U.S. politics , the minority leader is the floor leader of the second largest caucus in a legislative body . Given the two-party nature of the U.S. system , the minority leader is almost inevitably either a Republican or a Democrat . The position could be considered similar to that of the Leader of the Opposition in parliamentary systems . In bicameral legislatures , the counterpart to the minority leader in the lower house is the Speaker , and the majority leader is hence only the second-most senior member of the majority caucus . Contrastingly , in upper houses , the titular Speaker is frequently a separately elected officer such as a lieutenant governor or vice president . The minority leader is often assisted in his/her role by one or more whips , whose job is to enforce party discipline on votes deemed to be crucial by the party leadership and to ensure that members do not vote against the position of the party leaders . Some votes are deemed to be so crucial as to lead to punitive measures ( such as demotion from choice committee assignments ) for members who violate the party line ; decisions such as these are often made by the minority leader in conjunction with other senior party leaders . In a state where the executive branch and both houses of the state legislature are controlled by the other party , the minority leader of one of the houses ( most often the upper one ) may be seen as the most senior member of the party in that state with regard to state government ( although inferior in rank to a United States Senator or United States Representative , if there be such in that party from that state ) . At times , particularly during crucial legislation , the minority leader may be consulted by the opposite leader in order to more easily get things passed and ensure that provisions important to the interests the minority party be included .

The Coeur d'Alene have sovereign control of their Coeur d'Alene Reservation , which includes a significant portion of Lake Coeur d'Alene and its submerged lands . In Idaho v. United States ( 2001 ) , the United States Supreme Court ruled against the state 's claim of the submerged lands of the lower third of Lake Coeur d'Alene and related waters of the St. Joe River . It said that the Coeur d'Alene were the traditional owners and that the Executive Branch and Congress had clearly included this area in their reservation , with compensation for ceded territory . This area was designated in 1983 by the Environmental Protection Agency as Bunker Hill Mine and Smelting Complex , the nation 's second-largest Superfund site for cleanup . Concerned at the slow pace of progress , in 1991 the tribe filed suit against mining companies for damages and cleanup costs , joined in 1996 by the United States and in 2011 by the state of Idaho . Settlements were reached with major defendants in 2008 and 2011 , providing funds to be used in removal of hazardous wastes and restoration of habitat and natural resources . Historically the Coeur d'Alene occupied a territory of 3.5 million acres in present-day northern Idaho , eastern Washington and western Montana . They lived in villages along the Coeur d'Alene , St. Joe , Clark Fork , and Spokane rivers , as well as sites on the shores of Lake Coeur d'Alene , Lake Pend Oreille , and Hayden Lake .

  "/wiki/U.S._Senator": "The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress , which , along with the United States House of Representatives - the lower chamber - constitutes the legislature of the United States . The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building , in Washington , D.C . The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",
