  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Ch\u00e2teauesque": "Ch\u00e2teauesque ( or Francis I style , or in Canada , the Ch\u00e2teau Style ) is a Revivalist architectural style based on the French Renaissance architecture of the monumental French Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley from the late fifteenth century to the early seventeenth century . The term ch\u00e2teauesque ( literally , ch\u00e2teau-like ) is credited ( by historian Marcus Whiffen ) to American architectural historian Bainbridge Bunting although it can be found in publications that pre-date Bunting 's birth . As of 2011 , the Getty Research Institute 's Art & Architecture Thesaurus includes both Ch\u00e2teau Style and Ch\u00e2teauesque , with the former being the preferred term for North America . The style frequently features buildings incongruously ornamented by the elaborate towers , spires , and steeply-pitched roofs of sixteenth century ch\u00e2teaux , themselves influenced by late Gothic and Italian Renaissance architecture . Despite their French ornamentation , as a revival style , buildings in the ch\u00e2teauesque style do not attempt to completely emulate a French ch\u00e2teau . Ch\u00e2teauesque buildings are typically built on an asymmetrical plan with a roof-line broken in several places and a facade composed of advancing and receding planes .",

The site was previously called Wascana ( Buffalo Bones in Cree ) , but was renamed to Regina ( Latin for Queen ) in 1882 in honour of Queen Victoria . This decision was made by Queen Victoria 's daughter Princess Louise , who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada , the Marquess of Lorne . Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West , on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off , Wascana Creek . Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 260-metre ( 850 ft ) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake . Regina 's importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906 .",
