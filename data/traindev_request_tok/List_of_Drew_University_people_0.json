  "/wiki/Korea": "Korea is a region in East Asia consisting of the Korean Peninsula , Jeju Island , and several minor islands near the peninsula . Korea has been divided since 1948 between two distinct sovereign states , North Korea and South Korea . Korea is bordered by Russia to the northeast , China to the northwest , and neighbours Japan to the east via the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan ( East Sea ) . During the first half of the 1st millennium , Korea was divided between the three competing states of Goguryeo , Baekje , and Silla , together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea . In the second half of the 1st millennium , Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo , leading to the Unified Silla period . Meanwhile , Balhae formed in the north , superseding former Goguryeo . Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war , ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms . Toward the end of the 1st millennium , Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo , which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state . Around the same time , Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo . Goryeo ( also spelled as Kory\u014f ) , whose name developed into the modern exonym Korea , was a highly cultured state that created the world 's first metal movable type in 1234 . However , multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation , which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting . Following military resistance under King Gongmin that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo , severe political strife followed , and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye , who established Joseon in July 17 , 1392 .",
