  "/wiki/Personal_Computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems . The advent of personal computers and the concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of people in all countries .",
  "/wiki/Online": "In computer technology and telecommunications , online indicates a state of connectivity , and offline indicates a disconnected state . In modern terminology this usually refers to an Internet connection , but ( especially when expressed on line or on the line ) could refer to any piece of equipment or functional unit that is connected to a larger system . Being online means that the equipment or subsystem is connected , or that it is ready for use . Online has come to describe activities performed on and data available on the Internet , for example : online identity , online predator , online gambling , online shopping , online banking , and online learning . Similar meaning is also given by the prefixes cyber and e , as in the words cyberspace , cybercrime , email , and ecommerce . In contrast , offline can refer to either computing activities performed while disconnected from the Internet , or alternatives to Internet activities ( such as shopping in brick-and-mortar stores ) . The term offline is sometimes used interchangeably with the acronym IRL , meaning in real life .",

  "/wiki/Survival_horror": "Survival horror is a subgenre of video games inspired by horror fiction that focuses on survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience . Although combat can be part of the gameplay , the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition , health , speed and vision , or through various obstructions of the player 's interaction with the game mechanics . The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game . Games make use of strong horror themes , like dark mazelike environments and unexpected attacks from enemies . The term survival horror was first used for the original Japanese release of Resident Evil in 1996 , which was influenced by earlier games with a horror theme such as 1989 's Sweet Home and 1992 's Alone in the Dark . The name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay , and has been retroactively applied to earlier titles . Starting with the release of Resident Evil 4 in 2005 , the genre began to incorporate more features from action games and more traditional first person and third-person shooter games . This has led game journalists to question whether long-standing survival horror franchises and more recent franchises have abandoned the genre and moved into a distinct genre often referred to as action horror .",

Bloodborne began development in 2012 under the working title of Project Beast . Bearing many similarities to the Souls series of games by the same developer and director , Bloodborne was partially inspired by the literary works of authors H. P. Lovecraft and Bram Stoker , and the architectural design of certain real world locations in places such as Romania and the Czech Republic . The decision by game director Hidetaka Miyazaki to create a new intellectual property ( IP ) and not another Souls game was made because he wanted to create something different ; at the same time , Sony wanted a new IP to be made exclusively for the PlayStation 4 . Bloodborne received critical acclaim , with praise being directed at its gameplay , particularly its high level of difficulty , sound design , atmospheric environments , interconnected world design , and plot . However , some criticism was directed at its technical performance at launch , which was improved with post-release updates .",

Though the roguelikes Beneath Apple Manor and Sword of Fargoal predate it , the 1980 game Rogue , which is an ASCII based game that runs in terminal or terminal emulator , is considered the forerunner and the namesake of the genre , with derivative games mirroring Rogue 's character- or sprite-based graphics .

Some of the better-known variants include Hack , NetHack , Ancient Domains of Mystery , Moria , Angband , Tales of Maj'Eyal , and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup . The Japanese series of Mystery Dungeon games by Chunsoft , inspired by Rogue , also fall within the concept of roguelike games .
