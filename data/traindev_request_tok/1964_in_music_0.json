Together with Stockhausen 's immediately preceding work Mixtur , for five orchestra groups , four sine-wave generators , four ring modulators , they form a tryptych of live-electronic works , where electronic transformations are accomplished during the performance ( as opposed to studio-produced electronic music on tape ) .
