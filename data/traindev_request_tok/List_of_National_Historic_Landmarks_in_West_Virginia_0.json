On Washington 's recommendation , the Continental Congress made Gates the Adjutant General of the Continental Army in 1775 .

Shortly after Gates took charge of the Northern Department , the Continental Army defeated the British at the crucial Battles of Saratoga .

Weston State Hospital got its name in 1913 which was used while patients occupied it , but was changed back to its originally commissioned , unused name , the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum , after being reopened as a tourist attraction . Designed by Gothic Revival and Tudor Revival styles by Baltimore architect Richard Snowden Andrews , it was constructed from 1858-1881 . Originally designed to hold 250 people , it became overcrowded in the 1950s with 2,400 patients . It was forcibly closed in 1994 due to changes in patient treatment . The hospital was bought by Joe Jordan in 2007 , and is opened for tours and other events to raise money for its restoration . The hospital 's main building is claimed to be one of the largest hand-cut stone masonry buildings in the United States , and the second largest hand-cut sandstone building in the world , with the only bigger one being in the Moscow Kremlin .

  "/wiki/Wheeling_Suspension_Bridge": "The Wheeling Suspension Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the main channel of the Ohio River at Wheeling , West Virginia . It was the largest suspension bridge in the world from 1849 until 1851 . Charles Ellet Jr. ( who also worked on the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge ) designed it and supervised construction of what became the first bridge to span a major river west of the Appalachian mountains . It linked the eastern and western section of the National Road , and became especially strategically important during the American Civil War . Litigation in the United States Supreme Court concerning its obstruction of the new high steamboat smokestacks eventually cleared the way for other bridges , especially needed by expanding railroads . Because this bridge was designed during the horse-and-buggy era , 2-ton weight limits and vehicle separation requirements now apply . The main span is 1,010 feet ( 310 m ) from tower to tower . The east tower rests on the Wheeling shore , while the west tower is on Wheeling Island . The east tower is 153.5 feet ( 46.8 m ) above the low-water level of the river , or 82 feet ( 25 m ) from the base of the masonry . The west tower is 132.75 feet ( 40.46 m ) above low water , with 69 feet ( 21 m ) of masonry . Detailed analysis of the bridge was conducted by Dr. Emory Kemp . The Wheeling Suspension Bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 15 , 1975 ."
