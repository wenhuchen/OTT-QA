As of the 2010 Census , it has the highest per-capita income , Human Development Index ( 0.962 ) , and median household income in the United States . It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east , Massachusetts to the north , New York to the west , and Long Island Sound to the south . Its capital is Hartford and its most populous city is Bridgeport . It is part of New England , although portions of it are often grouped with New York and New Jersey as the tri-state area . The state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the state . The word Connecticut is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for long tidal river . Connecticut 's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small , short-lived settlement called Fort Hoop in Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers . Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony New Netherland , which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers , although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English . Thomas Hooker led a band of followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony ; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony . The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders , considered the first constitutions in America . In 1662 , the three colonies were merged under a royal charter , making Connecticut a crown colony .",

  "/wiki/Maryland": "Maryland ( US : /\u02c8m\u025br\u0259l\u0259nd/ ( listen ) MERR-\u0259-l\u0259nd ) [ a ] is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States , bordering Virginia , West Virginia , and the District of Columbia to its south and west ; Pennsylvania to its north ; and Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean to its east . The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

The Lone Star can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal . The origin of Texas 's name is from the word taysha , which means friends in the Caddo language . Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault , Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions . Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts , less than 10% of Texas 's land area is desert . Most of the population centers are in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline .

On July 14 , 1983 , the House Ethics Committee recommended that Rep. Dan Crane ( R-IL ) and Rep.

Though at least some of the sexual contact was not criminal , the committee felt any sexual relationship between a member of the House of Representatives and a congressional page , or any sexual advance by a member to a page , represents a serious breach of duty . The Congressional Report found that in 1980 , a year after entering office , Crane had sex four or five times at his suburban apartment with a female page and in 1973 , the year he entered office , Studds invited a male page , who testified he felt no ill will towards Studds , to his Georgetown apartment and later on a two-week trip to Portugal . Both representatives admitted to the charges . On July 20 , 1983 , the House voted by a supermajority to revise the reprimand recommendation to censure , a more extreme measure . Censure had never previously been used in a case of sexual misconduct . The motion to censure the two House members was introduced by Rep. Robert H. Michel ( R-IL ) , the Republican House Minority Leader . Aides later said that Michel proposed this bill to head off a move by Republicans to expel the two legislators . Rep. Newt Gingrich ( R-GA ) was one of the leaders of the calls for the expulsion of Crane and Studds . At the beginning of the debate , Rep. Crane said , I want the members to know I am sorry and that I apologize to one and all . When he was called to be censured , Rep. Crane stood facing the House .",
