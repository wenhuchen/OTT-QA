  "/wiki/Chevrolet_Small-Block_engine": "The Chevrolet small-block engine is a series of V8 automobile engines used in normal production by the Chevrolet division of General Motors between 1954 and 2003 , using the same basic engine block . Referred to as a small-block for its comparative size relative to the physically much larger Chevrolet big-block engines , the family spanned from 262 cu in ( 4.3 L ) to 400 cu in ( 6.6 L ) in displacement . Engineer Ed Cole is credited with leading the design for this engine . Generation I and Generation II LT engines are distinct from subsequent LS based small-block engines . The Generation II engine is largely an improved version of the Generation I , having many interchangeable parts and dimensions . Later generation engines have only the rod bearings , transmission-to-block bolt pattern and bore spacing in common with the Generation I and II engines . Production of the original small-block began in late 1954 for the 1955 model year , with a displacement of 265 cu in ( 4.3 L ) , growing over time to 400 cu in ( 6.6 L ) by 1970 . Among the intermediate displacements were the 283 cu in ( 4.6 L ) , 327 cu in ( 5.4 L ) , and numerous 350 cu in ( 5.7 L ) versions . Introduced as a performance engine in 1967 , the 350 went on to be employed in both high- and low-output variants across the entire Chevrolet product line . Although all of Chevrolet 's siblings of the period ( Buick , Cadillac , Oldsmobile , Pontiac , and Holden ) designed their own V8s , it was the Chevrolet 305 and 350 cu in ( 5.0 and 5.7 L ) small-block that became the GM corporate standard . Over the years , every American General Motors division except Saturn and Geo used it and its descendants in their vehicles . Finally superseded by the Generation III LS in the 1997 and discontinued in 2003 , the engine is still made by a GM subsidiary in Mexico as a crate engine for replacement and hot rodding purposes .",
  "/wiki/V8_engine": "A V8 engine is an eight-cylinder piston engine where the cylinders share a common crankshaft and are arranged in a V configuration . The first known working V8 engine was produced by the French company Antoinette in 1904 for use in aircraft , and the 1914-1935 Cadillac L-Head engine is considered the first automotive V8 engine to be produced in significant quantities . The popularity of V8 engines in cars was greatly increased following the 1932 introduction of the Ford Flathead V8 .",

  "/wiki/Graeme_Lawrence": "Graeme Lawrence is a former race car driver from New Zealand . He started serious motor racing in the National 1.5 litre series ( NZ equivalent of F3 ) winning the series decisively in 1968 ahead of David Oxton and Ken Smith . Lawrence then ran half a European F2 series in an uncompetitive semi works F2 McLaren , he found the racing harder than expected and was shaken , by his experience racing in Germany at the Hockenheim race in the rain , were Jim Clark was killed . McLaren allowed Lawrence to build up another F2 chassis in his works and was 2nd in the NZ Gold Star series in the car , and first NZ driver home in the Tasman races at Pukekohe and Levin . Lawrence was the first New Zealander to win a race in the Tasman Series , in 1970 . Although he won only the one race that year , he was Tasman Series champion , driving Chris Amon 's old Dino 246 Tasmania . He won New Zealand 's Gold Star Race Championship for single seaters in the 1970-71 driving the Ferrari , and then ran the full Can Am series in an elderly McLaren sponsored by Canadian interests . Lawrence regularly qualified in mid grid , and suggested he still had international potential . This was confirmed by brilliant driving of the underpowered Dino 2.4 in the 1971 Tasman , at Levin he passed Amon in a March 701 , Oxton and Cannon and was closing on 2nd placed Neil Allen , when he collided with a lapped back marker and at Levin he finished third ahead of Amon and Gardiner , but a bad crash in a new Lola F5000 at Pukekohe in 1972 , left Lawrence with the Lola limp and largely ended any chance of a racing career in the United States and he did not fully recover till the 1974-75 race season driving a Lola T332 Formula 5000 car . which Lawrence set up largely to the pattern of the US F5000 Parnelli cars of Andretti and Unser . In the 1975 Tasman he was narrowly defeated by Warwick Brown , but for the following two season he lost his Marlboro and Singapore Airline sponsorship and his Lola 332T was less reliable , although in the 1976 NZ international series , he briefly led at Pukekohe and won at Teretonga and in 1977 a devastating drive at Oran Park , from the back of the field took him 4th at behind Alan Jones , Peter Gethin and Warwick Brown , before retiring , mid race . In Australasian F5000 races , Lawrence had driven hard , racing for victory rather than adopting the percentage driving tactics of say a John McCormick , David Oxton or John Walker , inevitably that resulted in more retirements and crashes .",

  "/wiki/Brian_Hart_Ltd.": "Brian Hart Ltd. , also known as Hart and Hart Racing Engines , was a motor racing engine manufacturer that participated in 157 Formula One Grands Prix , powering a total of 368 entries . Founded in 1969 by British engineer Brian Hart , Hart initially concentrated on servicing and tuning engines from other manufacturers for various independent British teams at all levels of motorsport . Hart found particular success with developments of Ford 's FVA engine , eventually leading the large multinational company to approach the small independent to develop the Ford BDA 1.6 L engine for the 2.0L class . The European Formula Two title was won in both 1971 and 1972 with Hart-built Ford engines , and the 2.0 L BDA engine powered the majority of Ford 's 1970s rallying successes . With Ford 's withdrawal from F2 in the mid-1970s , Hart began to concentrate on building their own designs . The first engine to bear the Hart name alone was the twin-cam , four-cylinder Hart 420R F2 unit , which appeared in 1976 and powered race-winning cars until the end of the decade . In 1978 , the Toleman team agreed to a partnership program , with Toleman providing finance to develop further Hart engine designs . The fruits of this collaboration resulted in Toleman taking a one-two finish in the 1980 European F2 Championship .",
  "/wiki/Inline-four_engine": "The inline-four engine or straight-four engine is a type of inline ( straight ) internal combustion four-cylinder engine with all four cylinders mounted in a straight line , or plane along the crankcase . The single bank of cylinders may be oriented in either a vertical or an inclined plane with all the pistons driving a common crankshaft . Where it is inclined , it is sometimes called a slant-four . In a specification chart or when an abbreviation is used , an inline-four engine is listed either as I4 or L4 ( for longitudinal , to avoid confusion between the digit 1 and the letter I ) . The inline-four layout is in perfect primary balance and confers a degree of mechanical simplicity which makes it popular for economy cars . However , despite its simplicity , it suffers from a secondary imbalance which causes minor vibrations in smaller engines . These vibrations become more powerful as engine size and power increase , so the more powerful engines used in larger cars generally are more complex designs with more than four cylinders . Today almost all manufacturers of four-cylinder engines for automobiles produce the inline-four layout , with Subaru and Porsche 718 flat-four engines being notable exceptions , and so four-cylinder is usually synonymous with and a more widely used term than inline-four . The inline-four is the most common engine configuration in modern cars , while the V6 engine is the second most popular . In the late 2000s ( decade ) , due to stringent government regulations mandating reduced vehicle emissions and increased fuel efficiency , the proportion of new vehicles sold in the U.S. with four-cylinder engines ( largely of the inline-four type ) rose from 30 percent to 47 percent between 2005 and 2008 , particularly in mid-size vehicles where a decreasing number of buyers have chosen the V6 performance option .",
