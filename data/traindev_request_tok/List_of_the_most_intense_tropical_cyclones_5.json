  "/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales": "Tropical cyclones are ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales , according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin ( s ) they are located in . Only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones , but some alternative scales also exist , such as accumulated cyclone energy , the Power Dissipation Index , the Integrated Kinetic Energy Index , and the Hurricane Severity Index . Tropical cyclones that develop in the Northern Hemisphere are unofficially classified by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales . Tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist within the North Atlantic Ocean or the North-eastern Pacific Ocean are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms . Should a system intensify further and become a hurricane , then it will be classified on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale , which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period . In the Western Pacific , the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin , which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period . The India Meteorological Department 's scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the North Indian Ocean , and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds . Tropical cyclones that develop in the Southern Hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on one of two scales , which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds : The Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale is used to classify systems within the Australian or South Pacific tropical cyclone basin . The scale used to classify systems in the South-West Indian Ocean is defined by Meteo France for use in various French territories , including New Caledonia and French Polynesia . The definition of sustained winds recommended by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute average at a height of 10 m ( 33 ft ) . However , the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period , at 10 m ( 33 ft ) above the surface . The scale used by RSMC New Delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period , and the Australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval .",
  "/wiki/Cyclone_Mahina": "Cyclone Mahina was the deadliest cyclone in recorded Australian history , and also likely the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere . Mahina struck Bathurst Bay , Cape York Peninsula , Queensland , on 4 March 1899 , and its winds and enormous storm surge combined to kill more than 300 people . While the Australian Bureau of Meteorology , which is the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center of the basin , estimates Mahina 's peak central pressure to be 914 hPa ( 26.99 inHg ) , the World Meteorological Organization is currently considering an application from Queensland scientists and researchers to have this value upgraded to 880 hPa ( 25.99 inHg ) , based on data from post-storm analysis . This would officially make Mahina the most intense cyclone recorded to have hit the Australian mainland , and the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere , a title currently held by Cyclone Winston . Cyclone Mahina also produced the largest storm surge on record , generating a 13-metre ( 43-foot ) -high surge .",

Forming out of a tropical low on 30 November 1975 , Joan gradually intensified as it tracked towards the west . After attaining Category 5 intensity on 5 December , the storm abruptly began to track southward and accelerated . The following day , the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 215 km/h ( 130 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 915 hPa ( 27.02 inHg ) . Joan only weakened slightly before making landfall in the vicinity of Mundabullagana . The cyclone rapidly weakened after landfall before dissipating over Western Australia on 12 December . Although no fatalities resulted from Joan , the cyclone caused widespread destruction across areas of Western Australia . In Port Hedland , most of the structures were damaged as a result of the storm . In addition , 1,000 homes in the town were damaged or destroyed . Further inland , record rainfall caused widespread flooding in many areas , causing many rivers and streams to overflow . Due to the severity of the storm , the name Joan was retired after the season .",

  "/wiki/Cyclone_Kathy": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Kathy was a powerful tropical cyclone that devastated the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands in March 1984 . Originating from a tropical low off the southern coast of Papua New Guinea . Tracking westward , the system attained gale-force winds by 18 March before striking the Cape York Peninsula . After crossing the area , Kathy entered the Gulf of Carpentaria where environmental conditions favoured significant development . On 22 March , the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone ( Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale ) with ten-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h ( 125 mph ) . By this time , the storm had been tracking towards the southwest and struck the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands later on 22 March before moving over the Australian mainland as a slightly weaker system . Once over land , Kathy rapidly degraded , losing gale-force winds within 24 hours ; the storm dissipated over the Northern Territory on 24 March . Moving through the Pellew Islands as a powerful cyclone , Kathy generated a maximum storm surge of 4.2 m ( 14 ft ) and winds exceeding 232 km/h ( 144 mph ) . Offshore , 20 vessels were affected , one of which sank and resulted in the death of its captain . In mainland Australia , the system struck a relatively sparsely populated area , with only Borroloola being significantly impacted by the cyclone . Additionally , mangroves at along the McArthur River sustained substantial damage . Overall , losses from the storm were placed at A $ 12 million ( A $ 30.5 million 2011 AUD ; US $ 24.1 million 2011 USD ) .",

  "/wiki/Cyclone_Rewa": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Rewa affected six countries and caused 22 deaths on its 28-day journey across the South Pacific Ocean in December 1993 and January 1994 . Cyclone Rewa developed from a tropical disturbance on 28 December south of Nauru . After forming , Rewa moved southwest through the Solomon Islands , crossing the 160th meridian east from the South Pacific basin into the Australian region . The cyclone began to strengthen steadily and turned southward , paralleling the eastern Australian coast through 31 December . Rewa reached its initial peak intensity as a Category 4 tropical cyclone on 2 January . It maintained this intensity for about 12 hours before an increase in wind shear induced its weakening by 3 January . The cyclone turned southeastward and moved back into the South Pacific basin on 4 January , before it passed over New Caledonia between 5-6 January . After affecting New Caledonia , Rewa weakened to a tropical depression and turned northwestward before re-entering the Australian basin on 10 January . Over the following days , the cyclone showed signs of restrengthening and executed an elongated cyclonic loop to the southeast of Papua New Guinea . Rewa subsequently entered a phase of quick intensification while proceeding southeastward , peaking in intensity as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone . It recurved toward the southwest while gradually weakening for several days . Although forecasters had predicted Rewa to make landfall near Mackay , Queensland , the cyclone began interacting with an upper-level trough on 18 January , causing it to divert to the southeast and move along the Queensland coast .",

Forming out of a tropical disturbance over the Arafura Sea on 2 April 1999 , the precursor to Gwenda tracked slowly westward and gradually became more organised . On 4 April , the system developed into a Category 1 cyclone and was named Gwenda . It began to undergo explosive intensification the following day , and in a 30-hour span ending early on 7 April , the storm 's maximum 10-minute sustained wind speed increased from 75 km/h ( 45 mph ) to 225 km/h ( 140 mph ) and its barometric pressure decreased to 900 hPa ( mbar ) . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that the storm had peaked as a high-end Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale . Increasing wind shear and an acceleration in forward speed caused Gwenda to quickly weaken . Less than 18 hours after peaking , the storm made landfall roughly 45 km ( 28 mi ) east of Port Hedland , Western Australia with winds of 100 km/h ( 65 mph ) . After moving ashore , Gwenda abruptly stalled before dissipating on 8 April . Although it was once an extremely intense cyclone , the factors that caused its deterioration also prevented significant damage . Rainfall from the storm peaked at 205 mm ( 8.1 in ) . Minor structural damage was reported , and only localised flooding was recorded . Following its usage , the name Gwenda was retired at the end of the season .",
  "/wiki/Cyclone_John": "Severe Tropical Cyclone John was an intense tropical cyclone that rapidly deepened offshore before devastating areas of Western Australia . The system was the second cyclone and first severe tropical cyclone of the active 1999-00 Australian region cyclone season . Cyclone John developed from a monsoon trough positioned northwest of Australia on 9 December 1999 . As it moved to the west and later south as the result of a subtropical ridge under favourable conditions , the cyclone was able to rapidly intensify . John reached peak intensity on 14 December as a Category 5 cyclone on the Australian cyclone scale , the highest rating possible . Cyclone John later began interacting with a mid-latitude trough , which slightly weakened the cyclone prior to making landfall near Whim Creek early on 15 December . Increasingly unfavourable conditions further inland resulted in the cyclone 's rapid weakening , before it dissipated during the next day . Cyclone John extensively affected areas of Western Australia , but damage was not as bad as expected . Widespread power outages across the Pilbara region were caused by John . Strong winds caused minor damage to infrastructure across the coast , as well as tree damage . 140 windmills were destroyed by the cyclone on the coast .
