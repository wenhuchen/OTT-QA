With an estimated population of 2,705,994 ( 2018 ) , it is also the most populous city in the Midwestern United States . Chicago is the county seat of Cook County , the second-most-populous county in the US , with a small portion of the northwest side of the city extending into DuPage County near O'Hare Airport . Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area , often referred to as Chicagoland . At nearly 10 million people , the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States . Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan , Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century . After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone . Depending on the particular year , the city 's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the world 's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council International .",

  "/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency": "The Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States , tasked with gathering , processing , and analyzing national security information from around the world , primarily through the use of human intelligence ( HUMINT ) . As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community ( IC ) , the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States . Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , which is a domestic security service , the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering , with only limited domestic intelligence collection . Though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the United States specializing in HUMINT , the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community . Moreover , the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President . It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions , such as the Special Activities Center . The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries , such as Germany 's BND . Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 , the CIA Director concurrently served as the head of the Intelligence Community ; today , the CIA is organized under the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) . Despite transferring some of its powers to the DNI , the CIA has grown in size as a result of the September 11 attacks . In 2013 , The Washington Post reported that in the fiscal year 2010 , the CIA had the largest budget of all IC agencies , exceeding previous estimates . The CIA has increasingly expanded its role , including covert paramilitary operations . One of its largest divisions , the Information Operations Center ( IOC ) , has shifted focus from counter-terrorism to offensive cyber-operations .",
  "/wiki/Black_Operation": "A black operation or black op is a covert or clandestine operation by a government agency , a military unit or a paramilitary organization ; it can include activities by private companies or groups . Key features of a black operation are that it is secret and it is not attributable to the organization carrying it out . A single such activity may be called a black bag operation ; that term is primarily used for covert or clandestine surreptitious entries into structures to obtain information for human intelligence operations . Such operations are known to have been carried out by the FBI , CIA , Mossad , MI6 , ASIS , COMANF , DGSE , MSS , R & AW , DGFI , ISI , SVR , FSB and the intelligence services of other nations . The main difference between a black operation and one that is merely secret is that a black operation involves a significant degree of deception , to conceal who is behind it or to make it appear that some other entity is responsible ( false flag operations ) .",

  "/wiki/Mistress_(lover)": "A mistress is a relatively long-term female lover and companion who is not married to her partner , especially when her partner is married to someone else . Generally , the relationship is stable and at least semi-permanent , but the couple does not live together openly and the relationship is usually , but not always , secret . There is often also the implication that the mistress is sometimes kept - i.e . that her lover is contributing to her living expenses . A mistress is usually not considered a prostitute : while a mistress , if kept , may , in some sense , be exchanging sex for money , the principal difference is that a mistress has sex with fewer men and there is not so much of a direct quid pro quo between the money and the sex act . There is usually an emotional and possibly social relationship between a man and his mistress , whereas the relationship between a prostitute and their client is predominantly sexual . It is also important that the kept status follows the establishment of a relationship of indefinite term as opposed to the agreement on price and terms established prior to any activity with a prostitute . Historically the term has denoted a kept woman , who was maintained in a comfortable ( or even lavish ) lifestyle by a wealthy man so that she would be available for his sexual pleasure . Such a woman could move between the roles of a mistress and a courtesan depending on her situation and environment . In modern times the word mistress is used primarily to refer to the female lover of a man who is married to another woman ; in the case of an unmarried man , it is usual to speak of a girlfriend or partner . The term mistress was originally used as a neutral feminine counterpart to mister or master .",

Located at the heart of the Indochinese peninsula , Laos is bordered by Myanmar and China to the northwest , Vietnam to the east , Cambodia to the southeast and Thailand to the west and southwest . Present Laos traces historic and cultural identity to the kingdom of Lan Xang Hom Khao ( Kingdom of a Million Elephants Under the White Parasol ) , which existed from the mid-fourteenth century to early eighteenth century as one of the largest kingdoms in Southeast Asia . Due to its central geographical location in Southeast Asia , the kingdom became a hub for overland trade , turned wealthy economically and culturally . After a period of internal conflict , Lan Xang broke off into three separate kingdoms - Luang Phrabang , Vientiane , and Champasak . In 1893 , the three territories came under French protectorate and were united to form what is now known as Laos . It briefly gained independence in 1945 after Japanese occupation , but was recolonised by France until it won autonomy in 1949 . Laos became independent in 1953 , with a constitutional monarchy under Sisavang Vong . A post-independence civil war began , which saw the communist resistance , supported by the Soviet Union and North Vietnam , fight against the monarchy that later came under influence of military regimes supported by the United States . After the Vietnam War ended in 1975 , the communist Pathet Lao movement came to power , ending the civil war and establishing a one-party state . Laos was then dependent on military and economic aid from the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991 . In 2018 , the country had the fourth highest GDP ( PPP ) per capita in Southeast Asia , after Singapore , Malaysia , and Thailand .",

  "/wiki/Watergate_scandal": "The Watergate scandal was a major federal political scandal in the United States involving the administration of United States President Richard Nixon from 1972 to 1974 that resulted in the end of Nixon 's presidency . The scandal stemmed from the June 17 , 1972 , break-in of the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) headquarters at the Watergate Office Building in Washington , D.C. , by five men and the Nixon administration 's subsequent attempts to cover up its involvement in the crime . Soon after the perpetrators were arrested , the press and the Justice Department discovered a connection between cash found on them at the time and a slush fund used by the Nixon re-election campaign committee . Further investigations , along with revelations during subsequent trials of the burglars in January 1973 , led the House of Representatives to grant its Judiciary Committee additional investigation authority to probe into certain matters within its jurisdiction , and the Senate to create a special investigative committee to look into the scandal . The resultant Senate Watergate hearings commenced in May 1973 . Broadcast gavel-to-gavel nationwide , by PBS , the hearings aroused great public interest . Senators heard testimony that the president had approved plans to cover up administration involvement in the Watergate break-in , and learned of the existence of a voice-activated taping system in the Oval Office . Meanwhile , Nixon 's administration resisted its probes , which led to a constitutional crisis . Several major revelations and egregious presidential action against the investigation later in 1973 prompted the House to commence an impeachment process against Nixon in February 1974 . On July 24 , 1974 , while the impeachment process was under way , the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in United States v. Nixon that Nixon was obligated to release the Oval Office tapes to government investigators . The tapes revealed that Nixon had conspired to cover up activities that took place after the break-in and had attempted to use federal officials to deflect the investigation . Shortly thereafter , the Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against Nixon for obstruction of justice , abuse of power , and contempt of Congress and reported those articles to the House of Representatives .",

The Harvard Corporation , chartered in 1650 , is the governing body of Harvard . In its early years , Harvard College primarily trained Congregational and Unitarian clergy , although it has never been formally affiliated with any denomination . Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century , and by the 19th century , Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites .

  "/wiki/Illuminati": "The Illuminati ( plural of Latin illuminatus , enlightened ) is a name given to several groups , both real and fictitious . Historically , the name usually refers to the Bavarian Illuminati , an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on 1 May 1776 in Bavaria , today part of Germany . The society 's goals were to oppose superstition , obscurantism , religious influence over public life , and abuses of state power . The order of the day , they wrote in their general statutes , is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice , to control them without dominating them . The Illuminati - along with Freemasonry and other secret societies - were outlawed through edict by Charles Theodore , Elector of Bavaria with the encouragement of the Catholic Church , in 1784 , 1785 , 1787 , and 1790 . In the following several years , the group was vilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that they continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution . Many influential intellectuals and progressive politicians counted themselves as members , including Ferdinand of Brunswick and the diplomat Xavier von Zwack , who was the Order 's second-in-command . It attracted literary men such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder and the reigning Duke of Gotha and of Weimar . In subsequent use , Illuminati has referred to various organisations which have claimed or have been claimed to be connected to the original Bavarian Illuminati or similar secret societies , though these links have been unsubstantiated . These organisations have often been alleged to conspire to control world affairs , by masterminding events and planting agents in government and corporations , in order to gain political power and influence and to establish a New World Order .

  "/wiki/Computer_engineer": "Computer engineering ( CE ) is a branch of engineering that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software . Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering ( or electrical engineering ) , software design , and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering . Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing , from the design of individual microcontrollers , microprocessors , personal computers , and supercomputers , to circuit design . This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work but also how they integrate into the larger picture . Usual tasks involving computer engineers include writing software and firmware for embedded microcontrollers , designing VLSI chips , designing analog sensors , designing mixed signal circuit boards , and designing operating systems . Computer engineers are also suited for robotics research , which relies heavily on using digital systems to control and monitor electrical systems like motors , communications , and sensors . In many institutions of higher learning , computer engineering students are allowed to choose areas of in-depth study in their junior and senior year because the full breadth of knowledge used in the design and application of computers is beyond the scope of an undergraduate degree . Other institutions may require engineering students to complete one or two years of general engineering before declaring computer engineering as their primary focus .",

  "/wiki/Alien_invasion": "The alien invasion or space invasion is a common feature in science fiction stories and film , in which extraterrestrials invade the Earth either to exterminate and supplant human life , enslave it under an intense state , harvest people for food , steal the planet 's resources , or destroy the planet altogether . The invasion scenario has been used as an allegory for a protest against military hegemony and the societal ills of the time . H. G. Wells ' novel The War of the Worlds extended the invasion literature that was already common when science fiction was first emerging as a genre . Prospects of invasion tended to vary with the state of current affairs , and current perceptions of threat . Alien invasion was a common metaphor in United States science fiction during the Cold War , illustrating the fears of foreign ( e.g . Soviet Union ) occupation and nuclear devastation of the American people . Examples of these stories include the short story The Liberation of Earth ( 1950 ) by William Tenn and the film The Invasion of the Body Snatchers ( 1956 ) . In the invasion trope , fictional aliens contacting Earth tend to either observe ( sometimes using experiments ) or invade , rather than help the population of Earth acquire the capacity to participate in interplanetary affairs . There are some notable exceptions , such as the alien-initiated first-contact scenarios in The Day the Earth Stood Still ( 1951 ) , Star Trek : First Contact ( 1996 ) and Arrival ( 2016 ) .

  "/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States and its principal federal law enforcement agency . Operating under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Justice , the FBI is also a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence . A leading U.S. counter-terrorism , counterintelligence , and criminal investigative organization , the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes . Although many of the FBI 's functions are unique , its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and the Russian FSB . Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad , the FBI is primarily a domestic agency , maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States , and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation . At an FBI field office , a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence . Despite its domestic focus , the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint , operating 60 Legal Attache ( LEGAT ) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe . These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries . The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas , just as the CIA has a limited domestic function ; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies . The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation , the BOI or BI for short . Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in 1935 . The FBI headquarters is the J. Edgar Hoover Building , located in Washington , D.C .",
  "/wiki/Terrorism": "Terrorism is , in the broadest sense , the use of intentional violence for political or religious purposes . It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants ( mostly civilians and neutral military personnel ) . The terms terrorist and terrorism originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but gained mainstream popularity in the 1970s during the conflicts of Northern Ireland , the Basque Country and Palestine . The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington , D.C. in 2001 . There are different definitions of terrorism . Terrorism is a charged term . It is often used with the connotation of something that is morally wrong . Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups . Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives . These include right-wing and left-wing political organizations , nationalist groups , religious groups , revolutionaries and ruling governments . Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states . When terrorism is perpetrated by nation states , it is not considered terrorism by the state conducting it , making legality a largely grey-area issue .",

  "/wiki/Anarchism": "Anarchism is a radical political movement that is highly skeptical towards authority and rejects all forms of unjust hierarchy . It calls for the abolition of the state which it holds to be undesirable , unnecessary , and harmful . Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with stateless societies or other forms of free associations . Anarchism 's timeline stretches back to prehistory when people lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states , kingdoms or empires . With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies , skepticism towards authority also rose , but it was not until the 19th century a self-conscious political movement was formed . During the latest half of 19th and the first decades of 20th century , the anarchist movement flourished to most parts of the world , and had a significant role in worker 's struggles for emancipation . Various branches of anarchism were espoused during those times . Anarchists took part in several revolutions , most notably in the Spanish Civil War , where they were crushed by the fascists forces in 1939 , marking the end of the classical era of anarchism . In the latest decades of the 20th century , the anarchist movement nonetheless became relevant and vivid once more . Anarchism employ various tactics in order to meet their ideal ends ; these can be broadly separated in revolutionary and evolutionary tactics . There is significant overlap between the two legs which are merely descriptive . Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state , and have taken a violent turn in the past .",

  "/wiki/Contract_killing": "Contract killing is a form of murder in which one party hires another party ( often called a hitman ) to kill a target individual or group of people . It involves an illegal agreement between two or more parties in which one party agrees to kill the target in exchange for some form of payment , monetary or otherwise . Either party may be a person , group , or an organization . Contract killing has been associated with organized crime , government conspiracies , and vendettas . For example , in the United States , the gang Murder , Inc. committed hundreds of murders on behalf of the National Crime Syndicate during the 1930s and 1940s . Contract killing provides the hiring party with the advantage of not having to carry out the actual killing , making it more difficult for law enforcement to connect said party with the murder . The likelihood that authorities will establish that party 's guilt for the committed crime , especially due to lack of forensic evidence linked to the contracting party , makes the case more difficult to attribute to the hiring party .",

Nancy Allen stars as Sally Bedina , a young woman involved in the crime . The supporting cast includes John Lithgow and Dennis Franz . The film 's tagline in advertisements was , Murder has a sound all of its own . The film is directly based on Michelangelo Antonioni 's 1966 film Blowup , replacing the medium of photography with the medium of audio recording . The concept of Blow Out came to De Palma while he was working on the thriller Dressed to Kill ( 1980 ) . The film was shot in the late autumn and winter of 1980 in various Philadelphia locations on a relatively substantial budget of $ 18 million . Blow Out opened to minuscule audience interest at the time of release despite receiving a mostly positive critical reception . The lead performances by Travolta and Allen , the direction by DePalma and the visual style were cited as the strongest points of the film . Critics also recognised the stylistic and narrative connection to the work of Alfred Hitchcock , who DePalma admires , and giallo films . Over the years since its initial theatrical release , it has developed status as a cult film and received a home media release by the Criterion Collection , a company who specializes in important classic and contemporary film , which re-ignited public interest in the film .",

The accident was caused by Senator Edward M. ( Ted ) Kennedy 's negligence and resulted in the death of his 28-year-old passenger Mary Jo Kopechne , who was trapped inside the vehicle . Kennedy left a party on the island at 11:15 p.m. Friday , with Kopechne . He maintained his intent was to immediately take Kopechne to a ferry landing and return to Edgartown , but that he made a wrong turn onto a dirt road leading to a one-lane bridge . After his car skidded off the bridge into Poucha Pond , Kennedy swam free . He maintained he tried to rescue Kopechne from the submerged car , but could not . Her death could have happened any time between about 11:30 p.m. Friday and 1 a.m. Saturday , as an off-duty deputy sheriff maintained he saw a car matching Kennedy 's at 12:40 a.m. Kennedy left the scene and did not report the accident to police until after 10 a.m. Saturday . A diver recovered Kopechne 's body from the car shortly before 9 a.m. Saturday . At a July 25 , 1969 court hearing , Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and received a two-month suspended jail sentence . In a televised statement that same evening , he said his conduct immediately after the accident made no sense to me at all , and that he regarded his failure to report the accident immediately as indefensible . A January 5 , 1970 judicial inquest concluded Kennedy and Kopechne did not intend to take the ferry , and that Kennedy intentionally turned toward the bridge , operating his vehicle negligently , if not recklessly , at too high a rate of speed for the hazard which the bridge posed in the dark . The judge stopped short of recommending charges , and a grand jury convened on April 6 , 1970 , returning no indictments .",

  "/wiki/Mockumentary": "A mockumentary ( a portmanteau of mock and documentary ) or docucomedy is a type of movie or television show depicting fictional events but presented as a documentary . These productions are often used to analyze or comment on current events and issues by using a fictional setting , or to parody the documentary form itself . While mockumentaries are usually comedic , pseudo-documentaries are their dramatic equivalents . However , pseudo-documentary should not be confused with docudrama , a fictional genre in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events . Also , docudrama is different from docufiction ; a genre in which documentaries are contaminated with fictional elements . Mockumentaries are often presented as historical documentaries , with B roll and talking heads discussing past events , or as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pieces following people as they go through various events . Examples emerged during the 1950s when archival film footage became available . A very early example was a short piece on the Swiss Spaghetti Harvest that appeared as an April Fools ' prank on the British television program Panorama in 1957 . The term mockumentary , which originated in the 1960s , was popularized in the mid-1980s when This Is Spinal Tap director Rob Reiner used it in interviews to describe that film . Mockumentaries are often partly or wholly improvised , as an unscripted style of acting helps to maintain the pretense of reality . Comedic mockumentaries rarely have laugh tracks , also to sustain the atmosphere , although exceptions exist . Music is often employed to expose the ambiguities and fallacies of conventional storytelling ; for instance by pointing at the paradoxes of the distinction between diegetic and extradiegetic music .",
  "/wiki/Right-wing_politics": "Right-wing politics holds the view that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable , natural , normal , or desirable , typically supporting this position on the basis of natural law , economics , or tradition. : p . 693 , 721 Hierarchy and inequality may be viewed as natural results of traditional social differences or the competition in market economies . The term right-wing can generally refer to the conservative or reactionary section of a political party or system . The political terms Left and Right were first used during the French Revolution ( 1789-1799 ) and they originally referred to seating arrangements in the French parliament : those who sat to the right of the chair of the parliamentary president were broadly supportive of the institutions of the monarchist Old Regime . The original Right in France was formed as a reaction against the Left and comprised those politicians supporting hierarchy , tradition , and clericalism . :693 The use of the expression la droite ( the right ) became prominent in France after the restoration of the monarchy in 1815 , when it was applied to the Ultra-royalists . The people of English-speaking countries did not apply the terms right and left to their own politics until the 20th century . Although the term right-wing originated with traditional conservatives , monarchists , and reactionaries , the term extreme right-wing has been applied to movements including fascism , Nazism , and racial supremacy . From the 1830s to the 1880s , the Western world 's social class structure and economy shifted from nobility and aristocracy towards capitalism . This general economic shift towards capitalism affected centre-right movements such as the British Conservative Party , which responded by becoming supportive of capitalism . In the United States , the Right includes both economic and social conservatives . In Europe , economic conservatives are usually considered liberal and the Right includes nationalists , nativist opponents of immigration , religious conservatives , and , historically , a significant number of right-wing movements with anti-capitalist sentiments , including conservatives and fascists , opposed contemporary capitalism because they believed that selfishness and excessive materialism were inherent in it .",

Senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to the Khomeini government of the Islamic Republic of Iran , which was the subject of an arms embargo . The administration hoped to use the proceeds of the arms sale to fund the Contras in Nicaragua . Under the Boland Amendment , further funding of the Contras by the government had been prohibited by Congress . The official justification for the arms shipments was that they were part of an operation to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah , a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps . The plan was for Israel to ship weapons to Iran , for the United States to resupply Israel , and for Israel to pay the United States . The Iranian recipients promised to do everything in their power to achieve the release of the hostages . The first arms sales authorized to Iran were in 1981 , prior to the American hostages having been taken in Lebanon . The plan was later complicated in late 1985 , when Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council diverted a portion of the proceeds from the Iranian weapon sales to fund the Contras , a group of anti-Sandinista rebels , in their insurgency against the socialist government of Nicaragua . While President Ronald Reagan was a vocal supporter of the Contra cause , the evidence is disputed as to whether he personally authorized the diversion of funds to the Contras . Handwritten notes taken by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on 7 December 1985 indicate that Reagan was aware of potential hostage transfers with Iran , as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to moderate elements within that country . Weinberger wrote that Reagan said he could answer to charges of illegality but could n't answer to the charge that 'big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free the hostages . '",

  "/wiki/Amnesia": "Amnesia is a deficit in memory caused by brain damage or disease , but it can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs . The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused . There are two main types of amnesia : retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia . Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date , usually the date of an accident or operation . In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades , while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory . Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store into the long-term store . People with anterograde amnesia can not remember things for long periods of time . These two types are not mutually exclusive ; both can occur simultaneously . Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to the medial temporal lobe . In addition , specific areas of the hippocampus ( the CA1 region ) are involved with memory . Research has also shown that when areas of the diencephalon are damaged , amnesia can occur . Recent studies have shown a correlation between deficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss .",

Nazism is a form of fascism and showed that ideology 's disdain for liberal democracy and the parliamentary system , but also incorporated fervent antisemitism , anti-communism , scientific racism , and eugenics into its creed . Its extreme nationalism came from Pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist v\u00f6lkisch movement prominent in the German nationalism of the time , and it was strongly influenced by the Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany 's defeat in World War I , from which came the party 's cult of violence which was at the heart of the movement . Nazism subscribed to pseudo-scientific theories of racial hierarchy and Social Darwinism , identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race . It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a German homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people 's community ( Volksgemeinschaft ) . The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory , as well as gain additional lands for German expansion under the doctrine of Lebensraum and exclude those who they deemed either community aliens or inferior races . The term National Socialism arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of socialism , as an alternative to both Marxist international socialism and free market capitalism . Nazism rejected the Marxist concepts of class conflict and universal equality , opposed cosmopolitan internationalism , and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the common good , accepting political interests as the main priority of economic organization , which tended to match the general outlook of collectivism or communitarianism rather than economic socialism . The Nazi Party 's precursor , the Pan-German nationalist and antisemitic German Workers ' Party , was founded on 5 January 1919 . By the early 1920s the party was renamed the National Socialist German Workers ' Party - to attract workers away from left-wing parties such as the Social Democrats ( SPD ) and the Communists ( KPD ) - and Adolf Hitler assumed control of the organization . The National Socialist Program or 25 Points was adopted in 1920 and called for a united Greater Germany that would deny citizenship to Jews or those of Jewish descent , while also supporting land reform and the nationalization of some industries . In Mein Kampf ( My Struggle ; 1924-1925 ) , Hitler outlined the anti-Semitism and anti-Communism at the heart of his political philosophy , as well as his disdain for representative democracy and his belief in Germany 's right to territorial expansion .",

  "/wiki/Comedy": "In a modern sense , comedy ( from the Greek : \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 , k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda ) is a genre of fiction that refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter , especially in theatre , television , film , stand-up comedy , books and novels or any other medium of entertainment . The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece . In the Athenian democracy , the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters . The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict . Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a Society of Youth and a Society of the Old . A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes . In this struggle , the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority , and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter . Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt , thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor . Parody subverts popular genres and forms , critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them . Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy , which derives its humor largely from bizarre , surprising ( and improbable ) situations or characters , and black comedy , which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature . Similarly scatological humor , sexual humor , and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways . A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society ( usually upper-class society ) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members .",

The most notable claim is that the six crewed landings ( 1969-1972 ) were faked and that twelve Apollo astronauts did not actually walk on the Moon . Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened , by manufacturing , tampering with , or destroying evidence including photos , telemetry tapes , radio and TV transmissions , and Moon rock samples . Much third-party evidence for the landings exists , and detailed rebuttals to the hoax claims have been made . Since the late 2000s , high-definition photos taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) of the Apollo landing sites have captured the lander modules and the tracks left by the astronauts . In 2012 , images were released showing five of the six Apollo missions ' American flags erected on the Moon still standing ; the exception is that of Apollo 11 , which has lain on the lunar surface since being accidentally blown over by the takeoff rocket 's exhaust .

Opinion polls taken in various locations have shown that between 6% and 20% of Americans , 25% of Britons , and 28% of Russians surveyed believe that the crewed landings were faked .

Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south ; [ b ] Iran to the west ; Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Tajikistan to the north ; and China to the northeast . Occupying 652,000 square kilometers ( 252,000 sq mi ) , it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest . Kabul is the capital and largest city . The population is 32 million , mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns , Tajiks , Hazaras and Uzbeks . Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era , and the country 's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia . The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by Alexander the Great , Mauryas , Muslim Arabs , Mongols , British , Soviets , and by the United States with allied countries . The land also served as the source from which the Kushans , Hephthalites , Samanids , Saffarids , Ghaznavids , Ghorids , Khaljis , Mughals , Hotaks , Durranis , and others have risen to form major empires . The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century . In the late 19th century , Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between British India and the Russian Empire . Its border with British India , the Durand Line , was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter 's independence in 1947 . Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence , eventually becoming a monarchy under Amanullah Khan , until almost 50 years later when Zahir Shah was overthrown and a republic was established .",
