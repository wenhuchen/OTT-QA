Del incurred Corinne 's wrath by ruining her wedding day food after his fridge broke down , leaving the guests eating pie and chips and Corinne and Denzil cutting not a wedding cake but a jam sponge . The final straw came when Denzil hired Del , Rodney and Grandad to paint the living room . They burnt a hole through the kettle , ruined the kitchen with the steam , turning it into a Turkish bath , and thought they had killed Corinne 's canary . Panicking , they sent Grandad to buy a replacement bird , hoping to fool Corinne .

Denzil and Corinne divorced later in the series , but Corinne herself only appeared in one episode .
