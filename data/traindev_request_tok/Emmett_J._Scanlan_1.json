Paul is generally considered one of the most important figures of the Apostolic Age and from the mid-30s to the mid-50s AD he founded several Christian communities in Asia Minor and Europe . He took advantage of his status as both a Jew and a Roman citizen to minister to both Jewish and Roman audiences . According to the New Testament book Acts of the Apostles ( often simply called Acts ) , Paul persecuted some of the early disciples of Jesus , possibly Hellenised diaspora Jews converted to Christianity , in the area of Jerusalem prior to his conversion . [ note 1 ] In the narrative of Acts , Paul was traveling on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus on a mission to arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem when the resurrected Jesus appeared to him in a great light . He was struck blind , but after three days his sight was restored by Ananias of Damascus and Paul began to preach that Jesus of Nazareth is the Jewish Messiah and the Son of God . [ Acts 9:20-9:21 ] Approximately half of the book of Acts deals with Paul 's life and works . Thirteen of the twenty-seven books in the New Testament have traditionally been attributed to Paul . Seven of the Pauline epistles are undisputed by scholars as being authentic , with varying degrees of argument about the remainder . Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews is not asserted in the Epistle itself and was already doubted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries . [ note 2 ] It was almost unquestioningly accepted from the 5th to the 16th centuries that Paul was the author of Hebrews , but that view is now almost universally rejected by scholars .
