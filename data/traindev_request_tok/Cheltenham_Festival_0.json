  "/wiki/Hurdling_(horse_race)": "A hurdle race in Great Britain and Ireland is a National Hunt horse race where the horses jump over obstacles called hurdles that are over three and a half feet high . They are typically made of a series of panels made of brush and are flexible . Hurdle races always have a minimum of eight hurdles and a minimum distance of two miles ( 3 km ) . National Hunt horses that have the size and scope to jump higher than the height of a hurdle use these types of races in order to gain experience of jumping obstacles so they can later be sent to jump bigger obstacles called fences . Hurdle races tend to be run at a faster pace than Chases as the height of the hurdle is much lower than a chasing fence . The best hurdlers have a low and efficient style of jumping , which means they do not lose much momentum when they run over or hurdle a hurdle . Australian hurdle races are now conducted over wooden fences which provide some flexibility when ran over or hurdled . In Victoria , these runs consist of portable hurdles in which the natural brush has been replaced by bright yellow soft synthetic brush . Hurdle races are usually run over a minimal distance of 2 800 metres . Victoria and South Australia are the only two states in Australia that conduct jumping races .",

  "/wiki/Steeplechase_(horse_racing)": "A steeplechase is a distance horse race in which competitors are required to jump diverse fence and ditch obstacles . Steeplechasing is primarily conducted in Ireland ( where it originated ) , the United Kingdom , Canada , United States , Australia and France . The name is derived from early races in which orientation of the course was by reference to a church steeple , jumping fences and ditches and generally traversing the many intervening obstacles in the countryside . Modern usage of the term steeplechase differs between countries . In Ireland and the United Kingdom , it refers only to races run over large , fixed obstacles , in contrast to hurdle races where the obstacles are much smaller . The collective term jump racing or National Hunt racing is used when referring to steeplechases and hurdle races collectively ( although , properly speaking , National Hunt racing also includes some flat races ) . Elsewhere in the world , steeplechase is used to refer to any race that involves jumping obstacles . The most famous steeplechase in the world is the Grand National run annually at Aintree Racecourse , in Liverpool , since its inception in 1836 ( the official race was held three years later ) , which in 2014 offered a prize fund of \u00a31 million .",
