  "/wiki/In_the_Skin_of_a_Lion": "In the Skin of a Lion is a novel by Canadian-Sri Lankan writer Michael Ondaatje . It was first published in 1987 by McClelland and Stewart . The novel fictionalizes the lives of the immigrants who played a large role in the building of the city of Toronto in the early 1900s , but whose contributions never became part of the city 's official history . Ondaatje illuminates the investment of these settlers in Canada , through their labour , while they remain outsiders to mainstream society . In the Skin of a Lion is thus an expos\u00e9 of the migrant condition : It is a novel about the wearing and the removal of masks ; the shedding of skin , the transformations and translations of identity . An important aspect of the novel is its depiction of Toronto in the 1930s . Ondaatje spent many months in the archives of the City of Toronto and newspapers of the era . Prominence is given to the construction of two Toronto landmarks , the Prince Edward Viaduct , commonly known as the Bloor Street Viaduct , and the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant , and focuses on the lives of the immigrant workers . The plot incorporates a number of true stories of the time , such as the fall of a nun from a bridge , the disappearance of Ambrose Small , the political suppression of Police Chief Draper , and the murder of labour union organizers Rosvall and Voutilainen . In a minor section of the novel , Patrick Lewis visits Paris , Ontario in which Ondaatje describes various parts of the town including : Broadway Street , Wheelers Needleworks , Medusa , Paris Plains , just north of the town , the Arlington hotel , and Paris Public Library . The novel 's title is taken from a line in The Epic of Gilgamesh , following the death of Enkidu . It is located in the epigraph as I will let my hair grow long for your sake , I will wander through the wilderness in the skin of a lion , echoing the theme of converging voices re-telling history .",

  "/wiki/Richard_Francis_Burton": "Sir Richard Francis Burton KCMG FRGS ( /\u02c8b\u025c\u02d0rt\u0259n/ ; 19 March 1821 - 20 October 1890 ) was a British explorer , geographer , translator , writer , soldier , orientalist , cartographer , ethnologist , spy , linguist , poet , fencer and diplomat . He was famed for his travels and explorations in Asia , Africa and the Americas , as well as his extraordinary knowledge of languages and cultures . According to one count , he spoke 29 European , Asian and African languages . Burton 's best-known achievements include : a well-documented journey to Mecca in disguise , at a time when Europeans were forbidden access on pain of death ; an unexpurgated translation of One Thousand and One Nights ( commonly called The Arabian Nights in English after early translations of Antoine Galland 's French version ) ; the publication of the Kama Sutra in English ; a translation of The Perfumed Garden , the Arab Kama Sutra ; and a journey with John Hanning Speke as the first Europeans to visit the Great Lakes of Africa in search of the source of the Nile . His works and letters extensively criticised colonial policies of the British Empire , even to the detriment of his career . Although he aborted his university studies , he became a prolific and erudite author and wrote numerous books and scholarly articles about subjects including human behaviour , travel , falconry , fencing , sexual practices and ethnography . A characteristic feature of his books is the copious footnotes and appendices containing remarkable observations and information . William Henry Wilkins wrote : So far as I can gather from all I have learned , the chief value of Burtons version of The Scented Garden lay not so much in his translation of the text , though that of course was admirably done , as in the copious notes and explanations which he had gathered together for the purpose of annotating the book . He had made this subject a study of years . For the notes of the book alone he had been collecting material for thirty years , though his actual translation of it only took him eighteen months . Burton was a captain in the army of the East India Company , serving in India , and later briefly in the Crimean War . Following this , he was engaged by the Royal Geographical Society to explore the east coast of Africa , where he led an expedition guided by locals and was the first European known to have seen Lake Tanganyika .",
