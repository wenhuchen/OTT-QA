There are records of this family in that area from as far back as 1271 . Life was difficult for the humble classes of people in those times , and in Serrastretta , things were so bad that a small group opted to leave . Upon hearing that Francesco seemed to be a very just landowner and offered what seemed to be a good deal to the peasants who settled there , a small group of colonists walked about 48 to 80 kilometres ( 30 to 50 mi ) over rough terrain to start new lives on Francesco 's property . After having a fine palace built for himself , he had his workmen build narrow little shacks for the workers to occupy , in full view of his palace . He developed a co-operative system where people could work patches of land , and have to pay him a fee at the end of the year . He encouraged them to plant trees and gardens to feed their families , as the land was good and there was a stream that ran through the area all year round . The original settlers were all from Serrastretta :",
