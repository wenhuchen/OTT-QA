  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",
  "/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy": "The Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) is the naval branch of the Australian Defence Force . Following the Federation of Australia in 1901 , the ships and resources of the separate colonial navies were integrated into a national force , called the Commonwealth Naval Forces . Originally intended for local defence , the navy was granted the title of 'Royal Australian Navy ' in 1911 , and became increasingly responsible for defence of the region . Britain 's Royal Navys Australian Squadron was assigned to the Australia Station and provided support to the RAN . The Australian and New Zealand governments helped to fund the Australian Squadron until 1913 , while the Admiralty committed itself to keeping the Squadron at a constant strength . The Australian Squadron ceased on 4 October 1913 , when RAN ships entered Sydney Harbour for the first time . The Royal Navy continued to provide blue-water defence capability in the Pacific up to the early years of the Second World War . Then , rapid wartime expansion saw the acquisition of large surface vessels and the building of many smaller warships . In the decade following the war , the RAN acquired a small number of aircraft carriers , the last of which was decommissioned in 1982 . Today , the RAN consists of 48 commissioned vessels , 3 non-commissioned vessels and over 16,000 personnel . The navy is one of the largest and most sophisticated naval forces in the South Pacific region , with a significant presence in the Indian Ocean and worldwide operations in support of military campaigns and peacekeeping missions . The current Chief of Navy is Vice Admiral Michael Noonan .",

At 8.5 million square kilometers ( 3.2 million square miles ) and with over 211 million people , Brazil is the world 's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous . Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro . In 1815 , the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves .",

The Brazilian Navy is the largest navy in South America and in Latin America , and the second largest navy in the Americas , after the United States Navy . The navy was involved in Brazil 's war of independence from Portugal . Most of Portugal 's naval forces and bases in South America were transferred to the newly independent country . In the initial decades following independence , the country maintained a large naval force and the navy was later involved in the Cisplatine War , the River Plate conflicts , the Paraguayan War as well as other sporadic rebellions that marked Brazilian history . By the 1880s the Brazilian Imperial Navy was the most powerful in South America . After the 1893 naval rebellion , there was a hiatus in the development of the navy until 1905 , when Brazil acquired two of the most powerful and advanced dreadnoughts of the day which sparked a dreadnought race with Brazil 's South American neighbours . The Brazilian Navy participated in both World War I and World War II , engaging in anti-submarine patrols in the Atlantic . The modern Brazilian Navy includes British-built guided missile frigates ( FFG ) , locally built corvettes ( FFL ) , coastal diesel-electric submarines ( SSK ) and many other river and coastal patrol craft .",

[ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

The PLAN can trace its lineage to naval units fighting during the Chinese Civil War and was established in September 1950 . Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s , the Soviet Union provided assistance to the PLAN in the form of naval advisers and export of equipment and technology . Until the late 1980s , the PLAN was largely a riverine and littoral force ( brown-water navy ) . However , by the 1990s , following the fall of the Soviet Union and a shift towards a more forward-oriented foreign and security policy , the leaders of the Chinese military were freed from worrying over land border disputes , and instead turned their attention towards the seas . This led to the development of the People 's Liberation Army Navy into a green-water navy by 2009 . Before the 1990s the PLAN had traditionally played a subordinate role to the People 's Liberation Army Ground Force . In 2008 , General Qian Lihua confirmed that China plans to operate a small fleet of aircraft carriers in the near future , but for the purpose of regional defence as opposed to global reach . As of 2013 PLA officials have also outlined plans to operate in the first and second island chains . Chinese strategists term the development of the PLAN from a green-water navy into a regional blue-water defensive and offensive navy . The People 's Liberation Army Navy is composed of five branches ; the Submarine Force , the Surface Force , the Coastal Defense Force , the Marine Corps and the Naval Air Force . With a personnel strength of 255,000 servicemen and women , including 10,000 marines and 26,000 naval air force personnel , it is the second largest navy in the world in terms of tonnage , only behind the United States Navy , and has the largest number of major combatants of any navy .",

Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin .

  "/wiki/Spanish_Navy": "The Spanish Navy ( Spanish : Armada Espa\u00f1ola ) is the maritime branch of the Spanish Armed Forces and one of the oldest active naval forces in the world . The Spanish navy was responsible for a number of major historic achievements in navigation , the most famous being the discovery of America by Spain and the first global circumnavigation by Magellan and Elcano . For several centuries , it played a crucial logistical role in the Spanish Empire and defended a vast trade network across the Atlantic Ocean between the Americas and Europe and across the Pacific Ocean between Asia and the Americas . The Spanish Navy was the most powerful maritime force in the world in the 16th and 17th centuries and possibly the world 's largest navy at the end of the 16th century and in the early 17th century [ vague ] . Reform under the Bourbon dynasty improved its logistical and military capacity in the 18th century , for most of which Spain possessed the world 's third largest navy . In the 19th century , the Spanish Navy built and operated one of the first military submarines , made important contributions in the development of destroyer warships , and again achieved a first global circumnavigation , this time by an ironclad vessel . Today the Spanish Navy is one of the most important in the world , and one of the only nine naval forces on the planet capable of projecting an important level of force in their own hemisphere The main bases of the Spanish Navy are located in Rota , Ferrol , San Fernando and Cartagena .",
