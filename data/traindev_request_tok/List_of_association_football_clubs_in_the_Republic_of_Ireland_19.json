  "/wiki/Inchigeelagh": "Inchigeelagh ( Gaeilge : Inse Geimhleach , meaning Island of the Prisoner or hostages ) is a small village , townland and civil parish in County Cork , Ireland . The village is just outside a Gaeltacht area . The River Lee passes through the village . The nearby 'pater noster ' string of lakes collectively known as Lough Allua were once popular with anglers and are now fished for large pike , perch and some brown trout . The decline of fishing has coincided with the loss of salmon on the River Lee following the erection of the Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra hydroelectric dams down-river between 1952 and 1957 . This led to the subsequent decline in the fortunes of the village as a location for angling . [ citation needed ] A hotel was built in 1810 to serve the horse-drawn coaches of tourists travelling the Prince of Wales route to Kenmare and Killarney . It operated as The Lake Hotel ( though it never had a view of the lake ) until it closed in 2014 . Another hotel was built across the street as Corcoran 's Hotel but it became Creedon 's Hotel and is now run by the fourth generation of the Creedon family . [ citation needed ] Recent efforts have been made to campaign for works to be done on the two dams that prevent salmon from accessing the Lee river 's upper reaches and a documentary called River Runner has publicised the issues of the river . Inchigeelagh was the meeting place for the Lyre Company Irish Volunteers , in April 1916 , from where they intended to collect some of the rifles sent by Roger Casement on board the ship Aud for use in the 1916 Easter Rising . However , the ship was arrested by the British Navy before it could deliver the arms .",
