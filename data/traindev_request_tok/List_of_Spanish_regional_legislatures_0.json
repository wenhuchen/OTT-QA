It is the most populous , and the second largest autonomous community in the country . The Andalusian autonomous community is officially recognised as a historical nationality . The territory is divided into eight provinces : Almer\u00eda , C\u00e1diz , C\u00f3rdoba , Granada , Huelva , Ja\u00e9n , M\u00e1laga and Seville . Its capital is the city of Seville . Andalusia is located in the south of the Iberian peninsula , in southwestern Europe , immediately south of the autonomous communities of Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha ; west of the autonomous community of Murcia and the Mediterranean Sea ; east of Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean ; and north of the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar . Andalusia is the only European region with both Mediterranean and Atlantic coastlines . The small British overseas territory of Gibraltar shares a three-quarter-mile land border with the Andalusian province of C\u00e1diz at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar . The main mountain ranges of Andalusia are the Sierra Morena and the Baetic System , consisting of the Subbaetic and Penibaetic Mountains , separated by the Intrabaetic Basin . In the north , the Sierra Morena separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile-La Mancha on Spain 's Meseta Central . To the south the geographic subregion of Upper Andalusia lies mostly within the Baetic System , while Lower Andalusia is in the Baetic Depression of the valley of the Guadalquivir . The name Andalusia is derived from the Arabic word Al-Andalus ( \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633 ) .",

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",

It is situated on the lower reaches of the River Guadalquivir , in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula . Seville has a municipal population of about 690,000 as of 2016 [ update ] , and a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million , making it the largest city in Andalusia , the fourth-largest city in Spain and the 30th most populous municipality in the European Union . Its old town , with an area of 4 square kilometres ( 2 sq mi ) , contains three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the Alc\u00e1zar palace complex , the Cathedral and the General Archive of the Indies . The Seville harbour , located about 80 kilometres ( 50 miles ) from the Atlantic Ocean , is the only river port in Spain [ citation needed ] . Seville experiences high temperatures in the Summer , with daily maximums routinely above 35 \u00b0C ( 95 \u00b0F ) in July and August . Seville was founded as the Roman city of Hispalis . It became known as Ishbiliyya after the Muslim conquest in 712 . During the Muslim rule in Spain , Seville came under the jurisdiction of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba before becoming the independent Taifa of Seville ; later it was ruled by the Muslim Almoravids and the Almohads until finally being incorporated into the Christian Kingdom of Castile under Ferdinand III in 1248 . After the discovery of the Americas , Seville became one of the economic centres of the Spanish Empire as its port monopolised the trans-oceanic trade and the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n ( House of Trade ) wielded its power , opening a Golden Age of arts and literature . In 1519 , Ferdinand Magellan departed from Seville for the first circumnavigation of the Earth . Coinciding with the Baroque period of European history , the 17th century in Seville represented the most brilliant flowering of the city 's culture ; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as silting in the Guadalquivir forced the trade monopoly to relocate to the nearby port of C\u00e1diz .",

Founded in Catalonia in 2006 , the party received 25.4% of votes and 36 deputies in the December 2017 Catalan regional election , making it the largest single party in the Parliament of Catalonia . Nevertheless , it has never taken power so its actual political stance remains a source of debate between supporters and adversaries , beyond a strong opposition to Catalan nationalism and the Catalan independence movement . The party used the phrase Catalonia is my homeland , Spain is my country and Europe is our future to outline the ideology which the party self-describes as postnationalist . In spite of that , it has been deemed by a variety of sources to profess a populist Spanish nationalist ideology . Citizens used to present itself as a centre-left party that offered a mix of social-democratic and liberal-progressive positions on its platform , but it dropped any mention to social democracy from its principles in February 2017 and by 2018 was judged by some to have experienced a further swing to the right , as it began to compete with the PP , and later also with Vox , to become the leading right-of-centre party in the country .

  "/wiki/Basque_language": "Basque ( /b\u00e6sk , b\u0251\u02d0sk/ ; euskara [ eus\u033a\u02c8ka\u027ea ] ) is a language spoken in the Basque Country , a region that straddles the westernmost Pyrenees in adjacent parts of northern Spain and southwestern France . Linguistically , Basque is unrelated to the other languages of Europe and is a language isolate in relation to any other known living language . The Basques are indigenous to , and primarily inhabit , the Basque Country . The Basque language is spoken by 28.4% ( 751,500 ) of Basques in all territories . Of these , 93.2% ( 700,300 ) are in the Spanish area of the Basque Country and the remaining 6.8% ( 51,200 ) are in the French portion . Native speakers live in a contiguous area that includes parts of four Spanish provinces and the three ancient provinces in France . Gipuzkoa , most of Biscay , a few municipalities of \u00c1lava , and the northern area of Navarre formed the core of the remaining Basque-speaking area before measures were introduced in the 1980s to strengthen the language . By contrast , most of \u00c1lava , the western part of Biscay and central and southern areas of Navarre are predominantly populated by native speakers of Spanish , either because Basque was replaced by Spanish over the centuries , in some areas ( most of \u00c1lava and central Navarre ) , or because it was possibly never spoken there , in other areas ( parts of the Enkarterri and southeastern Navarre ) . In Francoist Spain , Basque language use was affected by the repressive policies . In the Basque Country , Francoist repression was not only political , but also linguistic and cultural . The regime placed legal restrictions on the use of language , which was suppressed from official discourse , education , and publishing , making it illegal to register new-born babies under Basque names , and even requiring tombstone engravings in Basque to be removed . In some provinces , the public use of the language was suppressed , with people fined for speaking Basque .",

All 75 seats in the Parliament were up for election . The election was held simultaneously with a regional election in Galicia . Lehendakari I\u00f1igo Urkullu announced that the election would be held one month ahead of schedule , on 25 September 2016 , based on the climate of ungovernability affecting national politics as a result of the ongoing Spanish government formation negotiations , intending to move the regional election as far away as possible from a possible new general election . This prompted Galician president Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o to hold the Galician regional election in the same date . Urkullu 's Basque Nationalist Party ( PNV ) emerged as the largest political force in the region with an increased plurality , but required from the support of other parties to govern . This was to be provided by the Socialist Party of the Basque Country-Basque Country Left ( PSE-EE ) , which despite scoring the worst result in its history after seeing its support almost halved - falling from 18.9% and 16 seats to 11.9% and 9 seats - would went on to form a coalition minority government with the PNV . EH Bildu was able to hold onto second place , albeit with a reduced support by going down from 21 to 17 seats , whereas the Elkarrekin Podemos alliance scored third , but below campaign expectations . The People 's Party ( PP ) continued on its long-term decline in the Basque Country , whereas Citizens ( Cs ) failed to win any seat . Urkullu was able to get re-elected as lehendakari with the support of both his party and the PSE-EE .

  "/wiki/2017_Catalan_regional_election": "The 2017 Catalan regional election was held on Thursday , 21 December 2017 to elect the 12th Parliament of the autonomous community of Catalonia . All 135 seats in the Parliament were up for election . The election was called by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy after the invocation of Article 155 of the 1978 Spanish Constitution to enforce direct rule in Catalonia and the subsequent dismissal of the Catalan government under President Carles Puigdemont . The three pro-Catalan independence parties won a slim majority of parliamentary seats , claiming 70 out of 135 , but fell short of a majority in the popular vote by securing 47.6% of the share . Pro-Catalan independence parties maintained their parliamentary majority at the 2015 election , although then-President Artur Mas and his Junts pel S\u00ed ( JxS\u00ed ) coalition - made up primarily by Democratic Convergence of Catalonia ( CDC ) and Republican Left of Catalonia ( ERC ) - required from the support from Popular Unity Candidacy ( CUP ) to govern . The CUP 's decision to vote against Mas 's led to his witdrawal and to the election of Carles Puigdemont , until then mayor of Girona , as leader of a CDC-ERC coalition government . Shortly thereafter , CDC was re-founded as Catalan European Democratic Party ( PDeCAT ) . On 27 October 2017 , following the controversial referendum on 1 October , the pro-independence majority in the Catalan parliament voted in favour of a unilateral declaration of independence , just hours before the Spanish Senate voted to invoke Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution . This allowed Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to sack the Catalan government and dissolve the Catalan parliament , calling a regional election for 21 December . With 36 seats , the main anti-independence party , Citizens ( Cs ) , emerged as the largest in the Parliament . The Socialists ' Party of Catalonia ( PSC ) performed well below expectations and increased its seat count by one , whereas Catalunya en Com\u00fa-Podem , a left-wing party in favor of self-governance for the region but not siding itself with either bloc , received 7.5% of the vote and 8 seats . Owing to the combined performance of Puigdemont 's Junts per Catalunya ( JuntsxCat ) and ERC , parties in support of independence maintained their majority in the election , meaning that it was mathematically possible for a pro-independence coalition government to return to power , despite their overall majority having been reduced by two seats .",

Located in the northwest Iberian Peninsula , it includes the provinces of A Coru\u00f1a , Lugo , Ourense and Pontevedra . Galicia is bordered by Portugal to the south , the Spanish autonomous communities of Castile and Le\u00f3n and Asturias to the east , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , and the Cantabrian Sea to the north . It had a population of 2,701,743 in 2018 and a total area of 29,574 km2 ( 11,419 sq mi ) .

The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period , and takes its name from the Gallaeci , the Celtic people living north of the Douro River during the last millennium BC . Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC , and was made a Roman province in the 3rd century AD . In 410 , the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga ( Portugal ) ; this kingdom was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585 . In 711 , the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate invaded the Iberian Peninsula conquering the Visigoth kingdom of Hispania by 718 , but soon Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias by 740 . During the Middle Ages , the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings , but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile , while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and culture . From the 13th century on , the kings of Castile , as kings of Galicia , appointed an Adiantado-m\u00f3r , whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century .

It is spoken by some 2.4 million people , mainly in Galicia , an autonomous community located in northwestern Spain , where it is official along with Spanish . The language is also spoken in some border zones of the neighboring Spanish regions of Asturias and Castile and Le\u00f3n , as well as by Galician migrant communities in the rest of Spain , in Latin America including Puerto Rico , the United States , Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe . Modern Galician is part of the West Iberian languages group , a family of Romance languages that includes the Portuguese language , which developed locally from Vulgar Latin and evolved into what modern scholars have called Galician-Portuguese . Dialectal divergences are observable between the northern and southern forms of Galician-Portuguese in 13th-century texts but the two dialects were similar enough to maintain a high level of cultural unity until the middle of the 14th century , producing the medieval Galician-Portuguese lyric . The divergence has continued to this day , producing the modern languages of Galician and Portuguese . The lexicon of Galician is predominantly of Latin extraction , although it also contains a moderate number of words of Germanic and Celtic origin , among other substrates and adstrates , having also received , mainly via Spanish , a number of nouns from Andalusian Arabic . The language is officially regulated in Galicia by the Royal Galician Academy .

  "/wiki/Valencian_Community": "The Valencian Community [ a ] [ b ] is an autonomous community of Spain . It is the fourth most populous autonomous community after Andalusia , Catalonia and Madrid with more than five million inhabitants . Its homonymous capital Valencia is the third largest city and metropolitan area in Spain . It is located along the Mediterranean coast on the east side of the Iberian peninsula . It borders with Catalonia to the north , Aragon and Castilla-La Mancha to the west , and Murcia to the south . The Valencian Community consists of three provinces which are Castell\u00f3n , Valencia and Alicante . According to its Statute of Autonomy , the Valencian people are a nationality . Their origins date back to the Aragonese reconquest of the Moorish Taifa of Valencia , which was taken by James I of Aragon in 1238 during the Reconquista . The newly founded Kingdom of Valencia was granted wide self-government under the Crown of Aragon . Valencia experienced its golden age in the 15th century , as it became the Crown 's economic capital . Self-government continued after the unification of the Spanish Kingdom , but was eventually suspended in 1707 by Phillip V of Spain as a result of the Spanish War of Succession . Valencian nationalism resurged towards the end of the 19th century , which led to the modern conception of the Valencian Country .",

The main location of the Corts is in the Palace of the Borgias in Valencia ; however it can meet at any location in the Valencian lands . The Corts has its origins in bodies established in the thirteenth century by King James I of Aragon . The modern institution was established in 1982 under the Valencian statute of autonomy of 1982 . The current Corts were elected in 2015 .",
  "/wiki/Valencian_language": "Valencian or Valencian language ( /v\u0259\u02c8l\u025bn ( t ) si\u0259n , -n\u0283\u0259n/ ; endonym valenci\u00e0 , llengua valenciana or idioma valenci\u00e0 [ valensi\u02c8a , ba- ] ) [ note 1 ] is the historical , traditional and official name used in the Valencian Community ( Spain ) , and extra-officially in the El Carche comarca in Murcia ( Spain ) , to refer to the romance language also known as Catalan . [ note 2 ] [ note 3 ] The Valencian Community 's 1982 Statute of Autonomy and the Spanish Constitution officially recognise Valencian as the regional language . As a glottonym , it is used for referring either to the language as a whole [ note 2 ] [ note 3 ] or to the Valencian specific linguistic forms . [ note 2 ] [ note 4 ] According to philological studies , the varieties of this language spoken in the Valencian Community and El Carche can not be considered a dialect restricted to these borders : the several dialects of Valencian ( Alicante 's Valencian , Southern Valencian , Central Valencian or Apitxat , Castell\u00f3n 's Valencian and transitional Valencian ) belong to the Western group of Catalan dialects . Valencian displays transitional features between Ibero-Romance languages and Gallo-Romance languages . Its similarity with Occitan has led many authors to group it under the Occitano-Romance languages . There is a political controversy within the Valencian Community regarding its status as a glottonym or as a language on its own , since official reports show that slightly more than half of the people in the Valencian Community consider it as a separate language , different from Catalan , although the same studies show that this percentage decreases dramatically among younger generations and people with higher studies . According to the 2006 Statute of Autonomy Valencian is regulated by the Acad\u00e8mia Valenciana de la Llengua , by means of the Castell\u00f3 rules , which adapt the Catalan orthography to the Valencian idiosyncrasies . Due to not having been officially recognised for a long time , the number of speakers has severely decreased , and the influence of Spanish has led to the adoption of a huge amount of loanwords . Some of the most important works of Valencian literature experienced a golden age during the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance . Important works include Joanot Martorell 's chivalric romance Tirant lo Blanch , and Ausi\u00e0s March 's poetry . The first book produced with movable type in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in the Valencian variety .",
  "/wiki/Valencia,_Spain": "Valencia ( Spanish : [ ba\u02c8len\u03b8ja ] ) , officially Val\u00e8ncia ( Valencian : [ va\u02c8lensia ] ) , is the capital of the autonomous community of Valencia and the third-largest city in Spain after Madrid and Barcelona , with around 800,000 inhabitants in the administrative centre .

The Port of Valencia is the 5th busiest container port in Europe and the busiest container port on the Mediterranean Sea . The city is ranked at Beta-global city in the Globalization and World Cities Research Network . Valencia was founded as a Roman colony by the consul Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus in 138 BC , and called Valentia Edetanorum . In 714 Moroccan and Arab Moors occupied the city , introducing their language , religion and customs ; they implemented improved irrigation systems and the cultivation of new crops as well . Valencia was the capital of the Taifa of Valencia . In 1238 the Christian king James I of Aragon conquered the city and divided the land among the nobles who helped him conquer it , as witnessed in the Llibre del Repartiment . He also created a new law for the city , the Furs of Valencia , which were extended to the rest of the Kingdom of Valencia . In the 18th century Philip V of Spain abolished the privileges as punishment to the kingdom of Valencia for aligning with the Habsburg side in the War of the Spanish Succession . Valencia was the capital of Spain when Joseph Bonaparte moved the Court there in the summer of 1812 .",
