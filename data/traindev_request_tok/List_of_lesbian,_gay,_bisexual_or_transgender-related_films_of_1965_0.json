The film is propelled by the sonorous , magnetic acting of then-30-year old Ed Hood interacting with the dumb blonde Hustler , Paul America . [ citation needed ] Joe Campbell ( Sugar Plum Fairy ) , Genevieve Charbin and Dorothy Dean also compete for the attentions of the Hustler and provide foils for the interaction of the main characters . The erudite and very funny Hood , a perpetual graduate student in English at Harvard and live parody of southern gentility , was recruited by Chuck Wein . Hood 's magnetic performance was driven by his deep , mellifluous voice , trained by elocution lessons as a privileged child in Alabama , and lubricated copiously by alcohol . Among his many peculiarities was his habit of drinking beer from the bottle , not by placing the bottle to his lips , but into his mouth , sucking on it , as seen in the film . [ citation needed ]",

Its debut was as the opening film of the Commonwealth Film Festival ( Cardiff , September 27 , 1965 ) . It was also given a Special Jury Award at the 7th International Montreal Film Festival . The film starred John Labow as Doug Harris and Henry Tarvainen as Peter Saridan , two students at the University of Toronto who develop a complex quasi-romantic friendship , and Joy Tepperman and Janet Amos as their girlfriends Bev and Sandra . The film 's gay subtext was carefully coded by Secter , who wrote the film based on his own experience falling in love with a male fellow student but feared that a more explicitly gay film would not attract an audience . Even some of the film 's cast have claimed in interviews that they did not know at the time that the film was actually about homosexuality .",
