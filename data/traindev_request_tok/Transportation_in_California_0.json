  "/wiki/Commuter_rail": "Commuter rail , or suburban rail , is a passenger rail transport service that primarily operates within a metropolitan area , connecting commuters to a central city from adjacent suburbs or commuter towns . Generally commuter rail systems are considered heavy rail , using electrified or diesel trains . Distance charges or zone pricing may be used . The term can refer to systems with a wide variety of different features and service frequencies , but is often used in contrast to rapid transit or light rail . Similar non-English terms include Treno suburbano in Italian , Cercan\u00edas in Spanish , Rodalies in Catalan , Proastiakos in Greek , Train de banlieue in French , P\u0159\u00edm\u011bstsk\u00fd vlak or Esko in Czech , Elektrichka in Russian , Poci\u0105g podmiejski in Polish and Pendelt\u00e5g in Swedish . Some services share similarities with both commuter rail and high-frequency rapid transit , such as the German S-Bahn , the R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional in Paris , many Japanese commuter systems , and some Australasian suburban networks . Some services , like British commuter rail , share tracks with other passenger services and freight . In the United States , commuter rail often refers to services that operate a higher frequency during peak periods and a lower frequency off-peak . Since the creation of GO Transit 's commuter service in 1967 , commuter rail services and route length have been expanding in North America . In the US , commuter rail is sometimes referred to as regional rail .",

  "/wiki/Automated_guideway_transit": "The automated guideway transit ( AGT ) is a fully automated , driverless , grade-separated transit system in which vehicles are automatically guided along a guideway . The vehicles are often rubber tired or steel wheeled , but other systems including air cushion and maglev systems have also been used in experiments . The guideway normally provides both physical support , like a road , as well as the guidance . In the case of fixed-route systems , the two are often the same in the same way that a rail line provides both support and guidance for a train . For systems with multiple routes , most AGT systems use smaller wheels riding on the guideway to steer the vehicle using conventional steering arrangements like those on a car . AGT covers a wide variety of systems , from limited group rapid transit ( GRT ) systems ( also known as people mover systems ) , like those commonly found at airports , to more complex mass transit systems like the Vancouver SkyTrain . In the people mover role the term automated people mover ( APM ) is sometimes used , although this distinction is relatively rare because most people movers are automated . Larger systems span a variety of conceptual designs , from subway-like advanced rapid transit ( ART ) systems to smaller ( typically two to six passengers ) vehicles known as personal rapid transit ( PRT ) which offer direct point-to-point travel along a switched network .",

Other sources may exclude parts of or even entire counties , or expand the definition to include neighboring counties that do not border the bay such as San Benito , San Joaquin , and Santa Cruz .

The earliest archaeological evidence of human settlements in the Bay Area dates back to 8000-10,000 BC ( from shell mounds in the Coyote Hills ) . In 1769 , the Bay Area was inhabited by the Ohlone people when a Spanish exploration party led by Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 entered the Bay - the first documented European visit to the Bay Area . After Mexico established independence from Spain in 1821 , the region was briefly controlled by the Mexican government until the United States purchased the territory in 1846 during the Mexican-American War . Soon after , discovery of gold in California attracted a flood of treasure seekers , many using ports in the Bay Area as an entry point . During the early years of California 's statehood , state legislative business rotated between three locations in the Bay Area before a permanent state capital was established in Sacramento .

Today , most trams use electrical power , usually fed by a pantograph sliding on an overhead line ; older systems may use a trolley pole or a bow collector . In some cases by a contact shoe on a third rail is used . If necessary , they may have dual power systems - electricity in city streets , and diesel in more rural environments . Occasionally , trams also carry freight . Trams are now commonly included in the wider term light rail , which also includes grade-separated systems . Some trams , known as tram-trains , may have segments that run on mainline railway tracks , similar to interurban systems . The differences between these modes of rail transport are often indistinct , and a given system may combine multiple features .",
