Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles .

It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right .

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University ."
