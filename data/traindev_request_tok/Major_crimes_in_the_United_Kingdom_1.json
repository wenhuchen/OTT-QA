  "/wiki/Eastbourne_manslaughter": "R v Hopley ( more commonly known as the Eastbourne manslaughter ) was an 1860 legal case in Eastbourne , England , concerning the death of 15-year-old Reginald Cancellor ( some sources give his name as Chancellor and his age as 13 or 14 ) at the hands of his teacher , Thomas Hopley . Hopley used corporal punishment with the stated intention of overcoming what he perceived as stubbornness on Cancellor 's part , but instead beat the boy to death . An inquest into Cancellor 's death began when his brother requested an autopsy . As a result of the inquest Hopley was arrested and charged with manslaughter . He was found guilty at trial and sentenced to four years in prison , although he insisted that his actions were justifiable and that he was not guilty of any crime . The trial was sensationalised by the Victorian press and incited debate over the use of corporal punishment in schools . After Hopley 's release and subsequent divorce trial , he largely disappeared from the public record . The case became an important legal precedent in the United Kingdom for discussions of corporal punishment in schools and reasonable limits on discipline .",
  "/wiki/Eastbourne": "Eastbourne ( /\u02c8i\u02d0stb\u0254\u02d0rn/ ( listen ) ) is a town , seaside resort and borough in the non-metropolitan county of East Sussex on the south coast of England , 19 miles ( 31 km ) east of Brighton . Eastbourne is immediately to the east of Beachy Head , the highest chalk sea cliff in Great Britain and part of the larger Eastbourne Downland Estate . With a seafront consisting largely of Victorian hotels , a pier and a Napoleonic era fort and military museum , Eastbourne was developed at the direction of the Duke of Devonshire from 1859 from four separate hamlets . It has a growing population , a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries . Though Eastbourne is a relatively new town , there is evidence of human occupation in the area from the Stone Age . The town grew as a fashionable tourist resort largely thanks to prominent landowner , William Cavendish , later to become the Duke of Devonshire . Cavendish appointed architect Henry Currey to design a street plan for the town , but not before sending him to Europe to draw inspiration . The resulting mix of architecture is typically Victorian and remains a key feature of Eastbourne . As a seaside resort Eastbourne derives a large and increasing income from tourism , with revenue from traditional seaside attractions augmented by conferences , public events and cultural sightseeing . The other main industries in Eastbourne include trade and retail , healthcare , education , construction , manufacturing , professional scientific and the technical sector . Eastbourne 's population is growing ; between 2001 and 2011 it increased from 89,800 to 99,412 . The 2011 census shows that the average age of residents has decreased as the town has attracted students , families and those commuting to London and Brighton .",
  "/wiki/Corporal_punishment": "Corporal punishment or physical punishment is a punishment intended to cause physical pain to a person . It is most often practised on minors , especially in home and school settings . Common methods include spanking or paddling . It has also historically been used on adults , particularly on prisoners and enslaved people . Other common methods include flagellation . Punishment for crime by inflicting pain or injury , including flogging , branding and even mutilation , was practised in most civilizations since ancient times . However , with the growth of humanitarian ideals since the Enlightenment , such punishments were increasingly viewed as inhumane . By the late 20th century , corporal punishment had been eliminated from the legal systems of most developed countries . The legality in the 21st century of corporal punishment in various settings differs by jurisdiction . Internationally , the late 20th century and early 21st century saw the application of human rights law to the question of corporal punishment in a number of contexts :",
  "/wiki/Fanny_Adams": "Fanny Adams ( 30 April 1859 - 24 August 1867 ) was an English girl who was murdered by solicitor 's clerk Frederick Baker in Alton , Hampshire , on 24 August 1867 . The murder itself was extraordinarily brutal and caused a national outcry in the United Kingdom . Fanny was abducted by Baker and taken into a hop garden near her home . She was then brutally murdered and her body cut into several pieces , with some parts never being found . Further investigations suggested that two small knives were used for the murder , but it was later ruled they would have been insufficient to carry out the crime and that another weapon must have been used . Used to express total downtime or inaction , the military , manual-trade and locker room talk phrase sweet Fanny Adams has been in use since at least the mid 20th century , vying with a stronger expletive . [ n 1 ] Unusually , the phrase is not a bowdlerisation ; Fanny Adams arrived in 1860s naval slang to deplore unliked meat stews . It broadened to mean anything badly substandard then further so as to merge with the expletive sharing its initial letters to mean nothing at all . The phrase also appears today as sweet F.A .",

The county town is the city of Winchester . Its two largest cities , Southampton and Portsmouth , are administered separately as unitary authorities ; the rest of the county is governed by Hampshire County Council . First settled about 14,000 years ago , Hampshire 's history dates to Roman Britain , when its chief town was Winchester . When the Romans left Britain , the area was infiltrated by tribes from Scandinavia and mainland Europe , principally in the river valleys . The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book , divided into 44 hundreds . From the 12th century , the ports grew in importance , fuelled by trade with the continent , wool and cloth manufacture in the county , and the fishing industry , and a shipbuilding industry was established . By the 16th century , the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester . By the mid-19th century , with the county 's population at 219,210 ( double that at the beginning of the century ) in more than 86,000 dwellings , agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest .

  "/wiki/Solicitor's_clerk": "An articled clerk is someone who is studying to be an accountant or a lawyer . In doing so , they are put under the supervision of someone already in the profession , now usually for two years these days , but previously three to five years was common . This can be compared as being an intern for a company . Trainees are obligated to sign a contract agreeing to the terms of being an articled clerk . The articled clerk signs a contract , known as articles of clerkship , committing to a fixed period of employment . Wharton 's Law Lexicon defines an articled clerk as a pupil of a solicitor , who undertakes , by articles of clerkship , continuing covenants , mutually binding , to instruct him in the principles and practice of the profession . The contract is with a specific partner in the firm and not with the firm as a whole . Now , some professions in some countries prefer to use the term students or trainees ( e.g . a trainee solicitor ) and the articles of clerkship training contracts . Apprentice architects can also be articled . Henry Percy Adams articled to Britwen Binyon ( 1846-1909 ) , architect .",

Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East , and forms the core of the Tyneside conurbation , the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom . Newcastle is a member of the UK Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities . Newcastle was part of the county of Northumberland until 1400 , when it became a county of itself , a status it retained until becoming part of Tyne and Wear in 1974 . The regional nickname and dialect for people from Newcastle and the surrounding area is Geordie . Newcastle also houses Newcastle University , a member of the Russell Group , as well as Northumbria University .

  "/wiki/Life_imprisonment": "Life imprisonment ( also known as imprisonment for life , life in prison , whole-life order , a life sentence , a life term , lifelong incarceration , life incarceration or simply life ) is any sentence of imprisonment for a crime under which convicted persons are to remain in prison either for the rest of their natural life or until paroled or otherwise commuted to a fixed term . Crimes for which , in some countries , a person could receive this sentence include murder , attempted murder , conspiracy to commit murder , blasphemy , apostasy , terrorism , severe child abuse , rape , child rape , espionage , treason , high treason , drug dealing , drug trafficking , drug possession , human trafficking , severe cases of fraud , severe cases of financial crimes , aggravated criminal damage in English law , and aggravated cases of arson , kidnapping , burglary , or robbery which result in death or grievous bodily harm , piracy , aircraft hijacking , and in certain cases genocide , ethnic cleansing , crimes against humanity , certain war crimes or any three felonies in case of three strikes law . Life imprisonment ( as a maximum term ) can also be imposed , in certain countries , for traffic offenses causing death . The life sentence does not exist in all countries : Portugal was the first to abolish life imprisonment , in 1884 . Where life imprisonment is a possible sentence , there may also exist formal mechanisms for requesting parole after a certain period of prison time . This means that a convict could be entitled to spend the rest of the sentence ( until that individual dies ) outside prison . Early release is usually conditional on past and future conduct , possibly with certain restrictions or obligations . In contrast , when a fixed term of imprisonment has ended , the convict is free . The length of time served and the conditions surrounding parole vary . Being eligible for parole does not necessarily ensure that parole will be granted . In some countries , including Sweden , parole does not exist but a life sentence may - after a successful application - be commuted to a fixed-term sentence , after which the culprit is released as if the sentence served was that originally imposed . In many countries around the world , particularly in the Commonwealth , courts have the authority to pass prison terms which may amount to de facto life imprisonment .",

The county itself is a NUTS 2 region within the wider NUTS 1 region of the same name . The county consists of seven metropolitan boroughs : the City of Birmingham , the City of Coventry and the City of Wolverhampton , as well as the boroughs of Dudley , Sandwell , Solihull and Walsall . The metropolitan county exists in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county it has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . Between 1974 and 1986 , the West Midlands County Council was the administrative body covering the county ; this was abolished on 31 March 1986 , and the constituent metropolitan boroughs effectively became unitary authorities . A new administrative body for the county ( and some of the district surrounding it as Non-Constituent members ) , the West Midlands Combined Authority , was created in June 2016 . Since May 2017 , the authority has been headed by a directly elected Mayor of the West Midlands , a position currently held by Andy Street of the Conservative Party . Other county-wide bodies include the West Midlands Police , the West Midlands Fire Service and Transport for West Midlands . The county is sometimes described as the West Midlands metropolitan area or the West Midlands conurbation or Greater Birmingham , although these have different , and less clearly defined , boundaries .

One of the home counties , Berkshire was recognised by the Queen as the Royal County of Berkshire in 1957 because of the presence of Windsor Castle , and letters patent were issued in 1974 . Berkshire is a county of historic origin , a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council . The county town is Reading . The River Thames formed the historic northern boundary , from Buscot in the west to Old Windsor in the east . The historic county therefore includes territory that is now administered by the Vale of White Horse and parts of South Oxfordshire in Oxfordshire , but excludes Caversham , Slough and five less populous settlements in the east of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead . All the changes mentioned , apart from the change to Caversham , took place in 1974 . The towns of Abingdon , Didcot , Faringdon , Wallingford and Wantage were transferred to Oxfordshire , the six places joining came from Buckinghamshire . Berkshire County Council was the main local government of most areas from 1889 to 1998 and was based in Reading , the county town which had its own County Borough administration ( 1888-1974 ) . Since 1998 , Berkshire has been governed by the six unitary authorities of Bracknell Forest , Reading , Slough , West Berkshire , Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham . The ceremonial county borders Oxfordshire ( to the north ) , Buckinghamshire ( to the north-east ) , Greater London ( to the east ) , Surrey ( to the south-east ) , Wiltshire ( to the west ) and Hampshire ( to the south ) .",
  "/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger": "James Patrick Bulger ( 16 March 1990 - 12 February 1993 ) was a 2-year-old boy from Kirkby , Merseyside , England , who was abducted , tortured and killed by two 10-year-old boys , Robert Thompson and Jon Venables . Bulger was led away from the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle as his mother had taken her eyes off him momentarily . His mutilated body was found on a railway line 2.5 miles ( 4 km ) away in Walton , Liverpool , two days after his abduction . Thompson and Venables were charged on 20 February 1993 with Bulger 's abduction and murder . They were found guilty on 24 November 1993 , making them the youngest convicted murderers in modern British history . They were sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure until a Parole Board decision in June 2001 recommended their release on a lifelong licence aged 18 . In 2010 , Venables was sent to prison for breaching the terms of his licence , and was released on parole again in 2013 . In November 2017 , Venables was again sent to prison for possessing child abuse images on his computer . The Bulger case has prompted widespread debate on the issue of how to handle young offenders when they are sentenced or released from custody .",

  "/wiki/Merseyside": "Merseyside ( /\u02c8m\u025c\u02d0rzisa\u026ad/ MUR-zee-syde ) is a metropolitan county in North West England , with a population of 1.38 million . It encompasses the metropolitan area centred on both banks of the lower reaches of the Mersey Estuary and comprises five metropolitan boroughs : Knowsley , St Helens , Sefton , Wirral , and the city of Liverpool . Merseyside , which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , takes its name from the River Mersey . Merseyside spans 249 square miles ( 645 km2 ) of land which border Lancashire ( to the north-east ) , Greater Manchester ( to the east ) , Cheshire ( to the south and south-east ) and the Irish Sea to the west . North Wales is across the Dee Estuary . There is a mix of high density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Merseyside , but overwhelmingly the land use is urban . It has a focused central business district , formed by Liverpool City Centre , but Merseyside is also a polycentric county with five metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . The Liverpool Urban Area is the fifth most populous conurbation in England , and dominates the geographic centre of the county , while the smaller Birkenhead Urban Area dominates the Wirral Peninsula in the south . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Merseyside County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) are now effectively unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continues to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and several county-wide services are co-ordinated by authorities and joint-boards , such as Merseytravel ( for public transport ) , Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the Merseyside Police ( for law-enforcement ) ; as a ceremonial county , Merseyside has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . As the Lancashire county palatine boundaries remain the same as the historic boundaries , the High Sheriff of Merseyside , along with those of Lancashire and Greater Manchester are appointed within the Duchy and County Palatine of Lancaster .",
  "/wiki/Child_pornography": "Child pornography is pornography that exploits children for sexual stimulation . It may be produced with the direct involvement or sexual assault of a child ( also known as child sexual abuse images ) or it may be simulated child pornography . Abuse of the child occurs during the sexual acts or lascivious exhibitions of genitals or pubic areas which are recorded in the production of child pornography . Child pornography may use a variety of media , including writings , magazines , photos , sculpture , drawing , cartoon , painting , animation , sound recording , film , video , and video games . Laws regarding child pornography generally include sexual images involving prepubescents , pubescent or post-pubescent minors and computer-generated images that appear to involve them . Most possessors of child pornography who are arrested are found to possess images of prepubescent children ; possessors of pornographic images of post-pubescent minors are less likely to be prosecuted , even though those images also fall within the statutes . Producers of child pornography try to avoid prosecution by distributing their material across national borders , though this issue is increasingly being addressed with regular arrests of suspects from a number of countries occurring over the last few years . The prepubescent pornography is viewed and collected by pedophiles for a variety of purposes , ranging from private sexual uses , trading with other pedophiles , preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the process known as child grooming , or enticement leading to entrapment for sexual exploitation such as production of new child pornography or child prostitution . Children themselves also sometimes produce child pornography on their own initiative or by the coercion of an adult . Child pornography is illegal and censored in most jurisdictions in the world . Ninety-four of 187 Interpol member states had laws specifically addressing child pornography as of 2008 , though this does not include nations that ban all pornography . Of those 94 countries , 58 criminalized possession of child pornography regardless of intent to distribute .",

  "/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice": "The High Court of Justice in London , together with the Court of Appeal and the Crown Court , are the Senior Courts of England and Wales . Its name is abbreviated as EWHC for legal citation purposes . The High Court deals at first instance with all high value and high importance cases , and also has a supervisory jurisdiction over all subordinate courts and tribunals , with a few statutory exceptions . The High Court consists of three divisions : the Queen 's Bench Division , the Chancery Division , and the Family Division . Their jurisdictions overlap in some cases , and cases started in one division may be transferred by court order to another where appropriate . The differences of procedure and practice between divisions are partly historical , derived from the separate courts which were merged into the single High Court by the 19th-century Judicature Acts , but are mainly driven by the usual nature of their work , for example , conflicting evidence of fact is quite commonly given in person in the Queen 's Bench Division , but evidence by affidavit is more usual in the Chancery Division which is primarily concerned with points of law . Most High Court proceedings are heard by a single judge , but certain kinds of proceedings , especially in the Queen 's Bench Division , are assigned to a divisional court , a bench of two or more judges . Exceptionally the court may sit with a jury , but in practice normally only in defamation cases or cases against the police . Litigants are normally represented by counsel but may be represented by solicitors qualified to hold a right of audience , or they may act in person . In principle , the High Court is bound by its own previous decisions , but there are conflicting authorities as to what extent this is so . Appeal from the High Court in civil matters normally lies to the Court of Appeal , and thence in cases of importance to the Supreme Court ( the House of Lords before 2009 ) ; in some cases a leapfrog appeal may be made directly to the Supreme Court . In criminal matters appeals from the Queen 's Bench Divisional Court are made directly to the Supreme Court .",
