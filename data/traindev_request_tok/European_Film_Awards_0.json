  "/wiki/West_Berlin": "West Berlin ( German : Berlin ( West ) or colloquially West-Berlin ) was a political enclave which comprised the western part of Berlin during the years of the Cold War . There was no specific date on which the sectors of Berlin occupied by the Western Allies became West Berlin , but 1949 is widely accepted as the year in which the name was adopted . West Berlin aligned itself politically with the Federal Republic of Germany ( called the Bonn Republic by historians ) and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions . West Berlin was formally controlled by the Western Allies and was entirely surrounded by the Soviet-controlled East Berlin and East Germany . West Berlin had great symbolic significance during the Cold War , as it was widely considered by westerners as an island of freedom . It was heavily subsidised by West Germany as a showcase of the West . A wealthy city , West Berlin was noted for its distinctly cosmopolitan character , and as a centre of education , research and culture . With about two million inhabitants , West Berlin had the largest population of any city in Germany during the Cold War era . West Berlin was 100 miles ( 161 kilometres ) east and north of the Inner German border and only accessible by land from West Germany by narrow rail and highway corridors . It consisted of the American , British , and French occupation sectors established in 1945 . The Berlin Wall , built in 1961 , physically separated West Berlin from its East Berlin and East German surroundings until it fell in 1989 . On 3 October 1990 , the day Germany was officially reunified , East and West Berlin formally reunited as the city of Berlin .",
