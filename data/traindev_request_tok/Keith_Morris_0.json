  "/wiki/Bad_Religion": "Bad Religion is an American punk rock band that formed in Los Angeles , California in 1980 . The band 's lyrics cover topics related to religion , politics , and science . Musically , they are noted for their melodic sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies . The band has experienced multiple line-up changes , with singer Greg Graffin being the band 's only constant member , though fellow founding members Jay Bentley and Brett Gurewitz have since rejoined , and guitarist Brian Baker has performed with the group since 1994 . The most recent additions to the band are guitarist Mike Dimkich and drummer Jamie Miller , who joined in 2013 and 2015 respectively . To date , Bad Religion has released seventeen studio albums , two live albums , three compilation albums , three EPs , and two live DVDs . They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time , having sold over five million albums worldwide . By the time they were signed to Atlantic Records in 1993 , Bad Religion had built an underground following with their early albums , including Suffer ( 1988 ) , No Control ( 1989 ) , Against the Grain ( 1990 ) and Generator ( 1992 ) . The band first reached substantial commercial success with their seventh studio album and Atlantic debut Recipe for Hate ( 1993 ) , which peaked at number 14 on Billboard 's Heatseekers chart , and spawned one of their most popular songs American Jesus . Recipe for Hate was followed a year later by Stranger than Fiction ( 1994 ) , which spawned their biggest hits Infected and the re-recorded version of 21st Century ( Digital Boy ) , and was certified gold in both the United States and Canada . Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction , Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis ( in response to the success of the label 's then-artists the Offspring and Rancid ) , and was replaced by Brian Baker . Since Gurewitz 's return to the band and their split with Atlantic in 2001 , they have undergone a resurgence in popularity , with their sixteenth studio album True North ( 2013 ) becoming Bad Religion 's first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart , where it peaked at number 19 .",

After the departure of long-time drummer Bob Bryar in March 2010 , the band released their fourth studio album , Danger Days : The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys , in November that same year , to positive reviews .

  "/wiki/Three_Cheers_for_Sweet_Revenge": "Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is the second studio album by American rock band My Chemical Romance , released on June 8 , 2004 by Reprise Records . With this album , the band produced a cleaner sound than that of their 2002 debut I Brought You My Bullets , You Brought Me Your Love . It was the band 's final release to feature drummer Matt Pelissier , who would later be replaced by Bob Bryar . Gerard Way , the lead singer of the band , who also designed its artwork , has described the album as a pseudo-conceptual horror story , stating that it is the story of a man and a woman who are separated by death in a gunfight and he goes to hell only to realize by the devil telling him that she 's still alive . The devil says he can be with her again if he brings the devil the souls of a thousand evil men and the man agrees to do it , and so the devil hands him a gun . That was the idea behind the concept , the record ended up being much more about loss and real life than anything , so I would say it 's a good split . The album was a success for both the band and the label , The record produced several radio singles and popular MTV videos , including I 'm Not Okay ( I Promise ) , Helena , and The Ghost of You . The four singles from the album included I 'm Not Okay ( I Promise ) , Helena , The Ghost of You , and in the United Kingdom , Thank You for the Venom .
