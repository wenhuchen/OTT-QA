  "/wiki/Tower_mill": "A tower mill is a type of vertical windmill consisting of a brick or stone tower , on which sits a wooden 'cap ' or roof , which can rotate to bring the sails into the wind . This rotating cap on a firm masonry base gave tower mills great advantages over earlier post mills , as they could stand much higher , bear larger sails , and thus afford greater reach into the wind . Windmills in general had been known to civilization for centuries , but the tower mill represented an improvement on traditional western-style windmills . The tower mill was an important source of power for Europe for nearly 600 years from 1300-1900 , contributing to 25 percent of the industrial power of all wind machines before the advent of the steam engine and coal power . It represented a modification or a demonstration of improving and adapting technology that had been known by humans for ages . Although these types of mills were effective , some argue that , owing to their complexity , they would have initially been built mainly by the most wealthy individuals .",

In the Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox religions , he is called Saint Michael the Taxiarch . In other Protestant churches , he is simply called Archangel Michael . Michael is mentioned three times in the Book of Daniel . The idea that Michael was the advocate of the Jews became so prevalent that , in spite of the rabbinical prohibition against appealing to angels as intermediaries between God and his people , Michael came to occupy a certain place in the Jewish liturgy . In the New Testament , Michael leads God 's armies against Satan 's forces in the Book of Revelation , where during the war in heaven he defeats Satan . In the Epistle of Jude , Michael is specifically referred to as the archangel Michael .
