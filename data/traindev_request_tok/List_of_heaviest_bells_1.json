  "/wiki/Royal_Eijsbouts_bell_foundry": "Royal Eijsbouts ( Dutch : Koninklijke Eijsbouts ) is a bell foundry located in Asten , Netherlands . The workshop was founded in 1872 by Bonaventura Eijsbouts as a factory for tower clocks . In 1893 Eijsbouts was joined by his 15-year-old son , Johan , and the workshop expanded to begin supplying striking and swinging bells , which were cast at other foundries , with their clocks . As interest in carillons increased , Johan Eijsbouts purchased bells from two English foundries , John Taylor Bellfounders and Gillett & Johnston , and installed them in carillons . In 1924 , Johan 's oldest son , Tuur Eijsbouts , joined the company . Tuur was technically minded and inventive . He took the initiative to learn how to cast bells himself . After years of experimentation , an in-house bell foundry was installed in 1947 . The company is still recognized for their cast bells , which are used in carillons and church bells . In 2006 Eijsbouts cast the largest swinging bell in the world . Royal Eijsbouts has been involved in extensive research programs in campanology ( the art of bell manufacturing ) for decades . Those efforts have resulted in computer applications with which all aspects of bell sound and bell shape can be accurately calculated .",
