  "/wiki/Illinois_High_School_Association": "The Illinois High School Association ( IHSA ) is a state high school association in the United States that regulates competition in most interscholastic sports and some interscholastic activities at the high school level . It is a charter member of the National Federation of State High School Associations ( NFHS ) . The IHSA regulates 14 sports for boys , 15 sports for girls , and eight co-educational non-athletic activities . More than 760 public and private high schools in the state of Illinois are members of the IHSA . The Association 's offices are in Bloomington , Illinois . In its over 100 years of existence , the IHSA has been at the center of many controversies . Some of these controversies ( inclusion of sports for girls , the inclusion of private schools , drug testing , and the use of the term March Madness ) have had national resonance , or paralleled the struggles seen in other states across the country . Other controversies ( geographic advancement of teams to the state playoff series , struggles between small schools and large schools , particular rules unique to Illinois competition ) are more of a local focus .",

  "/wiki/Rocket": "A rocket ( from Italian rocchetto bobbin ) [ nb 1 ] is a missile , spacecraft , aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine . Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket . Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed , and can therefore work in the vacuum of space . In fact , rockets work more efficiently in space than in an atmosphere . Multistage rockets are capable of attaining escape velocity from Earth and therefore can achieve unlimited maximum altitude . Compared with airbreathing engines , rockets are lightweight and powerful and capable of generating large accelerations . To control their flight , rockets rely on momentum , airfoils , auxiliary reaction engines , gimballed thrust , momentum wheels , deflection of the exhaust stream , propellant flow , spin , or gravity . Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th-century China . Significant scientific , interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century , when rocketry was the enabling technology for the Space Age , including setting foot on the Earth 's moon . Rockets are now used for fireworks , weaponry , ejection seats , launch vehicles for artificial satellites , human spaceflight , and space exploration . Chemical rockets are the most common type of high power rocket , typically creating a high speed exhaust by the combustion of fuel with an oxidizer . The stored propellant can be a simple pressurized gas or a single liquid fuel that disassociates in the presence of a catalyst ( monopropellants ) , two liquids that spontaneously react on contact ( hypergolic propellants ) , two liquids that must be ignited to react , a solid combination of fuel with oxidizer ( solid fuel ) , or solid fuel with liquid oxidizer ( hybrid propellant system ) .",

  "/wiki/Trojan_Army": "In Greek mythology , the Trojan War ( Greek : \u03a4\u03c1\u03c9\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ; Turkish : Truva Sava\u015f\u0131 ) was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans ( Greeks ) after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus , king of Sparta . The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature , most notably Homer 's Iliad . The core of the Iliad ( Books II - XXIII ) describes a period of four days and two nights in the tenth year of the decade-long siege of Troy ; the Odyssey describes the journey home of Odysseus , one of the war 's heroes . Other parts of the war are described in a cycle of epic poems , which have survived through fragments . Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature , and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid . The war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses Hera , Athena , and Aphrodite , after Eris , the goddess of strife and discord , gave them a golden apple , sometimes known as the Apple of Discord , marked for the fairest . Zeus sent the goddesses to Paris , who judged that Aphrodite , as the fairest , should receive the apple . In exchange , Aphrodite made Helen , the most beautiful of all women and wife of Menelaus , fall in love with Paris , who took her to Troy . Agamemnon , king of Mycenae and the brother of Helen 's husband Menelaus , led an expedition of Achaean troops to Troy and besieged the city for ten years because of Paris ' insult . After the deaths of many heroes , including the Achaeans Achilles and Ajax , and the Trojans Hector and Paris , the city fell to the ruse of the Trojan Horse . The Achaeans slaughtered the Trojans ( except for some of the women and children whom they kept or sold as slaves ) and desecrated the temples , thus earning the gods ' wrath . Few of the Achaeans returned safely to their homes and many founded colonies in distant shores .",

  "/wiki/Tiger": "The tiger ( Panthera tigris ) is the largest species among the Felidae and classified in the genus Panthera . It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orangish-brown fur with a lighter underside . It is an apex predator , primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar . It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator , requiring large contiguous areas of habitat , which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring . Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years , before they become independent and leave their mother 's home range to establish their own . The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin , and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands . Since the early 20th century , tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia , from the islands of Java and Bali , and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China . Today 's tiger range is fragmented , stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra . The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986 . As of 2015 , the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals , down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century , with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other . Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction , habitat fragmentation and poaching . This , coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more densely populated places on Earth , has caused significant conflicts with humans .",
  "/wiki/Crystal_Lake_South_High_School": "Crystal Lake South High School , often referred to as South or CLS , is one of three high schools in Crystal Lake , Illinois , and currently has a body of roughly 1916 students . As Crystal Lake 's second oldest school , it was constructed from 1976 to 1978 and opened in September 1978 after Crystal Lake Community High School , now Crystal Lake Central High School , split into two schools due to the pressures of the population growth in the communities it served , Crystal Lake , a part of Lake in the Hills and a small portion of Algonquin . South graduated its first class in 1979 - this class consisted of approximately 250 seniors who were transferred from Crystal Lake Central High School . South graduated its first class who attended all four years in 1982 . After the community 's school split , the South Gators and Central Tigers became rivals in the Fox Valley Conference . Though recently , focus of rivalry has primarily shifted to the Cary-Grove High School Trojans and the Prairie Ridge Wolves due to vastly increased competition in football games between the two schools . However , an underlying tone of competition still vibrates between the two Crystal Lake schools . The city of Crystal Lake has grown rapidly since South first opened it doors . The school reached its structural capacity in 2002 . A new addition opened for the 2003-2004 school year , with several dozen new classrooms .

Like all eagles , it belongs to the family Accipitridae . These birds are dark brown , with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes . Immature eagles of this species typically have white on the tail and often have white markings on the wings . Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive , sharp talons to snatch up a variety of prey , mainly hares , rabbits , and marmots and other ground squirrels . Golden eagles maintain home ranges or territories that may be as large as 200 km2 ( 77 sq mi ) . They build large nests in cliffs and other high places to which they may return for several breeding years . Most breeding activities take place in the spring ; they are monogamous and may remain together for several years or possibly for life . Females lay up to four eggs , and then incubate them for six weeks . Typically , one or two young survive to fledge in about three months .

  "/wiki/Wolf": "The wolf ( Canis lupus ) , also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf , is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America . It is the largest extant member of Canidae , with males averaging 40 kg ( 88 lb ) and females 37 kg ( 82 lb ) . On average , wolves measure 105-160 cm ( 41-63 in ) in length and 80-85 cm ( 31-33 in ) at shoulder height . The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed features , particularly the ears and muzzle . The wolf is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species , such as the coyote and the golden jackal , to produce fertile hybrids with them . The winter fur of a wolf is long and bushy and predominantly mottled gray , although nearly pure white , red and brown to black colours also occur . Up to 38 subspecies of wolf have been recognized including the domestic dog . The wolf is the most specialized member of the genus Canis for cooperative big game hunting , as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey , its more social nature , and its highly advanced expressive behaviour . It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring . Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition within the pack for food . Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality . The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds primarily on large wild hooved mammals , though it also eats smaller animals , livestock , carrion , and garbage ."
