  "/wiki/Arrow_Dynamics": "Arrow Dynamics was an American manufacturing and engineering company that specialized in designing and building amusement park rides , especially roller coasters . Based in Clearfield , Utah , the company was the successor to Arrow Development ( 1946-1981 ) and Arrow Huss ( 1981-1986 ) , which were responsible for several influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries . Among the most significant was tubular steel track , which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on wooden roller coasters . The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland , built in 1959 , was Arrow 's first roller coaster project . In 1975 , Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track Corkscrew , at Knott 's Berry Farm that sent riders through a series of corkscrews . Arrow created several other firsts over the years , introducing the first suspended roller coaster in almost a century , The Bat , in 1981 , and the world 's first hypercoaster , Magnum XL-200 , which opened in 1989 . They built the first 4th Dimension roller coaster , X2 , which was designed by Alan Schilke in 2002 . Arrow Development 's ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s . Arrow Dynamics would eventually survive two bankruptcies and spin off a sister company , Fabriweld , primarily to build track , by 1988 . Arrow Dynamics eventually closed on December 3 , 2001 . S & S Worldwide purchased part of Arrow 's remaining assets on October 28 , 2002 , and the remainder of the company was dissolved . In 2012 , Sansei Yusoki Co. of Osaka , Japan , acquired a 77.3% interest in S & S - Arrow .",

  "/wiki/Davenport_Locomotive_Works": "The Davenport Locomotive Works , of Davenport , Iowa , USA was formed as the W W Whitehead Company in 1901 . In 1902 the company commenced building light locomotives . The Company was renamed the Davenport Locomotive Works in 1904 . In late 1930 Davenport was licensed to assemble and market R G LeTourneau Inc products under the Davenport-LeTourneau brand . The agreement is believed to have ended in 1935 when LeTourneaus moved to Peoria , Illinois . Davenport also sold Davenport-Winchell three-wheel roller conversions of industrial wheel tractors , Davenport-Frink snow plows which were built in license from Frink Sno-Plows Inc and Reynolds patented Mov-Mor rotary scrapers . In 1933 the company was again restructured and renamed the Davenport-Besler Corporation which continued in business until 1956 . William George Besler was a Director at the time of the restructuring . The company acquired the locomotive business of H. K. Porter , Inc in 1950 and from then on produced Porter designs as well as its own . The company built small steam locomotives early on ; the first gasoline-fueled internal combustion engined locomotive was built in 1924 and the first diesel locomotive in 1927 , a 30-short-ton ( 26.8-long-ton ; 27.2 t ) diesel-electric for the Northern Illinois Coal Company of Boonville , Indiana . An extensive range of diesel locomotives in all industrial sizes followed , utilizing either mechanical torque converter or electric transmission , the former for the smaller locomotives . Most were used by a variety of industrial users , but some railroads also bought Davenport locomotives , particularly of the 44-short-ton ( 39.3-long-ton ; 39.9 t ) size , that being the largest locomotive then allowed by union rules to be operated by one man .",
  "/wiki/H.K._Porter,_Inc.": "H.K . Porter , Inc. ( Porter ) manufactured light-duty railroad locomotives in the US , starting in 1866 . The company became the largest producer of industrial locomotives , and built almost eight thousand of them . The last locomotive was built in 1950 , but the company continues to produce industrial equipment to this day . Porter was known for building locomotives that were much smaller than those normally used by the larger Class I railroads . The company 's locomotives were small enough that they were often operated by only one person . Porter built mostly steam locomotives , but they also built some powered by gasoline and diesel engines , and some that ran on compressed air . The largest collection of Porter photographs and information is currently housed in the Kentlein Porter Collection at the A. C. Kalmbach Memorial Library ( a service of the National Model Railroad Association ) in Chattanooga , TN . Many of the 780 builder 's photos , blueprints and other locomotive data were republished in Porter Steam Locomotives , published by the library .",

  "/wiki/3_ft_gauge_railways": "Three foot gauge railways have a track gauge of 3 ft ( 914 mm ) or 1 yard . This gauge is a narrow gauge and is generally found throughout North , Central , and South America . In Ireland , many secondary and industrial lines were built to 3 ft gauge , and it is the dominant gauge on the Isle of Man , where it is known as the Manx Standard Gauge . Modern 3 ft gauge railways are most commonly found in isolated mountainous areas , on small islands , or in large-scale amusement parks and theme parks ( see table below ) . This gauge is also popular in model railroading ( particularly in G scale ) , and model prototypes of these railways have been made by several model train brands around the world , such as Accucraft Trains ( US ) , Aristo-Craft Trains ( US ) , Bachmann Industries ( Hong Kong ) , Delton Locomotive Works ( US ) , LGB ( Germany ) , and PIKO ( Germany ) .",
  "/wiki/Narrow_gauge_railways": "A narrow-gauge railway ( narrow-gauge railroad in the US ) is a railway with a track gauge narrower than standard 1,435 mm ( 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in ) . Most narrow-gauge railways are between 600 mm ( 1 ft 11 5\u20448 in ) and 1,067 mm ( 3 ft 6 in ) . Since narrow-gauge railways are usually built with tighter curves , smaller structure gauges , and lighter rails , they can be less costly to build , equip , and operate than standard- or broad-gauge railways ( particularly in mountainous or difficult terrain ) . Lower-cost narrow-gauge railways are often built to serve industries and communities where the traffic potential would not justify the cost of a standard- or broad-gauge line . Narrow-gauge railways have specialized use in mines and other environments where a small structure gauge necessitates a small loading gauge . They also have more general applications . Non-industrial , narrow-gauge mountain railways are ( or were ) common in the Rocky Mountains of the United States and the Pacific Cordillera of Canada , Mexico , Switzerland , the former Yugoslavia , Greece , and Costa Rica . In some countries , narrow gauge is the standard ; Japan , Indonesia , Taiwan , New Zealand , South Africa , and the Australian states of Queensland , Western Australia and Tasmania have a 3 ft 6 in ( 1,067 mm ) gauge , and Malaysia and Thailand have metre-gauge railways . Narrow-gauge trams , particularly metre-gauge , are common in Europe .",

  "/wiki/Carousel": "A carousel ( American English : from French carrousel and Italian carosello ) , roundabout ( British English ) , or merry-go-round , is a type of amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders . The seats are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts , many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping , to the accompaniment of looped circus music . [ citation needed ] This leads to one of the alternative American names , the galloper ( however see direction of rotation below ) . Other popular names are jumper , horseabout , and flying horses . [ citation needed ] Carousels are commonly populated with horses , each horse weighing roughly 100 lbs ( 45 kg ) , but may include a variety of mounts , for example pigs , zebras , tigers , or mythological creatures such as dragons or unicorns . Sometimes , chair-like or bench-like seats are used , and occasionally mounts can be shaped like aeroplanes or cars . The roundabouts or merry-go-rounds installed in playgrounds are usually somewhat different devices : simple , child-powered rotating platforms with bars or handles to which children can cling while riding .",
  "/wiki/NRHP": "The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the United States federal government 's official list of districts , sites , buildings , structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance . A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians . Occasionally , historic sites outside the country proper , but associated with the United States ( such as the American Embassy in Tangiers ) are also listed .",
  "/wiki/Wurlitzer": "The Rudolph Wurlitzer Company , usually referred to as simply Wurlitzer , is an American company started in Cincinnati in 1853 by German immigrant ( Franz ) Rudolph Wurlitzer . The company initially imported stringed , woodwind and brass instruments from Germany for resale in the United States . Wurlitzer enjoyed initial success , largely due to defense contracts to provide musical instruments to the U.S. military . In 1880 , the company began manufacturing pianos and eventually relocated to North Tonawanda , New York . It quickly expanded to make band organs , orchestrions , player pianos and pipe or theatre organs popular in theatres during the days of silent movies . Wurlitzer is most known for their production of entry level pianos . During the 1960s , they manufactured Spinet , Console , Studio and Grand Pianos . Over time , Wurlitzer acquired a number of other companies which made a variety of loosely related products , including kitchen appliances , carnival rides , player piano rolls and radios . Wurlitzer also operated a chain of retail stores where the company 's products were sold . As technology evolved , Wurlitzer began producing electric pianos , electronic organs and jukeboxes , and it eventually became known more for jukeboxes and vending machines , which are still made by Wurlitzer , rather than for actual musical instruments . Wurlitzer 's jukebox operations were sold and moved to Germany in 1973 . The Wurlitzer piano and organ brands and U.S. manufacturing facilities were acquired by the Baldwin Piano & Organ Co. ( commonly called the Baldwin Piano Company ) in 1988 , and most piano manufacturing moved overseas .",

  "/wiki/Gondola_lift": "A gondola lift ( coming from Italian Language ) is a means of cable transport and type of aerial lift which is supported and propelled by cables from above . It consists of a loop of steel cable that is strung between two stations , sometimes over intermediate supporting towers . The cable is driven by a bullwheel in a terminal , which is typically connected to an engine or electric motor . They are often considered continuous systems since they feature a haul rope which continuously moves and circulates around two terminal stations . Depending on the combination of cables used for support and/or haulage and the type of grip ( detachable grip vs. fixed grip ) , the capacity , cost , and functionality of a gondola lift will differ dramatically . Because of the proliferation of such systems in the Alpine regions of Europe , the Italian language name of Teleferica Telecabina Funicolare ( Neapolitan Language ) or the French language name of T\u00e9l\u00e9cabine are also used in an English language and many others context .",

The rides are manufactured by Larson International of Plainview , Texas . The Tilt-A-Whirl consists of seven freely-spinning cars that hold three or four riders each , which are attached at fixed pivot points on a rotating platform . As the platform rotates , parts of the platform are raised and lowered , with the resulting centrifugal and gravitational forces on the cars causing them to spin in different directions and at variable speeds . The weight of passengers in these cars ( as well as the weight distribution ) may intensify or dampen the spinning motion of the cars , adding to the unpredictable nature of the motion ."
