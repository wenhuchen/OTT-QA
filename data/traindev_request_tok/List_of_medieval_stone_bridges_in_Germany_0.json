The affected area extended to Carinthia and northern Italy . It appears that after a prolonged hot and dry period continuous rainfalls occurred which lasted several consecutive days and amounted to more than half of the mean yearly precipitation . Since the dry soil was unable to absorb such amounts of water , the surface runoff washed away large areas of fertile soil and caused huge inundations destroying houses , mills and bridges .

After an initial provisional reconstruction , the middle part of the bridge was replaced by a steel through truss bridge and placed in operation again on 15 September 1965 . In 2006 , the Alte Br\u00fccke received a new porticus , which resembles a watermill that had historically been present at the bridge . Today , the view of the bridge is characterized by four portal walls at both sides of the bridge 's middle part . These have been built in the course of a complete renovation in 2014 .",
