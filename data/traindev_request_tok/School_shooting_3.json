  "/wiki/Flamethrower": "A flamethrower is a mechanical incendiary device designed to project a long , controllable stream of fire . First deployed by the Greeks in the 1st century CE , flamethrowers saw use in modern times during World War I , and more widely in World War II . Most military flamethrowers use flammable liquids thickened into a consistency similar to napalm , but commercial flamethrowers generally use high-pressure propane and gasoline ; such mobile liquids and gases are safer in peacetime applications , because their flames dissipate faster and often are easier to extinguish when necessary , because they are volatile and their liquid residues soak into porous media such as dry soil . In contrast , a military flamethrower 's viscous or gelled fuel sticks to the surfaces of its targets and is harder to dissipate with water , so it easily re-ignites after the flame has been extinguished . It also spreads less than mobile fluids , so that it permits a more manageably targeted burn . From the military point of view , when flamethrower fuel burns in a confined space such as a tunnel or dugout , its effects go beyond the threat of burning ; it quickly consumes the enclosed oxygen and pollutes the air within , so that smoke inhalation and asphyxiation may be as effective a weapon as the actual flames . Apart from the military applications , flamethrowers have peacetime applications where there is a need for controlled burning , such as in sugarcane harvesting and other land-management tasks . Various forms are designed for an operator to carry , while others are mounted on vehicles .",
  "/wiki/Spear": "A spear is a pole weapon consisting of a shaft , usually of wood , with a pointed head . The head may be simply the sharpened end of the shaft itself , as is the case with fire hardened spears , or it may be made of a more durable material fastened to the shaft , such as flint , obsidian , iron , steel or bronze . The most common design for hunting or combat spears since ancient times has incorporated a metal spearhead shaped like a triangle , lozenge , or leaf . The heads of fishing spears usually feature barbs or serrated edges . The word spear comes from the Old English spere , from the Proto-Germanic speri , from a Proto-Indo-European root *sper- spear , pole . Spears can be divided into two broad categories : those designed for thrusting in melee combat and those designed for throwing ( usually referred to as javelins ) . The spear has been used throughout human history both as a hunting and fishing tool and as a weapon . Along with the axe , knife and club , it is one of the earliest and most important tools developed by early humans . As a weapon , it may be wielded with either one hand or two . It was used in virtually every conflict up until the modern era , where even then it continues on in the form of the fixed bayonet , and is probably the most commonly used weapon in history .",

  "/wiki/Bullying": "Bullying is the use of force , coercion , or threat , to abuse , aggressively dominate or intimidate . The behavior is often repeated and habitual . One essential prerequisite is the perception ( by the bully or by others ) of an imbalance of physical or social power . This imbalance distinguishes bullying from conflict . Bullying is a subcategory of aggressive behavior characterized by the following three minimum criteria : ( 1 ) hostile intent , ( 2 ) imbalance of power , and ( 3 ) repetition over a period of time . Bullying is the activity of repeated , aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual , physically , mentally , or emotionally . Bullying ranges from one-on-one , individual bullying through to group bullying , called mobbing , in which the bully may have one or more lieutenants who are willing to assist the primary bully in their bullying activities . Bullying in school and the workplace is also referred to as peer abuse . Robert W. Fuller has analyzed bullying in the context of rankism . The Swedish-Norwegian researcher Dan Olweus says bullying occurs when a person is exposed , repeatedly and over time , to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons , and that negative actions occur when a person intentionally inflicts injury or discomfort upon another person , through physical contact , through words or in other ways . Individual bullying is usually characterized by a person behaving in a certain way to gain power over another person .

  "/wiki/Sawed-off_shotgun": "A sawed-off shotgun also called a sawn-off shotgun and a short-barreled shotgun , is a type of shotgun with a shorter gun barrel - typically under 18 inches - and often a shortened or absent stock . Despite the colloquial term , barrels do not , strictly speaking , have to be shortened with a saw . Barrels can be manufactured at shorter lengths as an alternative to traditional , longer barrels . This makes them easier to transport due to their smaller profile and lighter weight . The design also makes the weapon easy to maneuver in cramped spaces , a feature sought by military close quarters combat units , law enforcement SWAT team users , and home defense purposes . As a result of the shorter barrel length , any sawed-off shotgun with a magazine tube will have its capacity reduced . In the 1930s , the United States , Britain and Canada mandated that a permit be required to own these firearms . They are subject to legal restrictions depending upon jurisdiction .
