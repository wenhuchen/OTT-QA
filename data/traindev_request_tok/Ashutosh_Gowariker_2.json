Primarily of Hindu , Muslim and Sikh faiths , they now live mostly in the Indian states of Haryana , Punjab , Delhi , Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh and the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Sindh . Traditionally involved in peasant agriculture , the Jat community saw radical social changes in the 17th century , when the Hindu Jats took up arms against the Mughal Empire during the late 17th and early 18th century . The Hindu Jat kingdom reached its zenith under Maharaja Suraj Mal of Bharatpur ( 1707-1763 ) . The Jat community of the Punjab region played an important role in the development of the martial Khalsa Panth of Sikhism ; they are more commonly known as the Jat Sikhs .
