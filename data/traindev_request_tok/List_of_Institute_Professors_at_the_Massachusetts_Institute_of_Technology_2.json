  "/wiki/Carbon_nanotubes": "Carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) are tubes made of carbon with diameters typically measured in nanometers . Carbon nanotubes often refers to single-wall carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs ) with diameters in the range of a nanometer . They were discovered independently by Iijima and Ichihashi and Bethune et al . in carbon arc chambers similar to those used to produce fullerenes . Single-wall carbon nanotubes are one of the allotropes of carbon , intermediate between fullerene cages and flat graphene . Although not made this way , single-wall carbon nanotubes can be thought of as cutouts from a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms rolled up along one of the Bravais lattice vectors of the hexagonal lattice to form a hollow cylinder . In this construction , periodic boundary conditions are imposed over the length of this roll up vector to yield a lattice with helical symmetry of seamlessly bonded carbon atoms on the cylinder surface . Carbon nanotubes also often refer to multi-wall carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) consisting of nested single-wall carbon nanotubes . If not identical , these tubes are very similar to Oberlin , Endo and Koyama 's long straight and parallel carbon layers cylindrically rolled around a hollow tube . Multi-wall carbon nanotubes are also sometimes used to refer to double- and triple-wall carbon nanotubes . Carbon nanotubes can also refer to tubes with an undetermined carbon-wall structure and diameters less than 100 nanometers . Such tubes were discovered by Radushkevich and Lukyanovich .",

  "/wiki/Control_theory": "Control theory in control systems engineering is a subfield of mathematics that deals with the control of continuously operating dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines . The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without delay or overshoot and ensuring control stability . To do this , a controller with the requisite corrective behaviour is required . This controller monitors the controlled process variable ( PV ) , and compares it with the reference or set point ( SP ) . The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable , called the error signal , or SP-PV error , is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point . Other aspects which are also studied are controllability and observability . This is the basis for the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing , aircraft , communications and other industries . This is feedback control , which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range by means of a final control element , such as a control valve . Extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the block diagram . In it the transfer function , also known as the system function or network function , is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the differential equations describing the system . Control theory dates from the 19th century , when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by James Clerk Maxwell . Control theory was further advanced by Edward Routh in 1874 , Charles Sturm and in 1895 , Adolf Hurwitz , who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria ; and from 1922 onwards , the development of PID control theory by Nicolas Minorsky .",
  "/wiki/Computer_numerical_control": "Numerical control ( also computer numerical control , and commonly called CNC ) is the automated control of machining tools ( drills , boring tools , lathes ) and 3D printers by means of a computer . A CNC machine processes a piece of material ( metal , plastic , wood , ceramic , or composite ) to meet specifications by following a coded programmed instruction and without a manual operator . A CNC machine is a motorized maneuverable tool and often a motorized maneuverable platform , which are both controlled by a computer , according to specific input instructions . Instructions are delivered to a CNC machine in the form of a sequential program of machine control instructions such as G-code and then executed . The program can be written by a person or , far more often , generated by graphical computer-aided design ( CAD ) software . In the case of 3D printers , the part to be printed is sliced , before the instructions ( or the program ) is generated . 3D printers also use G-Code . CNC is a vast improvement over non-computerized machining that must be manually controlled ( e.g. , using devices such as hand wheels or levers ) or mechanically controlled by pre-fabricated pattern guides ( cams ) . In modern CNC systems , the design of a mechanical part and its manufacturing program is highly automated . The part 's mechanical dimensions are defined using CAD software and then translated into manufacturing directives by computer-aided manufacturing ( CAM ) software . The resulting directives are transformed ( by post processor software ) into the specific commands necessary for a particular machine to produce the component , and then are loaded into the CNC machine . Since any particular component might require the use of a number of different tools - drills , saws , etc .",

  "/wiki/Crystallography": "Crystallography is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids ( see crystal structure ) . The word crystallography is derived from the Greek words crystallon cold drop , frozen drop , with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency , and graphein to write . In July 2012 , the United Nations recognised the importance of the science of crystallography by proclaiming that 2014 would be the International Year of Crystallography . Before the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography ( see below ) , the study of crystals was based on physical measurements of their geometry using a goniometer . This involved measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to each other and to theoretical reference axes ( crystallographic axes ) , and establishing the symmetry of the crystal in question . The position in 3D space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereographic net such as a Wulff net or Lambert net . The pole to each face is plotted on the net . Each point is labelled with its Miller index . The final plot allows the symmetry of the crystal to be established . Crystallographic methods now depend on analysis of the diffraction patterns of a sample targeted by a beam of some type . X-rays are most commonly used ; other beams used include electrons or neutrons . Crystallographers often explicitly state the type of beam used , as in the terms X-ray crystallography , neutron diffraction and electron diffraction .",

  "/wiki/Metallurgy": "Metallurgy is a domain of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements , their inter-metallic compounds , and their mixtures , which are called alloys . Metallurgy encompasses both the science and the technology of metals . That is , the way in which science is applied to the production of metals , and the engineering of metal components used in products for both consumers and manufacturers . Metallurgy is distinct from the craft of metalworking . Metalworking relies on metallurgy in a similar manner to how medicine relies on medical science for technical advancement . A specialist practitioner of metallurgy is known as a Metallurgist . The science of metallurgy is subdivided into two broad categories : chemical metallurgy and physical metallurgy . Chemical metallurgy is chiefly concerned with the reduction and oxidation of metals , and the chemical performance of metals . Subjects of study in chemical metallurgy include mineral processing , the extraction of metals , thermodynamics , electrochemistry , and chemical degradation ( corrosion ) . In contrast , physical metallurgy focuses on the mechanical properties of metals , the physical properties of metals , and the physical performance of metals . Topics studied in physical metallurgy include crystallography , material characterization , mechanical metallurgy , phase transformations , and failure mechanisms . Historically , metallurgy has predominately focused on the production of metals .",
  "/wiki/Steel": "Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon , and sometimes other elements . Because of its high tensile strength and low cost , it is a major component used in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , trains , automobiles , machines , appliances , and weapons . Iron is the base metal of steel . Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms ( allotropic forms ) , body centered cubic and face-centered cubic , depending on its temperature . In the body-centered cubic arrangement , there is an iron atom in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell ; in the face-centered cubic , there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices . It is the interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements , primarily carbon , that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties . In pure iron , the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another , and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easily formed . In steel , small amounts of carbon , other elements , and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations . The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14% of its weight . Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements , as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel ( either as solute elements , or as precipitated phases ) , slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile , and thus controls and enhances its qualities . These qualities include the hardness , quenching behavior , need for annealing , tempering behavior , yield strength , and tensile strength of the resulting steel . The increase in steel 's strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing iron 's ductility .",

  "/wiki/Gyro_gunsight": "A gyro gunsight ( G.G.S . ) is a modification of the non-magnifying reflector sight in which target lead ( the amount of aim-off in front of a moving target ) and bullet drop are calculated automatically . The first examples were developed in Britain just before the Second World War for use during aerial combat , and more advanced models were common on Allied aircraft by the end of the war . The amount of lead required to hit a target is a function of the rate of turn of the attacking aircraft and the range to the target . The former is measured using a gyroscope in the sight , while the later is estimated by the pilot by moving a dial or pointer so that a reticle in the sight matches the wingspan of the target . Post-war models added a small radar to automate the range measurement ; these are known as radar gunsights . Gyro sights usually contained more than one reticle to assist in proper aiming : a fixed one , often just a dot , signifying the direction the guns are pointing , a moving one showing the corrected aiming point , and a ring to match to a target plane 's known wingspan . A particularly advanced model , the K-14 found in the North American P-51 Mustang , had separate projectors and displays for air and ground attacks .",

High-speed photography can be considered to be the opposite of time-lapse photography . In common usage , high-speed photography may refer to either or both of the following meanings . The first is that the photograph itself may be taken in a way as to appear to freeze the motion , especially to reduce motion blur . The second is that a series of photographs may be taken at a high sampling frequency or frame rate . The first requires a sensor with good sensitivity and either a very good shuttering system or a very fast strobe light . The second requires some means of capturing successive frames , either with a mechanical device or by moving data off electronic sensors very quickly .

  "/wiki/Nuclear_reaction": "In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry , a nuclear reaction is semantically considered to be the process in which two nuclei , or else a nucleus of an atom and a subatomic particle ( such as a proton , neutron , or high energy electron ) from outside the atom , collide to produce one or more nuclides that are different from the nuclide ( s ) that began the process ( parent nuclei ) . Thus , a nuclear reaction must cause a transformation of at least one nuclide to another . If a nucleus interacts with another nucleus or particle and they then separate without changing the nature of any nuclide , the process is simply referred to as a type of nuclear scattering , rather than a nuclear reaction . In principle , a reaction can involve more than two particles colliding , but because the probability of three or more nuclei to meet at the same time at the same place is much less than for two nuclei , such an event is exceptionally rare ( see triple alpha process for an example very close to a three-body nuclear reaction ) . The term nuclear reaction may refer either to a change in a nuclide induced by collision with another particle , or to a spontaneous change of a nuclide without collision . Natural nuclear reactions occur in the interaction between cosmic rays and matter , and nuclear reactions can be employed artificially to obtain nuclear energy , at an adjustable rate , on demand . Perhaps the most notable nuclear reactions are the nuclear chain reactions in fissionable materials that produce induced nuclear fission , and the various nuclear fusion reactions of light elements that power the energy production of the Sun and stars .",

  "/wiki/Optical_communications": "Optical communication , also known as optical telecommunication , is communication at a distance using light to carry information . It can be performed visually or by using electronic devices . The earliest basic forms of optical communication date back several millennia , while the earliest electrical device created to do so was the photophone , invented in 1880 . An optical communication system uses a transmitter , which encodes a message into an optical signal , a channel , which carries the signal to its destination , and a receiver , which reproduces the message from the received optical signal . When electronic equipment is not employed the 'receiver ' is a person visually observing and interpreting a signal , which may be either simple ( such as the presence of a beacon fire ) or complex ( such as lights using color codes or flashed in a Morse code sequence ) . Free-space optical communication has been deployed in space , while terrestrial forms are naturally limited by geography , weather and the availability of light .

  "/wiki/Dielectric": "A dielectric ( or dielectric material ) is an electrical insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric field . When a dielectric material is placed in an electric field , electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing dielectric polarization . Because of dielectric polarization , positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field and negative charges shift in the direction opposite to the field ( for example , if the field is moving in the positive x-axis , the negative charges will shift in the negative x-axis ) . This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself . If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules , those molecules not only become polarized , but also reorient so that their symmetry axes align to the field . The study of dielectric properties concerns storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic energy in materials . Dielectrics are important for explaining various phenomena in electronics , optics , solid-state physics , and cell biophysics .",

A pioneer of structural linguistics , Jakobson was one of the most celebrated and influential linguists of the twentieth century . With Nikolai Trubetzkoy , he developed revolutionary new techniques for the analysis of linguistic sound systems , in effect founding the modern discipline of phonology . Jakobson went on to extend similar principles and techniques to the study of other aspects of language such as syntax , morphology and semantics . He made numerous contributions to Slavic linguistics , most notably two studies of Russian case and an analysis of the categories of the Russian verb . Drawing on insights from C. S. Peirce 's semiotics , as well as from communication theory and cybernetics , he proposed methods for the investigation of poetry , music , the visual arts , and cinema . Through his decisive influence on Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss and Roland Barthes , among others , Jakobson became a pivotal figure in the adaptation of structural analysis to disciplines beyond linguistics , including philosophy , anthropology , and literary theory ; his development of the approach pioneered by Ferdinand de Saussure , known as structuralism , became a major post-war intellectual movement in Europe and the United States . Meanwhile , though the influence of structuralism declined during the 1970s , Jakobson 's work has continued to receive attention in linguistic anthropology , especially through the ethnography of communication developed by Dell Hymes and the semiotics of culture developed by Jakobson 's former student Michael Silverstein .

Originally , a Slavist ( from Russian \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0442 or Polish slawista ) or Slavicist was primarily a linguist or philologist researching Slavistics , a Slavic ( AmE ) or Slavonic ( BrE ) scholar . Increasingly historians and other humanists and social scientists who study Slavic area cultures and societies have been included in this rubric . In North America , Slavic studies are dominated by Russian studies ; Ewa Thompson describes the situation of non-Russian Slavic studies as Invisible and Mute .",
  "/wiki/Linguistics": "Linguistics is the scientific study of language . It involves analysing language form , language meaning , and language in context . Linguists traditionally analyse human language by observing an interplay between sound and meaning . Linguistics also deals with the social , cultural , historical and political factors that influence language , through which linguistic and language-based context is often determined . Research on language through the sub-branches of historical and evolutionary linguistics also focuses on how languages change and grow , particularly over an extended period of time . The earliest activities in the documentation and description of language have been attributed to the 6th-century-BC Indian grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini who wrote a formal description of the Sanskrit language in his A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b . Related areas of study include the disciplines of semiotics ( the study of direct and indirect language through signs and symbols ) , literary criticism ( the historical and ideological analysis of literature , cinema , art , or published material ) , translation ( the conversion and documentation of meaning in written/spoken text from one language or dialect onto another ) , and speech-language pathology ( a corrective method to cure phonetic disabilities and dis-functions at the cognitive level ) .",
  "/wiki/Russian_formalism": "Russian formalism was a school of literary criticism in Russia from the 1910s to the 1930s . It includes the work of a number of highly influential Russian and Soviet scholars such as Viktor Shklovsky , Yuri Tynianov , Vladimir Propp , Boris Eichenbaum , Roman Jakobson , Boris Tomashevsky , Grigory Gukovsky who revolutionised literary criticism between 1914 and the 1930s by establishing the specificity and autonomy of poetic language and literature . Russian formalism exerted a major influence on thinkers like Mikhail Bakhtin and Yuri Lotman , and on structuralism as a whole . The movement 's members had a relevant influence on modern literary criticism , as it developed in the structuralist and post-structuralist periods . Under Stalin it became a pejorative term for elitist art . Russian formalism was a diverse movement , producing no unified doctrine , and no consensus amongst its proponents on a central aim to their endeavours . In fact , Russian Formalism describes two distinct movements : the OPOJAZ ( Obshchestvo Izucheniia Poeticheskogo Yazyka , Society for the Study of Poetic Language ) in St. Petersburg and the Moscow Linguistic Circle . Therefore , it is more precise to refer to the Russian Formalists , rather than to use the more encompassing and abstract term of Formalism . The term formalism was first used by the adversaries of the movement , and as such it conveys a meaning explicitly rejected by the Formalists themselves . In the words of one of the foremost Formalists , Boris Eichenbaum : It is difficult to recall who coined this name , but it was not a very felicitous coinage . It might have been convenient as a simplified battle cry but it fails , as an objective term , to delimit the activities of the Society for the Study of Poetic Language .",

  "/wiki/Bauhaus": "The Staatliches Bauhaus ( German : [ \u02c8\u0283ta\u02d0tl\u026a\u00e7\u0259s \u02c8ba\u028a\u02ccha\u028as ] ( listen ) ) , commonly known as the Bauhaus , was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts . The school became famous for its approach to design , which strove to combine beauty with usefulness and attempted to unify the principles of mass production with individual artistic vision . The Bauhaus was founded by architect Walter Gropius in Weimar . The German term Bauhaus - literally building house - was understood as meaning School of Building , but in spite of its name the Bauhaus did not initially have an architecture department . Nonetheless , it was founded upon the idea of creating a Gesamtkunstwerk ( 'total ' work of art ) in which all the arts , including architecture , would eventually be brought together . The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design , Modernist architecture and art , design , and architectural education . The Bauhaus movement had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art , architecture , graphic design , interior design , industrial design , and typography . The school existed in three German cities - Weimar , from 1919 to 1925 ; Dessau , from 1925 to 1932 ; and Berlin , from 1932 to 1933 - under three different architect-directors : Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1928 ; Hannes Meyer from 1928 to 1930 ; and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933 , when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime , having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism . Although the school was closed , the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world . The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus , technique , instructors , and politics . For example , the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau , even though it had been an important revenue source ; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930 , he transformed it into a private school and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it .",
  "/wiki/Norman_Levinson": "Norman Levinson ( August 11 , 1912 in Lynn , Massachusetts - October 10 , 1975 in Boston ) was an American mathematician . Some of his major contributions were in the study of Fourier transforms , complex analysis , non-linear differential equations , number theory , and signal processing . He worked closely with Norbert Wiener in his early career . He joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1937 . In 1954 , he was awarded the B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize of the American Mathematical Society and in 1971 the Chauvenet Prize ( after winning in 1970 the Lester R. Ford Award ) of the Mathematical Association of America for his paper A Motivated Account of an Elementary Proof of the Prime Number Theorem . In 1974 he published a paper proving that more than a third of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line , a result later improved to two fifths by Conrey . He received both his bachelor 's degree and his master 's degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1934 , where he had studied under Norbert Wiener and took almost all of the graduate-level courses in mathematics . He received the MIT Redfield Proctor Traveling Fellowship to study at the University of Cambridge , with the assurance that MIT would reward him with a Ph.D. upon his return regardless of whatever he produced at Cambridge . Within the first four months in Cambridge , he had already produced two papers . In 1935 , MIT awarded him with the Ph.D. in mathematics . His death in 1975 was caused by a brain tumor . He was married since 1938 ; his widow Zipporah died at age 93 in 2009 , survived by two daughters and four grandchildren .",
  "/wiki/Differential_equations": "In mathematics , a differential equation is an equation that relates one or more functions and their derivatives . In applications , the functions generally represent physical quantities , the derivatives represent their rates of change , and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two . Because such relations are extremely common , differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering , physics , economics , and biology . The study of differential equations consists mainly of the study of their solutions ( the set of functions that satisfy the equation ) , and of the properties of their solutions . Only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas ; however , many properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without computing them exactly . If a closed-form expression for the solutions is not available , the solutions may be numerically approximated using computers . The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations , while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy .",

The HUAC was created in 1938 to investigate alleged disloyalty and subversive activities on the part of private citizens , public employees , and those organizations suspected of having Communist ties . When the House abolished the committee in 1975 , its functions were transferred to the House Judiciary Committee . The committee 's anti-communist investigations are often compared with those of Joseph McCarthy who , as a U.S . Senator , had no direct involvement with this House committee .

  "/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics": "Condensed matter physics is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of matter . In particular it is concerned with the condensed phases that appear whenever the number of constituents in a system is extremely large and the interactions between the constituents are strong . The most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids , which arise from the electromagnetic forces between atoms . Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws . In particular , they include the laws of quantum mechanics , electromagnetism and statistical mechanics . More exotic condensed phases include the superconducting phase exhibited by certain materials at low temperature , the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on crystal lattices of atoms , and the Bose-Einstein condensate found in ultracold atomic systems . The study of condensed matter physics involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using methods of theoretical physics to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior . The diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary physics : one third of all American physicists self-identify as condensed matter physicists , and the Division of Condensed Matter Physics is the largest division at the American Physical Society . The field overlaps with chemistry , materials science , and nanotechnology , and relates closely to atomic physics and biophysics . The theoretical physics of condensed matter shares important concepts and methods with that of particle physics and nuclear physics . A variety of topics in physics such as crystallography , metallurgy , elasticity , magnetism , etc. , were treated as distinct areas until the 1940s , when they were grouped together as solid state physics . Around the 1960s , the study of physical properties of liquids was added to this list , forming the basis for the new , related specialty of condensed matter physics .",
