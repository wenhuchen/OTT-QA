  "/wiki/Radio_Corporation_of_America": "The RCA Corporation was a major American electronics company , which was founded as the Radio Corporation of America in 1919 . It was initially a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric ( GE ) ; however , in 1932 , RCA became an independent company after GE was required to divest its ownership as part of the settlement of a government antitrust suit . An innovative and progressive company , RCA was the dominant electronics and communications firm in the United States for over five decades . RCA was at the forefront of the mushrooming radio industry in the early 1920s , as a major manufacturer of radio receivers , and the exclusive manufacturer of the first superheterodyne models . RCA also created the first nationwide American radio network , the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) . The company was also a pioneer in the introduction and development of television , both black-and-white and especially , color television . During this period , RCA was closely identified with the leadership of David Sarnoff . He was general manager at the company 's founding , became president in 1930 , and remained active , as chairman of the board , until the end of 1969 . During the 1970s , RCA 's seemingly impregnable stature began to weaken as it attempted to expand from its main focus of the development and marketing of consumer electronics into a diversified multinational conglomerate . The company suffered enormous financial losses in the mainframe computer industry and other failed projects such as the CED videodisc . Though the company rebounded by the mid 1980s , RCA was reacquired by General Electric in 1986 , which over the next few years liquidated most of the corporation 's assets .

He is best known to the general public for his mass-energy equivalence formula E = m c 2 { \\displaystyle E=mc^ { 2 } } , which has been dubbed the world 's most famous equation . He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect , a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory . Near the beginning of his career , Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field . This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern ( 1902-1909 ) . He subsequently realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields , and published a paper on general relativity in 1916 introducing his theory of gravitation . He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory , which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules . He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation , the basis of laser , which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light . In 1917 , he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe . Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895 and renounced his German citizenship in 1896 . After being stateless for more than five years , he acquired Swiss citizenship in 1901 , which he kept for the rest of his life .",

  "/wiki/Alfred_Vail": "Alfred Lewis Vail ( September 25 , 1807 - January 18 , 1859 ) was an American machinist and inventor . Along with Samuel Morse , Vail was central in developing and commercializing American telegraphy between 1837 and 1844 . Vail and Morse were the first two telegraph operators on Morse 's first experimental line between Washington , DC , and Baltimore , and Vail took charge of building and managing several early telegraph lines between 1845 and 1848 . He was also responsible for several technical innovations of Morse 's system , particularly the sending key and improved recording registers and relay magnets . Vail left the telegraph industry in 1848 because he believed that the managers of Morse 's lines did not fully value his contributions .

  "/wiki/Telegraph": "Telegraphy is the long-distance transmission of textual messages where the sender uses symbolic codes , known to the recipient , rather than a physical exchange of an object bearing the message . Thus flag semaphore is a method of telegraphy , whereas pigeon post is not . Ancient signalling systems , although sometimes quite extensive and sophisticated as in China , were generally not capable of transmitting arbitrary text messages . Possible messages were fixed and predetermined and such systems are thus not true telegraphs . The earliest true telegraph put into widespread use was the optical telegraph of Claude Chappe , invented in the late 18th century . The system was extensively used in France , and European countries controlled by France , during the Napoleonic era . The electric telegraph started to replace the optical telegraph in the mid-19th century . It was first taken up in Britain in the form of the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph , initially used mostly as an aid to railway signalling . This was quickly followed by a different system developed in the United States by Samuel Morse . The electric telegraph was slower to develop in France due to the established optical telegraph system , but an electrical telegraph was put into use with a code compatible with the Chappe optical telegraph . The Morse system was adopted as the international standard in 1865 , using a modified Morse code developed in Germany . The heliograph is a telegraph system using reflected sunlight for signalling .",

In 1977 benzodiazepines were globally the most prescribed medications . They are in the family of drugs commonly known as minor tranquilizers . Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) at the GABAA receptor , resulting in sedative , hypnotic ( sleep-inducing ) , anxiolytic ( anti-anxiety ) , anticonvulsant , and muscle relaxant properties . High doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines may also cause anterograde amnesia and dissociation . These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety , insomnia , agitation , seizures , muscle spasms , alcohol withdrawal and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures . Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short , intermediary , or long-acting . Short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia ; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety . Benzodiazepines are generally viewed as safe and effective for short-term use , although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur . A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic . Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide .",

After World War II , an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain , and television sets became commonplace in homes , businesses , and institutions . During the 1950s , television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion . In the mid-1960s , color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries . The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes , high-capacity hard disk drives , DVDs , flash drives , high-definition Blu-ray Discs , and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material - such as movies - at home on their own time schedule .

They may be used singly or linked together electronically in an array . Unlike optical telescopes , radio telescopes can be used in the daytime as well as at night . Since astronomical radio sources such as planets , stars , nebulas and galaxies are very far away , the radio waves coming from them are extremely weak , so radio telescopes require very large antennas to collect enough radio energy to study them , and extremely sensitive receiving equipment . Radio observatories are preferentially located far from major centers of population to avoid electromagnetic interference ( EMI ) from radio , television , radar , motor vehicles , and other man-made electronic devices . Radio waves from space were first detected by engineer Karl Guthe Jansky in 1932 at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel , New Jersey using an antenna built to study noise in radio receivers . The first purpose-built radio telescope was a 9-meter parabolic dish constructed by radio amateur Grote Reber in his back yard in Wheaton , Illinois in 1937 . The sky survey he did with it is often considered the beginning of the field of radio astronomy .",
  "/wiki/Bell_Labs": "Nokia Bell Labs ( formerly named Bell Labs Innovations ( 1996-2007 ) , AT & T Bell Laboratories ( 1984-1996 ) and Bell Telephone Laboratories ( 1925-1984 ) ) is an industrial research and scientific development company owned by Finnish company Nokia . With headquarters located in Murray Hill , New Jersey , the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world . Bell Labs has its origins in the complex past of the Bell System . In the late 19th century , the laboratory began as the Western Electric Engineering Department and was located at 463 West Street in New York City . In 1925 , after years of conducting research and development under Western Electric , the Engineering Department was reformed into Bell Telephone Laboratories and under the shared ownership of American Telephone & Telegraph Company and Western Electric . Researchers working at Bell Labs are credited with the development of radio astronomy , the transistor , the laser , the photovoltaic cell , the charge-coupled device ( CCD ) , information theory , the Unix operating system , and the programming languages C , C++ , and S.

  "/wiki/Video_camera_tube": "Video camera tubes were devices based on the cathode ray tube that were used to capture television images prior to the introduction of charge-coupled device ( CCD ) image sensors in the 1980s . Several different types of tubes were in use from the early 1930s to the 1980s . In these tubes , the cathode ray was scanned across an image of the scene to be broadcast . The resultant current was dependent on the brightness of the image on the target . The size of the striking ray was tiny compared to the size of the target , allowing 483 horizontal scan lines per image in the NTSC format , or 576 lines in PAL .",
  "/wiki/Paul_K._Weimer": "Dr. Paul K. Weimer ( November 5 , 1914 - January 6 , 2005 ) was a noted contributor to the development of television and the thin-film transistor ( TFT ) . Weimer was born in Wabash , Indiana . He received a B.A . in math and physics from Manchester University ( Indiana ) in 1936 , an M.A . in physics from the University of Kansas in 1938 , and a Ph.D. in physics from Ohio State University in 1942 . He then joined the RCA laboratory in Princeton , New Jersey , where he worked until retirement in 1981 . His first assignment was to develop an electron multiplier to go with the Image Orthicon . This tube , which proved to be 100 times more sensitive than its predecessors , was used for the first 20 years of television broadcasting in the United States . In 1961 , Weimer began making thin-film transistors in a coplanar process on glass substrates . In a typical process , he would deposit a gold source and drain , then deposit polycrystalline semiconductor material , and place a gate on top . After he placed an insulator between the gate and semiconductor , he got excellent results , as published in his 1962 paper , The TFT : A New Thin-Film Transistor , in the Proceedings of the IRE . Weimer held over 90 patents , and was a member of the National Academy of Engineering and fellow of the Institute for Radio Engineers .",
  "/wiki/Thin-film_transistor": "A thin-film transistor ( TFT ) is a special type of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor ( MOSFET ) made by depositing thin films of an active semiconductor layer as well as the dielectric layer and metallic contacts over a supporting ( but non-conducting ) substrate . A common substrate is glass , because the primary application of TFTs is in liquid-crystal displays ( LCDs ) . This differs from the conventional bulk MOSFET transistor , where the semiconductor material typically is the substrate , such as a silicon wafer .",
  "/wiki/John_H._Sinfelt": "John H. Sinfelt ( February 18 , 1931 in Munson , Clearfield County , Pennsylvania - May 28 , 2011 in Morristown , New Jersey ) was an American chemical engineer whose research on catalytic reforming was responsible for the introduction of unleaded gasoline .

He later patented that method .",
  "/wiki/Unleaded_gasoline": "Gasoline ( American English ) , or petrol ( British English ) , is a clear petroleum-derived flammable liquid that is used primarily as a fuel in most spark-ignited internal combustion engines . It consists mostly of organic compounds obtained by the fractional distillation of petroleum , enhanced with a variety of additives . On average , a 42-U.S.-gallon ( 160-liter ) barrel of crude oil yields about 19 U.S. gallons ( 72 liters ) of gasoline ( among other refined products ) after processing in an oil refinery , though this varies based on the crude oil assay . The characteristic of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early ( which causes knocking and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines ) is measured by its octane rating which is produced in several grades . Tetraethyl lead and other lead compounds are no longer used in most areas to increase octane rating ( still used in aviation and auto-racing ) . Other chemicals are frequently added to gasoline to improve chemical stability and performance characteristics , control corrosiveness and provide fuel system cleaning . Gasoline may contain oxygen-containing chemicals such as ethanol , MTBE or ETBE to improve combustion . Gasoline used in internal combustion engines can have significant effects on the local environment , and is also a contributor to global human carbon dioxide emissions . Gasoline can also enter the environment uncombusted , both as liquid and as vapor , from leakage and handling during production , transport and delivery ( e.g. , from storage tanks , from spills , etc. ) . As an example of efforts to control such leakage , many underground storage tanks are required to have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent such leaks . Gasoline contains benzene and other known carcinogens .",

  "/wiki/Electron_microscope": "An electron microscope is a microscope that uses a beam of accelerated electrons as a source of illumination . As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible light photons , electron microscopes have a higher resolving power than light microscopes and can reveal the structure of smaller objects . A scanning transmission electron microscope has achieved better than 50 pm resolution in annular dark-field imaging mode and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000\u00d7 whereas most light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200 nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000\u00d7 . Electron microscopes use shaped magnetic fields to form electron optical lens systems that are analogous to the glass lenses of an optical light microscope . Electron microscopes are used to investigate the ultrastructure of a wide range of biological and inorganic specimens including microorganisms , cells , large molecules , biopsy samples , metals , and crystals . Industrially , electron microscopes are often used for quality control and failure analysis . Modern electron microscopes produce electron micrographs using specialized digital cameras and frame grabbers to capture the images .",
