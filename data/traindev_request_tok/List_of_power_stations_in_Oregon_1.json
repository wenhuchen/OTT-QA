  "/wiki/Columbia_River": "The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America . The river rises in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia , Canada . It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington , then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean . The river is 1,243 miles ( 2,000 km ) long , and its largest tributary is the Snake River . Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province . The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume , the Columbia has the greatest flow of any North American river entering the Pacific . The Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region 's culture and economy for thousands of years . They have been used for transportation since ancient times , linking the region 's many cultural groups . The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish , which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline waters of the Pacific Ocean . These fish - especially the salmon species - provided the core subsistence for native peoples . In the late 18th century , a private American ship became the first non-indigenous vessel to enter the river ; it was followed by a British explorer , who navigated past the Oregon Coast Range into the Willamette Valley . In the following decades , fur trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route .",

The Snake River rises in western Wyoming , then flows through the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho , the rugged Hells Canyon on the Oregon-Idaho border and the rolling Palouse Hills of Washington , emptying into the Columbia River at the Tri-Cities , Washington . The Snake River drainage basin encompasses parts of six U.S. states and is known for its varied geologic history . The Snake River Plain was created by a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath the Snake River headwaters in Yellowstone National Park . Gigantic glacial-retreat flooding episodes that occurred during the previous Ice Age carved out canyons , cliffs and waterfalls along the middle and lower Snake River . Two of these catastrophic flooding events , the Missoula Floods and Bonneville Flood , significantly affected the river and its surroundings . Prehistoric Native Americans lived along the Snake starting more than 11,000 years ago . Salmon from the Pacific Ocean spawned by the millions in the river , and were a vital resource for people living on the Snake downstream of Shoshone Falls . By the time Lewis and Clark explored the area , the Nez Perce and Shoshone were the dominant Native American groups in the region . Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the Snake River basin . At one point , sign language used by the Shoshones representing weaving baskets was misinterpreted to represent a snake , giving the Snake River its name .",

  "/wiki/Rogue_River_(Oregon)": "The Rogue River ( Tolowa : yan-shuu-chit taa-ghii~-li~ , Takelma : tak-elam ) in southwestern Oregon in the United States flows about 215 miles ( 346 km ) in a generally westward direction from the Cascade Range to the Pacific Ocean . Known for its salmon runs , whitewater rafting , and rugged scenery , it was one of the original eight rivers named in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 . Beginning near Crater Lake , which occupies the caldera left by the explosive volcanic eruption of Mount Mazama , the river flows through the geologically young High Cascades and the older Western Cascades , another volcanic province . Further west , the river passes through multiple exotic terranes of the more ancient Klamath Mountains . In the Kalmiopsis Wilderness section of the Rogue basin are some of the world 's best examples of rocks that form the Earth 's mantle . Near the mouth of the river , the only dinosaur fragments ever discovered in Oregon were found in the Otter Point Formation , along the coast of Curry County . People have lived along the Rogue River and its tributaries for at least 8,500 years . European explorers made first contact with Native Americans ( Indians ) toward the end of the 18th century and began beaver trapping and other activities in the region . Clashes , sometimes deadly , occurred between the natives and the trappers and later between the natives and European-American miners and settlers . These struggles culminated with the Rogue River Wars of 1855-56 and removal of most of the natives to reservations outside the basin . After the war , settlers expanded into remote areas of the watershed and established small farms along the river between Grave Creek and the mouth of the Illinois River .

The Willamette 's main stem is 187 miles ( 301 km ) long , lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States . Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range , the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley , a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon 's population , including the state capital , Salem , and the state 's largest city , Portland , which surrounds the Willamette 's mouth at the Columbia . Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion , the river 's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age . Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago . There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia . Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well . Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades , the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America , and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail . The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century , although Willamette Falls , just upstream from Portland , was a major barrier to boat traffic . In the 21st century , major highways follow the river , and roads cross the main stem on approximately 30 different bridges . In addition to sharing some of those , more than half a dozen bridges not open to motorized vehicles provide separate crossings for bicycles and pedestrians ( mostly in the Eugene area ) , and several others are exclusively for rail traffic . There are also ferries that convey cars , trucks , motorcycles , bicycles , and pedestrians across the river for a fare and provided river conditions permit .",
