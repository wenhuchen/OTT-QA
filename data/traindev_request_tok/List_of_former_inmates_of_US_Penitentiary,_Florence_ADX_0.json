The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council .

It was designed by Ole Singstad and named after Abraham Lincoln . The tunnel consists of three vehicular tubes of varying lengths , with two traffic lanes in each tube . The center tube contains reversible lanes , while the northern and southern tubes exclusively carry westbound and eastbound traffic , respectively . The Lincoln Tunnel was originally proposed in the late 1920s and early 1930s as the Midtown Hudson Tunnel . The tubes of the Lincoln Tunnel were constructed in stages between 1934 and 1957 . Construction of the central tube , which originally lacked sufficient funding due to the Great Depression , started in 1934 and it opened in 1937 . The northern tube started construction in 1936 , was delayed due to World War II-related material shortages , and opened in 1945 . Although the original plans for the Lincoln Tunnel called for two tubes , a third tube to the south of the existing tunnels was planned in 1950 due to high traffic demand on the other two tubes . The third tube started construction in 1954 , with the delay attributed to disputes over tunnel approaches , and it opened in 1957 . Since then , the Lincoln Tunnel has undergone a series of gradual improvements , including changes to security and tolling methods .

The tunnel carries Interstate 78 ; the New Jersey side is also designated the eastern terminus of Route 139 . The Holland Tunnel is one of three vehicular crossings between Manhattan and New Jersey , the others being the Lincoln Tunnel and the George Washington Bridge . Plans for a fixed vehicular crossing over the Hudson River were first devised in 1906 . However , disagreements prolonged the planning process until 1919 , when it was decided to build a tunnel under the river . Construction of the Holland Tunnel started in 1920 , and it opened in 1927 . At the time of its opening , the Holland Tunnel was the longest continuous underwater vehicular tunnel in the world . The Holland Tunnel was originally known as the Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel or the Canal Street Tunnel . It was renamed the Holland Tunnel in memory of Clifford Milburn Holland , the chief engineer , following his sudden death in 1924 before the tunnel was opened . The Holland Tunnel was the world 's first mechanically ventilated tunnel ; the ventilation system was designed by Ole Singstad , who oversaw the tunnel 's completion .",

The idea of a bridge across the Hudson River was first proposed in 1906 , but it was not until 1925 that the state legislatures of New York and New Jersey voted to allow for the planning and construction of such a bridge . Construction on the George Washington Bridge started in October 1927 ; the bridge was ceremonially dedicated on October 24 , 1931 , and opened to traffic the next day . The opening of the George Washington Bridge contributed to the development of Bergen County , New Jersey , in which Fort Lee is located . The upper deck was widened from six to eight lanes in 1946 . The six-lane lower deck was constructed beneath the existing span from 1958 to 1962 because of increasing traffic flow . The George Washington Bridge is an important travel corridor within the New York metropolitan area .

  "/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse": "Child sexual abuse , also called child molestation , is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent uses a child for sexual stimulation . Forms of child sexual abuse include engaging in sexual activities with a child ( whether by asking or pressuring , or by other means ) , indecent exposure ( of the genitals , female nipples , etc . ) , child grooming , child sexual exploitation or using a child to produce child pornography . Child sexual abuse can occur in a variety of settings , including home , school , or work ( in places where child labor is common ) . Child marriage is one of the main forms of child sexual abuse ; UNICEF has stated that child marriage represents perhaps the most prevalent form of sexual abuse and exploitation of girls . The effects of child sexual abuse can include depression , post-traumatic stress disorder , anxiety , complex post-traumatic stress disorder , propensity to further victimization in adulthood , and physical injury to the child , among other problems . Sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest and can result in more serious and long-term psychological trauma , especially in the case of parental incest . The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males . Most sexual abuse offenders are acquainted with their victims ; approximately 30% are relatives of the child , most often brothers , fathers , uncles , or cousins ; around 60% are other acquaintances , such as friends of the family , babysitters , or neighbors ; strangers are the offenders in approximately 10% of child sexual abuse cases . Most child sexual abuse is committed by men ; studies on female child molesters show that women commit 14% to 40% of offenses reported against boys and 6% of offenses reported against girls . The word pedophile is commonly applied indiscriminately to anyone who sexually abuses a child , but child sexual offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a strong sexual interest in prepubescent children . Under the law , child sexual abuse is often used as an umbrella term describing criminal and civil offenses in which an adult engages in sexual activity with a minor or exploits a minor for the purpose of sexual gratification .",
  "/wiki/Rape": "Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person 's consent . The act may be carried out by physical force , coercion , abuse of authority , or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent , such as one who is unconscious , incapacitated , has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent . The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault . The rate of reporting , prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions . Internationally , the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged , per 100,000 people , from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median . Worldwide , rape is primarily committed by males against females . Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows , and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape . Widespread and systematic rape ( e.g. , war rape ) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict . These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes . Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a targeted ethnic group .

The asportation/abduction element is typically but not necessarily conducted by means of force or fear . That is , the perpetrator may use a weapon to force the victim into a vehicle , but it is still kidnapping if the victim is enticed to enter the vehicle willingly , e.g. , in the belief it is a taxicab . Kidnapping may be done to demand for ransom in exchange for releasing the victim , or for other illegal purposes . Kidnapping can be accompanied by bodily injury which elevates the crime to aggravated kidnapping .

He is known as the man who helped bring down John Gotti , the family 's boss , by agreeing to testify against him and other mobsters in a deal in which he confessed to involvement in nineteen murders . Originally a mobster for the Colombo crime family , and later for the Brooklyn faction of the Gambino family , Gravano was part of the group that conspired to murder Gambino boss Paul Castellano in 1985 . Gravano played a key role in planning and executing Castellano 's murder , along with Gotti , Angelo Ruggiero , Frank DeCicco , and Joseph Armone . Soon after Castellano 's death , Gotti elevated Gravano to underboss , a position Gravano held at the time he became a government witness . At the time , Gravano was the highest-ranking member of the Five Families to break his blood oath and cooperate with the government . As a result of his testimonies , Gotti and Frank Locascio were sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and a $ 250,000 fine , on June 23 , 1992 .

  "/wiki/Underboss": "Underboss ( Italian : sottocapo ) is a position within the leadership structure of certain organized crime groups , particularly in Sicilian , Greek , and Italian-American Mafia crime families . The underboss is second in command to the boss . The underboss is sometimes a family member , such as a son , who will take over the family if the boss is sick , killed , or imprisoned . However the position of street boss has somewhat challenged the rank of underboss in the modern era . The position was installed within the Genovese crime family since at least the mid 1960s . It has also been used in the Detroit crime family and the Chicago Outfit . The power of an underboss greatly varies ; some are marginal figures , while others are the most powerful individuals in the family . Traditionally they run day-to-day affairs of the family . In some crime families , the appointment is for life . If a new boss takes over a family with an existing underboss , that boss may marginalize or even murder the underboss appointed by his predecessor . On the other hand , if a boss is incarcerated , the underboss may become acting boss . As bosses often serve large periods of time in prison , an acting boss will often become the crime family 's effective boss .",

The group , which went through five bosses between 1910 and 1957 , is named after Carlo Gambino , boss of the family at the time of the McClellan hearings in 1963 , when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention . The group 's operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California . Its illicit activities include labor and construction racketeering , gambling , loansharking , extortion , money laundering , prostitution , fraud , hijacking , and fencing . The family was one of the five families that were founded in New York after the Castellammarese War of 1931 . For most of the next quarter-century , it was a minor player in organized crime . Its most prominent member during this time was its underboss Albert Anastasia , who rose to infamy as the operating head of the underworld 's enforcement arm , Murder , Inc . He remained in power even after Murder , Inc. was smashed in the late 1940s , and took over his family in 1951 - by all accounts , after murdering the family 's founder Vincent Mangano . The rise of what was the most powerful crime family in America for a time began in 1957 , when Anastasia was assassinated while sitting in a barber chair at the Park Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan . Experts believe that Anastasia 's underboss Carlo Gambino helped orchestrate the hit to take over the family . Gambino partnered with Meyer Lansky to control gambling interests in Cuba .

Gotti and his brothers grew up in poverty and turned to a life of crime at an early age . Gotti quickly became one of the crime family 's biggest earners and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Gambino family underboss Aniello Dellacroce , operating out of the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens . Early in his criminal career and following the FBI 's indictment of members of Gotti 's crew for selling narcotics , Gotti began to fear that he and his brother would be killed by Gambino boss Paul Castellano for selling drugs . As this fear continued to grow , and amidst growing dissent over the leadership of the crime family , Gotti organized the murder of Castellano in December 1985 and took over the family shortly thereafter , leaving Gotti as the boss of what has been described as America 's most powerful crime syndicate , and one that made hundreds of millions of dollars a year from racketeering , hijacking , loan sharking , drug trafficking , bookmaking , prostitution , extortion , pornography , illegal gambling and other criminal activities . At his peak , Gotti was one of the most powerful and dangerous crime bosses in the United States . During his era he became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style , which gained him favor with some of the general public . While his peers avoided attracting attention , especially from the media , Gotti became known as The Dapper Don , for his expensive clothes and personality in front of news cameras . He was later given the nickname The Teflon Don after three high-profile trials in the 1980s resulted in his acquittal , though it was later revealed that the trials had been tainted by jury tampering , juror misconduct , and witness intimidation . Law enforcement authorities continued gathering evidence against Gotti that helped lead to his downfall . According to Sammy Gravano , Gotti earned between $ 5-20 million per year during his tenure as Gambino boss .

The citizens of the republic were known as Texians . The region of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas commonly referred to as Mexican Texas declared its independence from Mexico during the Texas Revolution in 1835-1836 . The Texas war of independence ended on April 21 , 1836 , but Mexico refused to recognize the independence of the Republic of Texas , and intermittent conflicts between the two states continued into the 1840s . The United States recognized the Republic of Texas in March 1837 but declined to annex the territory . The Republic-claimed borders were based upon the Treaties of Velasco between the newly created Texas Republic and Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna of Mexico . The eastern boundary had been defined by the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty of 1819 between the United States and Spain , which recognised the Sabine River as the eastern boundary of Spanish Texas and western boundary of the Missouri Territory . Under the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty of 1819 the United States had renounced its claim to Spanish land to the east of the Rocky Mountains and to the north of the Rio Grande , which it claimed to have acquired as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . The republic 's southern and western boundary with Mexico was disputed throughout the republic 's existence . Texas claimed the Rio Grande as its southern boundary , while Mexico insisted that the Nueces River was the boundary . In practice , much of the disputed territory was occupied by the Comanche and outside the control of either state , but Texian claims included the eastern portions of New Mexico , which was administered by Mexico throughout this period .",

Al-Qaeda operates as a network of Islamic extremists and Salafist jihadists . The organization has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , the European Union , the United States , the United Kingdom , Russia , India , and various other countries ( see below ) . Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries , including the 1998 United States embassy bombings , the September 11 attacks , and the 2002 Bali bombings . The United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the War on Terror , which sought to undermine al-Qaeda and its allies . The deaths of key leaders , including that of Osama bin Laden , have led al-Qaeda 's operations to shift from the top down organization and planning of attacks , to the planning of attacks which are carried out by associated groups and lone-wolf operators . Al-Qaeda characteristically employs attacks which include suicide attacks and the simultaneous bombing of several targets . Activities which are ascribed to al-Qaeda involve the actions of those who have made a pledge of loyalty to bin Laden , or to the actions of al-Qaeda-linked individuals who have undergone training in one of its camps in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq or Sudan . Al-Qaeda ideologues envision the removal of all foreign influences in Muslim countries . Al-Qaeda members believe that a Christian-Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam . As Salafist jihadists , members of al-Qaeda believe that the killing of non-combatants is religiously sanctioned . This belief ignores the aspects of religious scripture which forbid the murder of non-combatants and internecine fighting .",

  "/wiki/White_supremacy": "White supremacy or white supremacism is the racist belief that white people are superior to people of other races and therefore should be dominant over them . White supremacy has roots in the now-discredited doctrine of scientific racism and often relies on pseudoscientific arguments . Like most similar movements such as neo-Nazism , white supremacists typically oppose members of other races as well as Jews . The term is also used to describe a political ideology that perpetuates and maintains the social , political , historical , or institutional domination by white people ( as evidenced by historical and contemporary sociopolitical structures such as the Atlantic slave trade , Jim Crow laws in the United States , the set of White Australia policies from the 1890s until the mid-1970s , and apartheid in South Africa ) . Different forms of white supremacism put forth different conceptions of who is considered white , and different groups of white supremacists identify various racial and cultural groups as their primary enemy . In academic usage , particularly in usage which draws on critical race theory or intersectionality , the term white supremacy can also refer to a political or socioeconomic system , in which white people enjoy a structural advantage ( privilege ) over other ethnic groups , on both a collective and individual level .",
  "/wiki/Racket_(crime)": "A racket , according to the current common and most general definition , is an organized criminal act in which the criminal act is some form of substantial business , or a way to earn illegal money either regularly , or briefly but repeatedly . A racket is therefore generally a repeated or continuous organized criminal operation . However , according to the more specific definition , racketeering constitutes extortion or criminal coercion . Originally and often still specifically , a racket referred to a criminal act in which the perpetrator or perpetrators fraudulently offer a service that will not be put into effect , a service to solve a nonexistent problem , or to solve a problem that would not exist without the racket . Conducting a racket is racketeering . Particularly , the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it , but that fact may be concealed , with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party . The most common example of a racket is the protection racket , which promises to protect the target business or person from dangerous individuals in the neighborhood and then either collects the money or causes damage to the business until the owner pays . The racket exists as both the problem and its solution , and it is used as a method of extortion . However , the term racket has expanded in definition and may now be used less strictly to refer to any continuous or repeated illegal organized crime operation , including those that do not necessarily involve fraudulent practices . For example , racket may be used to refer to the numbers racket or the drug racket , neither of which generally involve fraud or deception with regard to the intended clientele . Racketeering is most often associated with organized crime , and the term was coined by the Employers ' Association of Chicago in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the Teamsters union .",
  "/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)": "In criminal law , a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime at some time in the future . Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement , to constitute an offense . There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and , in most countries , no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect ( compare attempts which require proximity to the full offense ) . For the purposes of concurrence , the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or can not be traced . Finally , repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability ( unless , in some cases , it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts ) but may reduce their sentence . An unindicted co-conspirator , or unindicted conspirator , is a person or entity that is alleged in an indictment to have engaged in conspiracy , but who is not charged in the same indictment . Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity , pragmatic considerations , and evidentiary concerns .",

Since 2016 , the Taliban 's leader is Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada . From 1996 to 2001 , the Taliban held power over roughly three quarters of Afghanistan , and enforced there a strict interpretation of Sharia , or Islamic law . The Taliban emerged in 1994 as one of the prominent factions in the Afghan Civil War and largely consisted of students ( talib ) from the Pashtun areas of eastern and southern Afghanistan who had been educated in traditional Islamic schools , and fought during the Soviet-Afghan War . Under the leadership of Mohammed Omar , the movement spread throughout most of Afghanistan , sequestering power from the Mujahideen warlords . The totalitarian Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was established in 1996 and the Afghan capital was transferred to Kandahar . It held control of most of the country until being overthrown after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in December 2001 following the September 11 attacks . At its peak , formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban 's government was acknowledged by only three nations : Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates . The group later regrouped as an insurgency movement to fight the American-backed Karzai administration and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) in the War in Afghanistan . The Taliban have been condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law , which has resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans , especially women . During their rule from 1996 to 2001 , the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians , denied UN food supplies to 160,000 starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth , burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes .

The United Kingdom was a key ally of the United States , offering support for military action from the start of preparations for the invasion .

The US invasion of Afghanistan became the first phase of the War in Afghanistan ( 2001-present ) . US President George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda ; bin Laden had already been wanted by the FBI since 1998 . The Taliban declined to extradite him unless given what they deemed convincing evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks , and ignored demands to shut down terrorist bases and hand over other terrorist suspects apart from bin Laden . The request was dismissed by the US as a meaningless delaying tactic , and it launched Operation Enduring Freedom on October 7 , 2001 with the United Kingdom . The two were later joined by other forces , including the Northern Alliance troops on the ground . The US and its allies rapidly drove the Taliban from power by December 17 , 2001 , and built military bases near major cities across the country . Most al-Qaeda and Taliban members were not captured , escaping to neighboring Pakistan or retreating to rural or remote mountainous regions during the Battle of Tora Bora .",

  "/wiki/Continuing_Criminal_Enterprise_Statute": "The Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute ( commonly referred to as CCE Statute or The Kingpin Statute ) is a United States federal law that targets large-scale drug traffickers who are responsible for long-term and elaborate drug conspiracies . Unlike the RICO Act , which covers a wide range of organized crime enterprises , the CCE statute covers only major narcotics organizations . CCE is codified as Chapter 13 of Title 21 of the United States Code , 21 U.S.C . \u00a7 848 . The statute makes it a federal crime to commit or conspire to commit a continuing series of felony violations of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 when such acts are taken in concert with five or more other persons . For conviction under this statute , the offender must have been an organizer , manager , or supervisor of the continuing operation and have obtained substantial income or resources from the drug violations . The sentence for a first CCE conviction is a mandatory minimum twenty years ' imprisonment ( with a maximum of life imprisonment ) , a fine of not more than $ 2 million , and forfeiture of profits and any interest in the enterprise . Under the so-called super kingpin provision added as subsection ( b ) to the CCE statute in 1984 , a person convicted of being a principal administrator , organizer , or leader of a criminal enterprise that either involves a large amount of narcotics ( at least 300 times the quantity that would trigger a five-year mandatory-minimum sentence for possession ) , or generates a large amount of money ( at least $ 10 million in gross receipts during a single year ) , must serve a mandatory life sentence without possibility of parole ( sometimes referred to as a living death or pine box sentence , since the offender is strictly ineligible for release while alive ) . Anyone engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise who intentionally kills a person or causes an intentional killing may be sentenced to death . Probation , parole , and suspension of the sentence are prohibited .",
  "/wiki/Money_laundering": "Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions . The overall scheme of this process returns the money to the launderer in an obscure and indirect way . One problem of criminal activities is accounting for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies . Considerable time and effort may be put into strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion . Implementing such strategies is generally called money laundering . After money has been laundered , it can be used for legitimate purposes . Law enforcement agencies of many jurisdictions have set up sophisticated systems in an effort to detect suspicious transactions or activities , and many have set up international cooperative arrangements to assist each other in these endeavors . The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) estimates that The estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2-5% of global GDP , or $ 800 billion - $ 2 trillion in current US dollars . In a number of legal and regulatory systems , the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime , and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system ( involving things such as securities , digital currencies , credit cards , and traditional currency ) , including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions . Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering ( which is concerned with source of funds ) with terrorism financing ( which is concerned with destination of funds ) when regulating the financial system . Some countries treat obfuscation of sources of money as also constituting money laundering , whether it is intentional or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations . Other countries define money laundering in such a way as to include money from activity that would have been a crime in that country , even if the activity was legal where the actual conduct occurred .",

It has been the de facto governing authority of the Gaza Strip since its takeover of that area in 2007 . During this period it fought several wars with Israel . Israel , the United States and the European Union classify , either in whole or in part , Hamas as a terrorist organization . This classification is one among various and diverse international positions on the nature of Hamas . Russia , China , and Turkey are some countries who view Hamas in a positive light . Hamas was founded in 1987 , soon after the First Intifada broke out , as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood , which in its Gaza branch had been non-confrontational towards Israel , refrained from resistance , and was hostile to the PLO . Co-founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin stated in 1987 , and the Hamas Charter affirmed in 1988 , that Hamas was founded to liberate Palestine , including modern-day Israel , from Israeli occupation and to establish an Islamic state in the area that is now Israel , the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . The group has stated that it may accept a 10-year truce if Israel withdraws to the 1967 borders and allows Palestinian refugees from 1948 , including their descendants , to return to what is now Israel , although clarifying that this does not mean recognition of Israel or the end of the conflict . Hamas 's military wing objected to the truce offer . The military wing of Hamas has launched attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers , often describing them as retaliatory , in particular for assassinations of the upper echelon of their leadership .",

Kahane publicized his Kahanism ideology , which he claimed was simply Torah Judaism based on halakha ( Jewish law ) , through published works , weekly articles , speeches , debates on college campuses and in synagogues throughout the United States , and appearances on various televised programs and radio shows . He was an intense advocate for Jewish causes , such as organizing defense squads and patrols in Jewish neighborhoods and demanding for the Soviet Union to release its oppressed Jews .

Kahane proposed enforcing halakha as codified by Maimonides . Non-Jews wishing to dwell in Israel would have three options : remain as resident strangers with limited rights , leave Israel and receive compensation for their property , or be forcibly removed without compensation . While serving in the Knesset in the mid-1980s Kahane proposed numerous laws , none of which passed , to emphasize Judaism in public schools , reduce Israel 's bureaucracy , forbid sexual relations between non-Jews and Jews , and end cultural meetings between Jewish and Arab students .
