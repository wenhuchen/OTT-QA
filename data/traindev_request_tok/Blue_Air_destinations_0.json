The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

  "/wiki/Budapest": "Budapest ( /\u02c8bu\u02d0d\u0259p\u025bst/ , Hungarian pronunciation : [ \u02c8bud\u0252p\u025b\u0283t ] ) is the capital and the most populous city of Hungary , and the ninth-largest city in the European Union by population within city limits . The city has an estimated population of 1,752,286 over a land area of about 525 square kilometres ( 203 square miles ) . Budapest is both a city and county , and forms the centre of the Budapest metropolitan area , which has an area of 7,626 square kilometres ( 2,944 square miles ) and a population of 3,303,786 , comprising 33% of the population of Hungary . The history of Budapest began when an early Celtic settlement transformed into the Roman town of Aquincum , the capital of Lower Pannonia . The Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late 9th century , but the area was pillaged by the Mongols in 1241-42 . Re-established Buda became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist culture by the 15th century . The Battle of Moh\u00e1cs , in 1526 , was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule . After the reconquest of Buda in 1686 , the region entered a new age of prosperity , with Pest-Buda becoming a global city after the unification of Buda , \u00d3buda , and Pest on 17 November 1873 , with the name 'Budapest ' given to the new capital . Budapest also became the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a great power that dissolved in 1918 , following World War I . The city was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 , the Battle of Budapest in 1945 , and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 . Budapest is an Alpha \u2212 global city with strengths in commerce , finance , media , art , fashion , research , technology , education , and entertainment . It is Hungary 's financial centre and was ranked as the second fastest-developing urban economy in Europe .",
  "/wiki/Hungary": "Hungary ( Hungarian : Magyarorsz\u00e1g [ \u02c8m\u0252\u025f\u0252rorsa\u02d0\u0261 ] ( listen ) ) is a country in Central Europe . Spanning 93,030 square kilometres ( 35,920 sq mi ) in the Carpathian Basin , it borders Slovakia to the north , Ukraine to the northeast , Romania to the east and southeast , Serbia to the south , Croatia and Slovenia to the southwest , and Austria to the west . With about 10 million inhabitants , Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union . The official language is Hungarian , which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world , and among the few non-Indo-European languages to be widely spoken in Europe . Hungary 's capital and largest city is Budapest ; other major urban areas include Debrecen , Szeged , Miskolc , P\u00e9cs and Gy\u0151r . The territory of modern Hungary was for centuries inhabited by a succession of peoples , including Celts , Romans , Germanic tribes , Huns , West Slavs and the Avars . The foundations of the Hungarian state were established in the late ninth century CE by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000 , converting his realm to a Christian kingdom . By the 12th century , Hungary became a regional power , reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) . It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power . The Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I , and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary 's current borders , resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory , 58% of its population , and 32% of ethnic Hungarians .",

The airport is located 16 kilometres ( 9.9 mi ) southeast of the center of Budapest ( bordering Pest county ) and was renamed in 2011 in honour of the most famous Hungarian composer Franz Liszt ( Liszt Ferenc , in Hungarian ) on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of his birth . It offers international connections primarily within Europe , but also to Africa , to the Middle East , to North America and to the Far East . In 2019 , the airport handled 16.2 million passengers . The airport is the headquarters and primary hub for Wizz Air and base for Ryanair . In 2012 it experienced a significant drop in aircraft movements and handled cargo , primarily due to the collapse of Mal\u00e9v Hungarian Airlines earlier in the year , hence losing a large portion of connecting passengers . It had been the hub for Mal\u00e9v until the airline 's bankruptcy on 3 February 2012 . In 2015 North-American and Middle-Eastern carriers announced direct flights to Budapest . Together with the continuously expanding network of low-cost carriers , the airport was not only able to survive but to grow in a way that was unprecedented in the region . In 2018 LOT Polish Airlines made Budapest their first hub outside Poland , with flights to New York-JFK , Chicago-O'Hare , Krak\u00f3w and London City Airport . Nowadays , the Budapest hub of Wizz Air is the largest of all with more than 60 destinations .",
