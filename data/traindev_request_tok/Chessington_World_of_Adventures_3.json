  "/wiki/Carousel": "A carousel ( American English : from French carrousel and Italian carosello ) , roundabout ( British English ) , or merry-go-round , is a type of amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders . The seats are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts , many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping , to the accompaniment of looped circus music . [ citation needed ] This leads to one of the alternative American names , the galloper ( however see direction of rotation below ) . Other popular names are jumper , horseabout , and flying horses . [ citation needed ] Carousels are commonly populated with horses , each horse weighing roughly 100 lbs ( 45 kg ) , but may include a variety of mounts , for example pigs , zebras , tigers , or mythological creatures such as dragons or unicorns . Sometimes , chair-like or bench-like seats are used , and occasionally mounts can be shaped like aeroplanes or cars . The roundabouts or merry-go-rounds installed in playgrounds are usually somewhat different devices : simple , child-powered rotating platforms with bars or handles to which children can cling while riding .",

  "/wiki/Drop_Tower": "A drop tower or big drop is a type of amusement ride incorporating a central structure or tower . Drop towers vary in height , passenger capacity , lift type , and brake type . Many are custom-made , although there are some mass-produced designs . Riders experience free-fall initially , followed by rapid heavy deceleration . With most drop towers , a gondola carrying riders is lifted to the top of a large vertical structure , then released to free-fall down the tower . Brakes activate to slow the gondola as it approaches the bottom of the ride . Some designs expand on this concept with features such as rotating gondolas , or several bounces before coming to rest . Most drop towers require child riders to exceed a minimum height ; limits vary widely depending upon the nature of the tower , with a 30-foot ( 9 m ) tower for smaller children from 37 inches ( 95 cm ) tall , and a 115-foot ( 35 m ) tower having a 51-inch ( 130 cm ) restriction . Drop towers use a magnetic braking system to slow the carriage quickly and smoothly once it reaches the bottom of the tower . This system is fail-safe because magnets do not need to be powered by electricity or other sources ; they work intrinsically by the laws of magnetism .",

  "/wiki/Dennis_the_Menace_and_Gnasher": "Dennis and Gnasher ( previously titled Dennis the Menace and Gnasher , and originally titled Dennis the Menace ) is a long-running comic strip in the British children 's comic The Beano , published by DC Thomson , of Dundee , Scotland . The comic stars a boy named Dennis the Menace and his Abyssinian wire-haired tripe hound Gnasher . The strip first appeared in issue 452 , dated 17 March 1951 ( on sale 12 March 1951 ) , and is the longest-running strip in the comic . The idea and name of the character emerged when the comic 's editor heard a British music hall song with the chorus I 'm Dennis the Menace from Venice . The creation of Dennis in the 1950s saw sales of The Beano soar . From issue 1678 onwards ( dated 14 September 1974 ) Dennis the Menace replaced Biffo the Bear on the front cover , and has been there ever since . Coincidentally , on 12 March 1951 , another comic strip named Dennis the Menace debuted in the US . As a result of this , the US series has initially been retitled Dennis for UK audiences , while the British character 's appearances are often titled Dennis and Gnasher outside the UK . Dennis is the archetypal badly behaved schoolboy . The main recurring storyline throughout the years features his campaign of terror against a gang of 'softies ' ( effeminate , well-behaved boys ) , particularly Walter . Walter finds himself in unfavourable circumstances on many occasions , although he sometimes gets the last laugh . Author Michael Rosen states , In most children 's books a bad child gets made good - but the great thing about Dennis is he never gets better .",
  "/wiki/Wind_in_the_Willows": "The Wind in the Willows is a children 's novel by Scottish novelist Kenneth Grahame , first published in 1908 . Alternatingly slow-moving and fast-paced , it focuses on four anthropomorphised animals : Mole , Rat ( a European water vole ) , Toad , and Badger . They live in a pastoral version of Edwardian England . The novel is notable for its mixture of mysticism , adventure , morality , and camaraderie , and celebrated for its evocation of the nature of the Thames Valley . In 1908 , Grahame retired from his position as secretary of the Bank of England . He moved back to Berkshire , where he had lived as a child , and spent his time by the River Thames , doing much as the animal characters in his book do - to quote , simply messing about in boats - and expanding the bedtime stories he had earlier told his son Alastair into a manuscript for the book . The novel was in its 31st printing when playwright A . A. Milne adapted part of it for the stage as Toad of Toad Hall in 1929 . In 1949 , the first film adaptation was produced by Walt Disney as one of two segments in the package film The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad . In 2003 , The Wind in the Willows was listed at # 16 in the BBC 's survey The Big Read . More than a century after its original publication , it was adapted again for the stage , as a 2016 musical by Julian Fellowes ."
