  "/wiki/The_Beatles": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960 . With a line-up comprising John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they are regarded as the most influential band of all time . The group were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music 's recognition as an art form . Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways ; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock . As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 . As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed Beatlemania , the band acquired the nickname the Fab Four , with Epstein , Martin and other members of the band 's entourage sometimes given the informal title of fifth Beatle . By early 1964 , the Beatles were international stars , leading the British Invasion of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records . They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day 's Night ( 1964 ) . From 1965 onwards , they produced increasingly innovative recordings , including the albums Rubber Soul ( 1965 ) , Revolver ( 1966 ) and Sgt .",
