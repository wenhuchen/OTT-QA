  "/wiki/Argentina": "Argentina ( Spanish : [ a\u027exen\u02c8tina ] ) , officially the Argentine Republic [ A ] ( Spanish : Rep\u00fablica Argentina ) , is a country located mostly in the southern half of South America . Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

Chile also claims about 1,250,000 square kilometres ( 480,000 sq mi ) of Antarctica under the Chilean Antarctic Territory . [ nb 3 ] , The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper and lithium . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands . Spain conquered and colonized the region in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in the north and centre , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited what is now south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879-83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s , the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil .",

The Drivers ' Championship was won by Keke Rosberg and the Constructors ' Championship by Ferrari . Motorsport journalist Nigel Roebuck later wrote that the 1982 season was an ugly year , pock-marked by tragedy , by dissension , by greed , and yet , paradoxically , it produced some of the most memorable racing ever seen . It started with a drivers ' strike at the season opener in South Africa and saw a partial race boycott as part of the ongoing FISA-FOCA war at the San Marino Grand Prix . Two drivers lost their lives during the season : Gilles Villeneuve during qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix and Riccardo Paletti at the start of the Canadian Grand Prix . Later , championship favourite Didier Pironi suffered a career-ending accident while qualifying for the German Grand Prix . These incidents and several other major accidents led to regulation changes to increase driver security for 1983 . Rosberg won only one race all season - the Swiss Grand Prix - but consistency gave him the Drivers ' Championship , five points clear of Pironi and John Watson . Rosberg was the second driver to win the championship having won only one race in the season , after Mike Hawthorn in 1958 . Eleven different drivers from seven different teams won a race during the season , with no driver winning more than twice ; there was also a run of nine different winners in nine consecutive races from the Monaco Grand Prix to the Swiss Grand Prix . Ferrari , who replaced Villeneuve with Patrick Tambay and Pironi with 1978 World Champion Mario Andretti , managed to score enough points to secure the Constructors ' Championship , finishing five clear of McLaren with Renault third .",

Finland 's Mika H\u00e4kkinen won his first Drivers ' Championship , and McLaren-Mercedes won the Constructors ' Championship , the first for the McLaren team since 1991 .

H\u00e4kkinen won four of the first six races to establish a clear lead in the Drivers ' Championship , but a strong mid-season resurgence from Michael Schumacher and Ferrari , including five wins , put the German driver level on points with H\u00e4kkinen with two races remaining . H\u00e4kkinen then won the Luxembourg Grand Prix from Schumacher to take a four-point lead into the season finale in Japan . There , Schumacher took pole position only to stall on the grid and then suffer a puncture , leaving H\u00e4kkinen to win the race and the championship . H\u00e4kkinen 's teammate David Coulthard finished third overall with Schumacher 's teammate Eddie Irvine fourth , while McLaren 's final margin over Ferrari in the Constructors ' Championship was 23 points . With the factory withdrawal of Renault and the departure of designer Adrian Newey to McLaren , the Williams team and Jacques Villeneuve were unable to defend their respective championships . Williams ultimately suffered their first winless season since 1988 , though they still finished third in the Constructors ' Championship . The Benetton team also failed to win a race in 1998 , despite young Italian Giancarlo Fisichella showing promise . Jordan , led by former champion Damon Hill , failed to score a point in the first half of the season , but a strong resurgence in the second half - including Hill taking the team 's first F1 victory in wet conditions in Belgium with teammate Ralf Schumacher second - enabled them to finish fourth in the Constructors ' Championship .",

He finished in the points on his Formula One d\u00e9but - at the San Martin Autodrome in Buenos Aires , Argentina , where he took his first podium a year later - and took his first race victory a year later at his home Grand Prix in France , driving for the factory Renault team .

The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino .

With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",
