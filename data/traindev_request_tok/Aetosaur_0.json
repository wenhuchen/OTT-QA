Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States .

In Europe the epoch was called the Keuper , after a German lithostratigraphic group ( a sequence of rock strata ) that has a roughly corresponding age . The Late Triassic spans the time between 237 Ma and 201.3 Ma ( million years ago ) . It is preceeded by the Middle Triassic epoch and is followed by the Early Jurassic epoch . The Late Triassic is divided into the Carnian , Norian and Rhaetian ages . Many of the first dinosaurs evolved during the Late Triassic , including Plateosaurus , Coelophysis , and Eoraptor . The extinction event that began during the Late Triassic resulted in the disappearance of about 76% of all terrestrial and marine life species , as well as almost 20% of taxonomic families . Although the Late Triassic Epoch did not prove to be as destructive as the preceding Permian Period , which took place approximately 50 million years earlier and destroyed about 70% of land species , 57% of insect families as well as 95% of marine life , it resulted in great decreased in population sizes of many living organism populations .

G. pekinensis was named and described by Heckert et al . ( 2015 ) on the basis of ten rows of bony plates called osteoderms , representing the front part of an armored carapace that would have covered the back of the animal . These plates were found embedded in sandstone and conglomerate boulders near a brick quarry in Chatham County , North Carolina , which likely originated from the Late Triassic Pekin Formation . ( The Pekin Formation consists of interbedded red mudstones , siltstones , sandstones and conglomerates ; it was the fine-grained mudstones and siltstones that the mining operation was targeting for brick-making , so coarser-grained blocks were removed from the pit ) . Gorgetosuchus was part of a diverse faunal community in a continental rift valley system during the Late Triassic , which also included traversodontids , phytosaurs , dicynodonts , and temnospondyls . Gorgetosuchus coexisted with two other aetosaurs , Lucasuchus and Coahomasuchus . Gorgetosuchus is unique among aetosaurs in having cervical ( neck ) osteoderms that nearly wrap around the entire neck and are strongly angled to give the neck a hexagonal shape in cross-section . The lateral ( side ) and paramedian ( upper ) osteoderms each bear prominent spines . Other aetosaurs such as Longosuchus also have neck spines , but only on the lateral osteoderms . The cervical osteoderms are wider than they are long , a feature that unites Gorgetosuchus with the most basal ( primitive ) aetosaurs .

Lucasuchus was first proposed to be a junior subjective synonym of Longosuchus in 1999 , and several other studies have also considered it to be an invalid genus . However , more recent studies concluded that Lucasuchus is not congeneric with any other known aetosaur genus , and is likely to be more closely related to Desmatosuchus and Acaenasuchus than to Longosuchus . The presence of elongate lateral osteoderm horns is shared by all of these genera , which make up the subfamily Desmatosuchinae . It has been suggested that Lucasuchus is either a sexual dimorph belonging to the same species as Longosuchus meadei or an ontogenetic stage of the species ( meaning that it represents one particular age group ) . However , several characteristics of Lucasuchus may indicate that it is indeed distinct from L. meadei rather than an example of morphological variation . For example , Lucasuchus has a clear radial pattern of pits and grooves on the paramedian osteoderms of the back while Longosuchus has only a random pattern of pits on the paramedians . In Lucasuchus , the paramedians have large conical eminences , or projections , while in Longosuchus these projections are only present in the form of low pyramidal bosses .

The formation consist of reddish siltstone and mudstone with lenses of sandstone and conglomerate . Thickness of the formation in the type area is 161.5 meters . It increases to the south , and in some places exceeds 200 m. The formation contains diverse fossils , including vertebrate remains .",
  "/wiki/Neoaetosauroides": "Neoaetosauroides is an extinct genus of primitive aetosaur . Its type and only species is N. engaeus . Fossils have been found in Los Colorados Formation outcropping along the Sierra Morada River in the Ischigualasto-Villa Uni\u00f3n Basin in La Rioja , Argentina , and date back to the Norian age of the Late Triassic . It was the first aetosaur known from the formation , with remains being discovered in the 1960s .",
  "/wiki/Los_Colorados_Formation": "The Los Colorados Formation is a sedimentary rock formation of the Ischigualasto-Villa Uni\u00f3n Basin , found in the provinces of San Juan and La Rioja in Argentina . The formation dates back to the Norian age of the Late Triassic . The up to 600 metres ( 2,000 ft ) thick formation comprises sandstones , siltstones , mudstones and conglomerates with gypsum layers deposited in a fluvial to lacustrine environment . The formation is the uppermost stratigraphic unit of the Agua de la Pe\u00f1a Group , overlying the Lagerst\u00e4tte of the Ischigualasto Formation . Los Colorados Formation is partly covered by the Cretaceous Cerro Rajado Formation , separated by an unconformity . The formation is known for its fossils of early dinosaurs , including the coelophysoid Zupaysaurus and the prosauropods Coloradisaurus , Lessemsaurus , and Riojasaurus . Magnetostratigraphic analysis suggests that the Los Colorados Formation was deposited between 227 and 213 million years ago .",
  "/wiki/Paratypothorax": "Paratypothorax is an extinct genus of aetosaur , known by one species , Paratypothorax andressi . It was first named in 1985 from specimens collected from the Lower Stubensandstein in Germany and was also noted to be present in the Chinle Group of the southwestern United States in both the Dockum and Chinle Formations , which are latest Carnian and Rhaetian in age , respectively . The genus was described from osteoderms that were initially referred to the phytosaur Belodon kappfi . Material from Paratypothorax has also been reported from the Norian-age Fleming Fjord Formation in Greenland .",

  "/wiki/Redondasuchus": "Redondasuchus is an extinct genus of aetosaur . It may a junior synonym of Typothorax coccinarum , another aetosaur . Redondasuchus is a member of the clade Typothoracisinae within the subfamily Aetosaurinae , and lived during the middle Norian stage of the Late Triassic . Material belonging to the genus has been found from the Redonda Formation in east-central New Mexico . The type species , R. reseri , was named in 1991 after having been referred to as a species of Typothorax since 1985 . A second species , R. rineharti , was described in 2006 .",
