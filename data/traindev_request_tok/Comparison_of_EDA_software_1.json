  "/wiki/Routing_(EDA)": "In electronic design , wire routing , commonly called simply routing , is a step in the design of printed circuit boards ( PCBs ) and integrated circuits ( ICs ) . It builds on a preceding step , called placement , which determines the location of each active element of an IC or component on a PCB . After placement , the routing step adds wires needed to properly connect the placed components while obeying all design rules for the IC . Together , the placement and routing steps of IC design are known as place and route . The task of all routers is the same . They are given some pre-existing polygons consisting of pins ( also called terminals ) on cells , and optionally some pre-existing wiring called preroutes . Each of these polygons are associated with a net , usually by name or number . The primary task of the router is to create geometries such that all terminals assigned to the same net are connected , no terminals assigned to different nets are connected , and all design rules are obeyed . A router can fail by not connecting terminals that should be connected ( an open ) , by mistakenly connecting two terminals that should not be connected ( a short ) , or by creating a design rule violation . In addition , to correctly connect the nets , routers may also be expected to make sure the design meets timing , has no crosstalk problems , meets any metal density requirements , does not suffer from antenna effects , and so on . This long list of often conflicting objectives is what makes routing extremely difficult . Almost every problem associated with routing is known to be intractable .",

  "/wiki/FreeBSD": "FreeBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , which was based on Research Unix . The first version of FreeBSD was released in 1993 . In 2005 , FreeBSD was the most popular open-source BSD operating system , accounting for more than three-quarters of all installed BSD systems . FreeBSD has similarities with Linux , with two major differences in scope and licensing : FreeBSD maintains a complete system , i.e . the project delivers a kernel , device drivers , userland utilities , and documentation , as opposed to Linux only delivering a kernel and drivers , and relying on third-parties for system software ; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a permissive BSD license , as opposed to the copyleft GPL used by Linux . The FreeBSD project includes a security team overseeing all software shipped in the base distribution . A wide range of additional third-party applications may be installed using the pkg package management system or FreeBSD Ports , or by compiling source code . Due to its licensing , much of FreeBSD 's codebase has become an integral part of other operating systems , such as Apple 's Darwin ( the basis for macOS , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS ) , FreeNAS ( an open-source NAS/SAN operating system ) , and the system software for Sony 's PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 .",
  "/wiki/Java_(programming_language)": "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based , object-oriented , and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible . It is intended to let application developers write once , run anywhere ( WORA ) , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation . Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in September 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 and 12 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version ( currently Java 13 ) or an LTS release .",
  "/wiki/Very-large-scale_integration": "Very large-scale integration ( VLSI ) is the process of creating an integrated circuit ( IC ) by combining millions of MOS transistors onto a single chip . VLSI began in the 1970s when MOS integrated circuit chips were widely adopted , enabling complex semiconductor and telecommunication technologies to be developed . The microprocessor and memory chips are VLSI devices . Before the introduction of VLSI technology , most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform . An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU , ROM , RAM and other glue logic . VLSI lets IC designers add all of these into one chip .",
  "/wiki/Printed_circuit_board": "A printed circuit board ( PCB ) mechanically supports and electrically connects electrical or electronic components using conductive tracks , pads and other features etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate . Components are generally soldered onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it . Printed circuit boards are used in all but the simplest electronic products . They are also used in some electrical products , such as passive switch boxes . Alternatives to PCBs include wire wrap and point-to-point construction , both once popular but now rarely used . PCBs require additional design effort to lay out the circuit , but manufacturing and assembly can be automated . Specialized CAD software is available to do much of the work of layout . Mass-producing circuits with PCBs is cheaper and faster than with other wiring methods , as components are mounted and wired in one operation . Large numbers of PCBs can be fabricated at the same time , and the layout only has to be done once . PCBs can also be made manually in small quantities , with reduced benefits . PCBs can be single-sided ( one copper layer ) , double-sided ( two copper layers on both sides of one substrate layer ) , or multi-layer ( outer and inner layers of copper , alternating with layers of substrate ) . Multi-layer PCBs allow for much higher component density , because circuit traces on the inner layers would otherwise take up surface space between components .",

  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/Metric_system": "Metric system refers to the internationally recognised decimalised system of measurement known as the International System of Units ( SI ) , or to one of its predecessors . It is in widespread use , and where it is adopted , it is the only or most common system of weights and measures . It is used to measure everyday things such as the mass of a sack of flour , the height of a person , the speed of a car , and the volume of fuel in its tank . It is also used in science , industry and trade . The first nation to adopt the metric system ( a process called metrication ) was France , in the 1790s . In subsequent decades and centuries , most other nations adopted it in part or in full , with notable holdouts being Liberia , Myanmar , and the United States ( which primarily uses U.S. customary units ) . In its modern form , it consists of a set of seven base units : metre for length , kilogram for mass , second for time , ampere for electrical current , kelvin for temperature , candela for luminous intensity and mole for quantity . These , together with their derived units , can measure any physical quantity . The metric system was designed to have properties that make it easy to use and widely applicable , including units based on the natural world , decimal ratios , prefixes for multiples and sub-multiples , and a structure of base and derived units . It is also a coherent system , which means that its units do not introduce conversion factors not already present in equations relating quantities . It has a property called rationalisation that eliminates certain constants of proportionality in equations of physics . The units of the metric system , originally taken from observable features of nature , are now defined by in terms of seven physical constants which have been given exact mathematical quantities .",
  "/wiki/US_customary_units": "United States customary units are a system of measurements commonly used in the United States . The United States customary system ( USCS or USC ) developed from English units which were in use in the British Empire before the U.S. became an independent country . However , the United Kingdom 's system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the imperial system , changing the definitions of some units . Therefore , while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their imperial counterparts , there are significant differences between the systems . The majority of U.S. customary units were redefined in terms of the meter and kilogram with the Mendenhall Order of 1893 and , in practice , for many years before . These definitions were refined by the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 . Americans primarily use customary units in commercial activities , as well as for personal and social use . In science , medicine , many sectors of industry , and some of government and military , metric units are used . The International System of Units ( SI ) , the modern form of the metric system , is preferred for many uses by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) . For newer units of measure where there is no traditional customary unit , international units are used , sometimes mixed with customary units , such as electrical resistance of wire expressed in ohms ( SI ) per thousand feet .",
  "/wiki/Gerber_format": "The Gerber format is an open ASCII vector format for printed circuit board ( PCB ) designs . It is the de facto standard used by PCB industry software to describe the printed circuit board images : copper layers , solder mask , legend , drill data , etc . The official website contains the specification , test files , notes and the Reference Gerber Viewer to support users and especially developers of Gerber software . Gerber is used in PCB fabrication data . PCBs are designed on a specialized electronic design automation ( EDA ) or a computer-aided design ( CAD ) system . The CAD systems output PCB fabrication data to allow fabrication of the board . This data typically contains a Gerber file for each image layer ( copper layers , solder mask , legend or silk. ) . Gerber is also the standard image input format for all bare board fabrication equipment needing image data , such as photoplotters , legend printers , direct imagers or automated optical inspection ( AOI ) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments . For assembly the fabrication data contains the solder paste layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components .

Pure digital simulations are also supported using VHDL and/or Verilog . Qucs supports a growing list of analog and digital components as well as SPICE sub-circuits . It is intended to be much simpler to use and handle than other circuit simulators like gEDA or PSPICE .",
  "/wiki/Schematic_capture": "Schematic capture or schematic entry is a step in the design cycle of electronic design automation ( EDA ) at which the electronic diagram , or electronic schematic of the designed electronic circuit is created by a designer . This is done interactively with the help of a schematic capture tool also known as schematic editor . The circuit design is the very first step of actual design of an electronic circuit . Typically sketches are drawn on paper , and then entered into a computer using a schematic editor . Therefore schematic entry is said to be a front-end operation of several others in the design flow . Despite the complexity of modern components - huge ball grid arrays and tiny passive components - schematic capture is easier today than it has been for many years . CAD software is easier to use and is available in full-featured expensive packages , very capable mid-range packages that sometimes have free versions and completely free versions that are either open source or directly linked to a printed circuit board fabrication company . In past years , schematic diagrams with mostly discrete components were fairly readable . However , with the newer high pin-count parts and with the almost universal use of standard letter or A4 sized paper , schematics have become less so . Many times , there will be a single large part on a page with nothing but pin reference keys to connect it to other pages . Readability levels can be enhanced by using buses and superbuses , related pins can be connected into a common bus and routed to other pages . Buses do n't need to be just the traditional address or data bus directly linked pins .",

  "/wiki/Design_rule_checking": "In electronics engineering , a design rule is a geometric constraint imposed on circuit board , semiconductor device , and integrated circuit ( IC ) designers to ensure their designs function properly , reliably , and can be produced with acceptable yield . Design rules for production are developed by process engineers based on the capability of their processes to realize design intent . Electronic design automation is used extensively to ensure that designers do not violate design rules ; a process called design rule checking ( DRC ) . DRC is a major step during physical verification signoff on the design , which also involves LVS ( layout versus schematic ) checks , XOR checks , ERC ( electrical rule check ) , and antenna checks . The importance of design rules and DRC is greatest for ICs , which have micro- or nano-scale geometries ; for advanced processes , some fabs also insist upon the use of more restricted rules to improve yield .",
  "/wiki/Verilator": "Verilator is a free and open-source software tool which converts Verilog ( a hardware description language ) to a cycle-accurate behavioral model in C++ or SystemC . It is restricted to modeling the synthesizable subset of Verilog and the generated models are cycle-accurate , 2-state , with synthesis ( zero delay ) semantics . As a consequence , the models typically offer higher performance than the more widely used event-driven simulators , which can process the entire Verilog language and model behavior within the clock cycle . Verilator is now used within academic research , open source projects and for commercial semiconductor development . It is part of the growing body of free EDA software .",
  "/wiki/SystemC": "SystemC is a set of C++ classes and macros which provide an event-driven simulation interface ( see also discrete event simulation ) . These facilities enable a designer to simulate concurrent processes , each described using plain C++ syntax . SystemC processes can communicate in a simulated real-time environment , using signals of all the datatypes offered by C++ , some additional ones offered by the SystemC library , as well as user defined . In certain respects , SystemC deliberately mimics the hardware description languages VHDL and Verilog , but is more aptly described as a system-level modeling language . SystemC is applied to system-level modeling , architectural exploration , performance modeling , software development , functional verification , and high-level synthesis . SystemC is often associated with electronic system-level ( ESL ) design , and with transaction-level modeling ( TLM ) .",
  "/wiki/ModelSim": "ModelSim is a multi-language HDL simulation environment by Mentor Graphics , for simulation of hardware description languages such as VHDL , Verilog and SystemC , and includes a built-in C debugger . ModelSim can be used independently , or in conjunction with Intel Quartus Prime , Xilinx ISE or Xilinx Vivado . Simulation is performed using the graphical user interface ( GUI ) , or automatically using scripts .",
  "/wiki/XCircuit": "XCircuit is a Unix/X11 and Windows program for drawing publication-quality electrical circuit schematic diagrams and related figures and the production of circuit netlists through schematic capture . XCircuit regards circuits as inherently hierarchical and writes both PostScript output and hierarchical SPICE netlists . Circuit components are saved in and retrieved from libraries which are fully editable . XCircuit does not separate artistic expression from circuit drawing ; it maintains flexibility in style without compromising the power of schematic capture .",
  "/wiki/Unix": "Unix ( /\u02c8ju\u02d0n\u026aks/ ; trademarked as UNIX ) is a family of multitasking , multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT & T Unix , development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , and others . Initially intended for use inside the Bell System , AT & T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s , leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California , Berkeley ( BSD ) , Microsoft ( Xenix ) , IBM ( AIX ) , and Sun Microsystems ( Solaris ) . In the early 1990s , AT & T sold its rights in Unix to Novell , which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) in 1995 . The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group , a neutral industry consortium , which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification ( SUS ) . Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy : the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited , well-defined function , with a unified filesystem ( the Unix filesystem ) as the main means of communication , and a shell scripting and command language ( the Unix shell ) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows . Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system : almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language , thus allowing Unix to reach numerous platforms ."
