Settled in 1788 , the city is located at the northern side of the confluence of the Licking and Ohio rivers , the latter of which marks the state line with Kentucky . The city is the economic and cultural hub of the Cincinnati metropolitan area , the fastest growing economic power in the Midwestern United States based on increase of economic output , which had a population of 2,190,209 as of the 2018 census estimates . This makes it Ohio 's largest metropolitan area and the nation 's 29th-largest . With a city population estimated at 302,605 , Cincinnati is the third-largest city in Ohio and 65th in the United States . Cincinnati is also within a day 's drive of 49.70% of the United States populace , the most of any city in the United States . In the 19th century , Cincinnati was an American boomtown in the middle of the country . Throughout much of the 19th century , it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population , surpassed only by New Orleans and the older , established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard , as well as being the sixth-biggest city for a period spanning 1840 until 1860 . Cincinnati was the first city founded after the American Revolution , as well as the first major inland city in the country . Cincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period . However , it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants , who founded many of the city 's cultural institutions . By the end of the 19th century , with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping , trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati 's growth slowed considerably .",
  "/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Greggery_Peccary": "The Adventures of Greggery Peccary is a piece by Frank Zappa , originally released on the album Studio Tan in 1978 and later recompiled into the posthumously released L\u00e4ther album . An instrumental version now appears on the Wazoo CD featuring the original Wazoo ensemble and debuted at the Hollywood Bowl on September 10 , 1972 . On that CD it is in 4 movements totalling 33.05 minutes . The song is an epic that extended 20 minutes and 33 seconds in length when first released and later 21 minutes ( in a slightly different mix and edit ) on L\u00e4ther , mocking the rock opera style and reprising the extended story format used in Billy the Mountain and , to some extent , the lengthy adventures outlined in the Do n't Eat the Yellow Snow Suite . The piece required a large number of personnel to record , and received its basic tracking during The Grand Wazoo and Waka/Jawaka sessions in mid-1972 . The piece remained unfinished at the time of release of those two LPs ( later that year ) . Zappa would return to the recording on and off until its completion during the recording sessions for One Size Fits All in 1974 . The long interludes of avant-garde classical arrangement that are prevalent in the track made for a much more sophisticated sound than Billy the Mountain . Nonetheless , Zappa 's use of absurdist humor and political commentary remains prevalent in this piece .",
  "/wiki/Frank_Zappa": "Frank Vincent Zappa [ nb 1 ] ( December 21 , 1940 - December 4 , 1993 ) was an American multi-instrumentalist musician , composer , and bandleader . His work is characterized by nonconformity , free-form improvisation , sound experiments , musical virtuosity , and satire of American culture . In a career spanning more than 30 years , Zappa composed rock , pop , jazz , jazz fusion , orchestral and musique concr\u00e8te works , and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist . Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos , and designed album covers . He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era . As a self-taught composer and performer , Zappa 's diverse musical influences led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize . While in his teens , he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical modernism , African-American rhythm and blues , and doo-wop music . He began writing classical music in high school , while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands , later switching to electric guitar . His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention , Freak Out ! , combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages . He continued this eclectic and experimental approach , irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock , jazz or classical . Zappa 's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed Project/Object , with numerous musical phrases , ideas , and characters reappearing across his albums . His lyrics reflected his iconoclastic views of established social and political processes , structures and movements , often humorously so , and he has been described as the godfather of comedy rock .",

  "/wiki/Piggies": "Piggies is a song by the English rock group the Beatles from their 1968 album The Beatles ( also known as the White Album ) . Written by George Harrison as a social commentary , the song serves as an Orwellian satire on greed and consumerism . Among several elements it incorporates from classical music , the track features harpsichord and orchestral strings in the baroque pop style , which are contrasted by Harrison 's acerbic lyrics and the sound of grunting pigs . Although credited to George Martin , the recording was largely produced by Chris Thomas , who also contributed the harpsichord part . In the context of the turbulent political climate of 1968 , Piggies was adopted by the counterculture as an anti-establishment theme song . It was also among the tracks on The Beatles that cult leader Charles Manson used as the foundation for his Helter Skelter theory of an American race-related countercultural revolution . Inspired especially by the line What they need 's a damn good whacking , Manson 's followers left clues relating to the lyrics at the scenes of the Tate-LaBianca murders in August 1969 . Piggies has received widely varying responses from music critics , and its reputation suffered due to the association with Manson following the latter 's trial in 1971 . While some reviewers admire its musical qualities and recognise sardonic humour in the lyrics , others consider the song to be mean-spirited and lacking in subtlety . Harrison 's demo of the song , recorded at his home in Surrey , was included on the Beatles ' 1996 compilation Anthology 3 . A live version by Harrison , reinstating a verse that was omitted from the studio recording , appears on his 1992 album Live in Japan . Folk singer and activist Theo Bikel and anarcho-punk musician Danbert Nobacon are among the artists who have covered Piggies .",
  "/wiki/The_Beatles": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960 . With a line-up comprising John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they are regarded as the most influential band of all time . The group were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music 's recognition as an art form . Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways ; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock . As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 . As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed Beatlemania , the band acquired the nickname the Fab Four , with Epstein , Martin and other members of the band 's entourage sometimes given the informal title of fifth Beatle . By early 1964 , the Beatles were international stars , leading the British Invasion of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records .

Sometimes called the quiet Beatle , Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles ' work . Although the majority of the band 's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney , most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions . His songs for the group included Taxman , Within You Without You , While My Guitar Gently Weeps , Here Comes the Sun and Something . Harrison 's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt ; Carl Perkins , Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences . By 1965 , he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds , and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on Norwegian Wood ( This Bird Has Flown ) . Having initiated the band 's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967 , he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement . After the band 's break-up in 1970 , Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass , a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single , My Sweet Lord , and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist , the slide guitar . He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar , a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid .

  "/wiki/Human_nature": "Human nature is a bundle of characteristics , including ways of thinking , feeling , and acting , which humans are said to have naturally . The term is often regarded as capturing what it is to be human , or the essence of humanity . The term is controversial because it is disputed whether or not such an essence exists . Arguments about human nature have been a mainstay of philosophy for centuries and the concept continues to provoke lively philosophical debate . The concept also continues to play a role in science , with neuroscientists , psychologists and social scientists sometimes claiming that their results have yielded insight into human nature . Human nature is traditionally contrasted with characteristics that vary among humans , such as characteristics associated with specific cultures . Debates about human nature are related to , although not the same as , debates about the comparative importance of genes and environment in development ( nature versus nurture ) . The concept of nature as a standard by which to make judgments is traditionally said to have begun in Greek philosophy , at least as regards the Western and Middle Eastern languages and perspectives which are heavily influenced by it . The teleological approach of Aristotle came to be dominant by late classical and medieval times . By this account , human nature really causes humans to become what they become , and so it exists somehow independently of individuals . This in turn has been understood as also showing a special connection between human nature and divinity . This approach understands human nature in terms of final and formal causes .",

  "/wiki/Animal_Farm": "Animal Farm is an allegorical novella by George Orwell , first published in England on 17 August 1945 . The book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer , hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal , free , and happy . Ultimately , however , the rebellion is betrayed and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before , under the dictatorship of a pig named Napoleon . According to Orwell , the fable reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union . Orwell , a democratic socialist , was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism , an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War . [ a ] The Soviet Union , he believed , had become a brutal dictatorship , built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror . In a letter to Yvonne Davet , Orwell described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin ( un conte satirique contre Staline ) , and in his essay Why I Write ( 1946 ) , wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he tried , with full consciousness of what he was doing , to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole . The original title was Animal Farm : A Fairy Story , but U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946 , and only one of the translations during Orwell 's lifetime kept it . Other titular variations include subtitles like A Satire and A Contemporary Satire . Orwell suggested the title Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes animales for the French translation , which abbreviates to URSA , the Latin word for bear , a symbol of Russia . It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union , Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes sovi\u00e9tiques . Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944 , when the UK was in its wartime alliance with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany and the British people and intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem , a phenomenon Orwell hated .",
