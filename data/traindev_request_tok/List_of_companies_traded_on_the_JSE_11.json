  "/wiki/Integrated_circuit": "An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit ( also referred to as an IC , a chip , or a microchip ) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece ( or chip ) of semiconductor material that is normally silicon . The integration of large numbers of tiny MOS transistors into a small chip results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller , faster , and less expensive than those constructed of discrete electronic components . The IC 's mass production capability , reliability , and building-block approach to circuit design has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors . ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of electronics . Computers , mobile phones , and other digital home appliances are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies , made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs . Integrated circuits were made practical by technological advancements in metal-oxide-silicon ( MOS ) semiconductor device fabrication . Since their origins in the 1960s , the size , speed , and capacity of chips have progressed enormously , driven by technical advances that fit more and more MOS transistors on chips of the same size - a modern chip may have many billions of MOS transistors in an area the size of a human fingernail . These advances , roughly following Moore 's law , make computer chips of today possess millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s . ICs have two main advantages over discrete circuits : cost and performance . Cost is low because the chips , with all their components , are printed as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one transistor at a time . Furthermore , packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits . Performance is high because the IC 's components switch quickly and consume comparatively little power because of their small size and proximity .",
  "/wiki/Logistics": "Logistics is generally the detailed organization and implementation of a complex operation . In a general business sense , logistics is the management of the flow of things between the point of origin and the point of consumption to meet requirements of customers or corporations . The resources managed in logistics may include tangible goods such as materials , equipment , and supplies , as well as food and other consumable items . The logistics of physical items usually involves the integration of information flow , materials handling , production , packaging , inventory , transportation , warehousing , and often security . In military science , logistics is concerned with maintaining army supply lines while disrupting those of the enemy , since an armed force without resources and transportation is defenseless . Military logistics was already practiced in the ancient world and as modern military have a significant need for logistics solutions , advanced implementations have been developed . In military logistics , logistics officers manage how and when to move resources to the places they are needed . Logistics management is the part of supply chain management and supply chain engineering that plans , implements , and controls the efficient , effective forward , and reverse flow and storage of goods , services , and related information between point of origin and point of consumption to meet customer 's requirements . The complexity of logistics can be modeled , analyzed , visualized , and optimized by dedicated simulation software . The minimization of the use of resources is a common motivation in all logistics fields . A professional working in the field of logistics management is called a logistician .",
  "/wiki/Vehicle": "A vehicle ( from Latin : vehiculum ) is a machine that transports people or cargo . Vehicles include wagons , bicycles , motor vehicles ( motorcycles , cars , trucks , buses ) , railed vehicles ( trains , trams ) , watercraft ( ships , boats ) , amphibious vehicles ( screw-propelled vehicle , hovercraft ) , aircraft ( airplanes , helicopters ) and spacecraft . Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground : wheeled , tracked , railed or skied . ISO 3833-1977 is the standard , also internationally used in legislation , for road vehicles types , terms and definitions .",
  "/wiki/Aviation": "Aviation or air transport are the activities surrounding mechanical flight and the aircraft industry . Aircraft includes fixed-wing and rotary-wing types , morphable wings , wing-less lifting bodies , as well as lighter-than-air craft such as balloons and airships . Aviation began in the 18th century with the development of the hot air balloon , an apparatus capable of atmospheric displacement through buoyancy . Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of Otto Lilienthal in 1896 ; then a large step in significance came with the construction of the first powered airplane by the Wright brothers in the early 1900s . Since that time , aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the jet which permitted a major form of transport throughout the world .",
  "/wiki/Furniture": "Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating ( e.g. , chairs , stools , and sofas ) , eating ( tables ) , and sleeping ( e.g. , beds ) . Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work ( as horizontal surfaces above the ground , such as tables and desks ) , or to store things ( e.g. , cupboards and shelves ) . Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of decorative art . In addition to furniture 's functional role , it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose . It can be made from many materials , including metal , plastic , and wood . Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflect the local culture . People have been using natural objects , such as tree stumps , rocks and moss , as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation . Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago , people began constructing and carving their own furniture , using wood , stone , and animal bones . Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia , depicting the goddess on a throne . The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland , and includes cupboards , dressers and beds all constructed from stone . Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt . This era saw constructed wooden pieces , including stools and tables , sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory .",
  "/wiki/Home_appliance": "Home appliances , also known as domestic appliances , are electrical machines that help in household functions such as cooking , cleaning and food preservation . They are divided into the three classifications : small appliances , major appliances , or white goods , and consumer electronics , or brown goods in the United Kingdom . The division is also recognized in the maintenance and repair of these types of products . Brown goods typically require high technical knowledge and skills ( which get more complex with time , such as going from a soldering iron to a hot-air soldering station ) , while white goods may need more practical skills and force to manipulate the devices and heavy tools required to repair them .",

The company was founded in South Africa as the Liberty Life Association of Africa Ltd in 1957 , by entrepreneur and philanthropist Sir Donald Gordon .",
  "/wiki/Holding_company": "A holding company is a company that owns other companies ' outstanding stock . A holding company usually does not produce goods or services itself ( with no eponymous consumer-facing brand at most times ) ; rather , its purpose is to own shares of other companies to form a corporate group . However , in many jurisdiction of the world , holding companies are usually termed as parent companies who besides holding stock in other companies can conduct trade and other business activities itself . Holding companies allow the reduction of risk for the owners and can allow the ownership and control of a number of different companies . Holding companies are also created to hold assets such as IP and trade secrets that are protected from the operation company . This creates a smaller risk when it comes to litigation . In the United States , 80% of stock , in voting and value , must be owned before tax consolidation benefits such as tax-free dividends can be claimed . That is , if Company A owns 80% or more of the stock of Company B , Company A will not pay taxes on dividends paid by Company B to its stockholders , as the payment of dividends from B to A is essentially transferring cash from one company to the other . Any other shareholders of Company B will pay the usual taxes on dividends , as they are legitimate and ordinary dividends to these shareholders . Sometimes a company intended to be a pure holding company identifies itself as such by adding Holding or Holdings to its name .",
  "/wiki/Insurance": "Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss . It is a form of risk management , primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss . An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer , insurance company , insurance carrier or underwriter . A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder . The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer 's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss . The loss may or may not be financial , but it must be reducible to financial terms , and usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership , possession , or pre-existing relationship . The insured receives a contract , called the insurance policy , which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured . The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium . If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy , the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster . The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance , whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risk , especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry .",
  "/wiki/Healthcare": "Health care , health-care , or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention , diagnosis , treatment , recovery , or cure of disease , illness , injury , and other physical and mental impairments in people . Health care is delivered by health professionals in allied health fields . Physicians and physician associates are a part of these health professionals . Dentistry , pharmacy , midwifery , nursing , medicine , optometry , audiology , psychology , occupational therapy , physical therapy , athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care . It includes work done in providing primary care , secondary care , and tertiary care , as well as in public health . Access to health care may vary across countries , communities , and individuals , influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies . Providing health care services means the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes . Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations ( such as insurance coverage ) , geographic barriers ( such as additional transportation costs , possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services ) , and personal limitations ( lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers , poor health literacy , low income ) . Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services , efficacy of treatments , and overall outcome ( well-being , mortality rates ) . Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism , a well-trained and adequately paid workforce , reliable information on which to base decisions and policies , and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies . An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country 's economy , development and industrialization .",
  "/wiki/Hospitals": "A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment . The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital , which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness . A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region , with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care . Specialized hospitals include trauma centers , rehabilitation hospitals , children 's hospitals , seniors ' ( geriatric ) hospitals , and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment ( see psychiatric hospital ) and certain disease categories . Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals . Hospitals are classified as general , specialty , or government depending on the sources of income received . A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to medical students and nurses . A medical facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic . Hospitals have a range of departments ( e.g . surgery and urgent care ) and specialist units such as cardiology . Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units . Common support units include a pharmacy , pathology , and radiology .",

  "/wiki/Platinum": "Platinum is a chemical element with the symbol Pt and atomic number 78 . It is a dense , malleable , ductile , highly unreactive , precious , silverish-white transition metal . Its name is derived from the Spanish term platino , meaning little silver . Platinum is a member of the platinum group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of elements . It has six naturally occurring isotopes . It is one of the rarer elements in Earth 's crust , with an average abundance of approximately 5 \u03bcg/kg . It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits , mostly in South Africa , which accounts for 80% of the world production . Because of its scarcity in Earth 's crust , only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually , and given its important uses , it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity . Platinum is one of the least reactive metals . It has remarkable resistance to corrosion , even at high temperatures , and is therefore considered a noble metal . Consequently , platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum . Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers , it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts .",
  "/wiki/Mining": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth , usually from an ore body , lode , vein , seam , reef or placer deposit . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner . Ores recovered by mining include metals , coal , oil shale , gemstones , limestone , chalk , dimension stone , rock salt , potash , gravel , and clay . Mining is required to obtain any material that can not be grown through agricultural processes , or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory . Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum , natural gas , or even water . Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times . Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies , analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine , extraction of the desired materials , and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed . Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact , both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed . Hence , most of the world 's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact . Work safety has long been a concern as well , and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines . Levels of metal recycling are generally low . Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up , some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products .",

Infrastructure is composed of public and private physical improvements such as roads , railways , bridges , tunnels , water supply , sewers , electrical grids , and telecommunications ( including Internet connectivity and broadband speeds ) . In general , it has also been defined as the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable , sustain , or enhance societal living conditions .",
  "/wiki/Transport": "Transport or transportation is the movement of humans , animals and goods from one location to another . In other words , the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A to a point B. Modes of transport include air , land ( rail and road ) , water , cable , pipeline and space . The field can be divided into infrastructure , vehicles and operations . Transport enables trade between people , which is essential for the development of civilizations . Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations , including roads , railways , airways , waterways , canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports , railway stations , bus stations , warehouses , trucking terminals , refueling depots ( including fueling docks and fuel stations ) and seaports . Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance . Vehicles traveling on these networks may include automobiles , bicycles , buses , trains , trucks , helicopters , watercraft , spacecraft and aircraft . Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated , and the procedures set for this purpose , including financing , legalities , and policies . In the transport industry , operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private , depending on the country and mode . Passenger transport may be public , where operators provide scheduled services , or private . Freight transport has become focused on containerization , although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items . Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization , but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land .",
