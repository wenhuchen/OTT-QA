  "/wiki/Carousel": "A carousel ( American English : from French carrousel and Italian carosello ) , roundabout ( British English ) , or merry-go-round , is a type of amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders . The seats are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts , many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping , to the accompaniment of looped circus music . [ citation needed ] This leads to one of the alternative American names , the galloper ( however see direction of rotation below ) . Other popular names are jumper , horseabout , and flying horses . [ citation needed ] Carousels are commonly populated with horses , each horse weighing roughly 100 lbs ( 45 kg ) , but may include a variety of mounts , for example pigs , zebras , tigers , or mythological creatures such as dragons or unicorns . Sometimes , chair-like or bench-like seats are used , and occasionally mounts can be shaped like aeroplanes or cars . The roundabouts or merry-go-rounds installed in playgrounds are usually somewhat different devices : simple , child-powered rotating platforms with bars or handles to which children can cling while riding .",
  "/wiki/Euclid_Beach_Park": "Euclid Beach Park ( 1895 - September 28 , 1969 ) was a popular amusement park located on the southern shore of Lake Erie in the Collinwood neighborhood of Cleveland , Ohio . Originally incorporated by investors from Cleveland and patterned after New York 's Coney Island , the park was managed by William R. Ryan , Sr. , who ran the park with featured attractions including vaudeville acts , concerts , gambling , a beer garden , and sideshows as well as a few early amusement rides . In 1899 , Lee Holtzman became Euclid Beach 's new manager . Later that same year , as reported in a Cleveland newspaper , Euclid Beach Park had failed . Former management was faced with the loss of more than half their investment if they sold the land for building development , and it was established that the original Euclid Beach Park Company was losing twenty thousand dollars a season . Dudley S. Humphrey , Jr. led six members of his family in undertaking management of the park as of 1901 ( they had previously operated concessions at the park , but had been unhappy with the way Ryan ran it ) , leasing the park for five years at twelve thousand dollars a year . They expanded the beach and bathing facilities , including adding a lakeside swing , added many new attractions , and advertised to locals with the slogan , one fare , free gate and no beer . Designed to be a family-friendly park , the Humphreys would not admit anyone who had consumed intoxicating beverages at a bar directly across the street from the entrance to the park . Signs throughout the park instructed that only children were permitted to wear shorts , because the Humphreys thought that proper dress would promote a family-friendly atmosphere . At one point the park advertised that it would present nothing that would demoralize or depress , and that visitors would never be exposed to undesirable people , including African Americans . In August 1910 , the park was the site of an exhibition flight by aviator Glenn Curtiss from Euclid Beach to Cedar Point and back .",
  "/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places": "The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the United States federal government 's official list of districts , sites , buildings , structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance . A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . For most of its history , the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians . Occasionally , historic sites outside the country proper , but associated with the United States ( such as the American Embassy in Tangiers ) are also listed .",

  "/wiki/Drop_tower_(ride)": "A drop tower or big drop is a type of amusement ride incorporating a central structure or tower . Drop towers vary in height , passenger capacity , lift type , and brake type . Many are custom-made , although there are some mass-produced designs . Riders experience free-fall initially , followed by rapid heavy deceleration . With most drop towers , a gondola carrying riders is lifted to the top of a large vertical structure , then released to free-fall down the tower . Brakes activate to slow the gondola as it approaches the bottom of the ride . Some designs expand on this concept with features such as rotating gondolas , or several bounces before coming to rest . Most drop towers require child riders to exceed a minimum height ; limits vary widely depending upon the nature of the tower , with a 30-foot ( 9 m ) tower for smaller children from 37 inches ( 95 cm ) tall , and a 115-foot ( 35 m ) tower having a 51-inch ( 130 cm ) restriction . Drop towers use a magnetic braking system to slow the carriage quickly and smoothly once it reaches the bottom of the tower . This system is fail-safe because magnets do not need to be powered by electricity or other sources ; they work intrinsically by the laws of magnetism .",
