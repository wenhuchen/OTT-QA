  "/wiki/Princess_Jasmine": "Princess Jasmine is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures ' 31st animated feature film Aladdin ( 1992 ) . Voiced by American actress Linda Larkin - with a singing voice provided by Filipina singer Lea Salonga - Jasmine is the spirited Princess of Agrabah , who has grown weary of her life of palace confinement . Despite an age-old law stipulating that the princess must marry a prince in time for her upcoming birthday , Jasmine is instead determined to marry someone she loves for who he is as opposed to what he owns . Created by directors Ron Clements and John Musker with screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio , Jasmine is based on Badroulbadour , a princess who appears in the One Thousand and One Nights folktale Aladdin and the Magical Lamp . Originally conceived as a spoiled , materialistic princess , the writers eventually re-wrote Jasmine into a stronger and more prominent heroine following the elimination of Aladdin 's mother from the script , while borrowing story elements from the romantic comedy Roman Holiday ( 1953 ) . Several months after securing the role , Larkin was nearly fired from the project because Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg felt that her voice was not suitable for a princess , but Clements and Musker managed to convince him otherwise . Discovered by casting director Albert Tavares , Lea Salonga was cast as Jasmine 's singing voice based on her performance in the musical Miss Saigon ; this unprecedented casting decision made Jasmine the first Disney Princess to have her speaking and singing voices provided by two different actresses . Animated by Mark Henn , Jasmine 's design is an eclectic combination of unique sources , including an anonymous theme park guest , Henn 's own sister , and actress Jennifer Connelly . Unlike most of Disney 's princesses , Jasmine is a supporting character in her own film , taking the secondary role of the love interest . The character has garnered mixed-to-positive reviews , with much of her character arc compared unfavorably to her predecessors Ariel and Belle from The Little Mermaid ( 1989 ) and Beauty and the Beast ( 1991 ) but has been praised for her personality and her chemistry with Aladdin . As the sixth Disney Princess and the franchise 's first non-European member , the character is credited with introducing racial diversity to Disney 's princess genre . Jasmine has made subsequent appearances in Aladdin 's sequels The Return of Jafar ( 1994 ) and Aladdin and the King of Thieves ( 1996 ) , as well as its television series and a Broadway musical adaption of the film .",

The animators based their designs on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld , and computers were used for both finishing the artwork and creating some animated elements . The musical score was written by Alan Menken and features six songs with lyrics written by both Ashman and Tim Rice , who took over after Ashman 's death . Aladdin was released on November 25 , 1992 , to critical and commercial success , becoming the highest-grossing film of 1992 with an earn of over $ 504 million in worldwide box office revenue .

Her name uses the full moon as a metaphor for female beauty , which is common in Arabic literature and throughout the Arabian Nights . When Aladdin finds a magic lamp , he discovers it contains a jinni bound to do the bidding of the person holding the lamp . With the aid of the jinn , Aladdin - an impoverished young man who , in other circumstances , could not have aspired to marry a princess - becomes rich and powerful and marries Princess Badroulbadour . In Disney 's animated movie Aladdin , her name was changed to Jasmine and she was made an Arabian princess . She is also mentioned in a poem by Wallace Stevens called The Worms at Heaven 's Gate in his book Harmonium . She is a character in the children 's novel Wishing Moon by Michael O. Tunnell , and is portrayed as a scheming , black-hearted villainess . The name Badroulbadour also appears in the novels The Good Soldier by Ford Madox Ford , and The Turmoil by Booth Tarkington ( as 'Princess Bedrulbudour ' ) , and Come Dance with Me by Russell Hoban . Hoban also mentions Badoura as the name of an Arabian princess in The Arabian Nights . Monica Baldwin , in her novel The Called and the Chosen , uses the name Badroulbadour for the Siamese cat who belonged to her heroine , Ursula , before she became a nun .",

It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights , from the first English-language edition ( c. 1706 - 1721 ) , which rendered the title as The Arabian Nights ' Entertainment . The work was collected over many centuries by various authors , translators , and scholars across West , Central and South Asia , and North Africa . Some tales themselves trace their roots back to ancient and medieval Arabic , Persian , Indian , Greek , Jewish and Turkish folklore and literature . In particular , many tales were originally folk stories from the Abbasid and Mamluk eras , while others , especially the frame story , are most probably drawn from the Pahlavi Persian work Hez\u0101r Afs\u0101n ( Persian : \u0647\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u0633\u0627\u0646 , lit . A Thousand Tales ) , which in turn relied partly on Indian elements . What is common throughout all the editions of the Nights is the initial frame story of the ruler Shahry\u0101r and his wife Scheherazade and the framing device incorporated throughout the tales themselves . The stories proceed from this original tale ; some are framed within other tales , while others are self-contained . Some editions contain only a few hundred nights , while others include 1,001 or more . The bulk of the text is in prose , although verse is occasionally used for songs and riddles and to express heightened emotion . Most of the poems are single couplets or quatrains , although some are longer . Some of the stories commonly associated with The Nights , in particular Aladdin 's Wonderful Lamp , Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves , and The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor , were not part of The Nights in its original Arabic versions but were added to the collection by Antoine Galland and other European translators .",

Fox , Cree Summer , James Garner , Leonard Nimoy , Don Novello , Phil Morris , Claudia Christian , Jacqueline Obradors , Jim Varney ( in his final role ) , Florence Stanley , John Mahoney , David Ogden Stiers and Corey Burton . Set in 1914 , the film tells the story of a young man who gains possession of a sacred book , which he believes will guide him and a crew of mercenaries to the lost city of Atlantis . Development of the film began after production had finished on The Hunchback of Notre Dame ( 1996 ) . Instead of another musical , the production team decided to do an action-adventure film inspired by the works of Jules Verne . Atlantis was notable for adopting the distinctive visual style of comic book creator Mike Mignola . The film made greater use of computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) than any of Disney 's previous traditionally animated features , and it remains one of the few to have been shot in anamorphic format . Linguist Marc Okrand constructed an Atlantean language specifically for use in Atlantis . James Newton Howard provided the film 's score . The film was released at a time when audience interest in animated films was shifting away from hand-drawn animation toward films with full CGI .

  "/wiki/Atlantis": "Atlantis ( Ancient Greek : \u1f08\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 , island of Atlas ) is a fictional island mentioned within an allegory on the hubris of nations in Plato 's works Timaeus and Critias , where it represents the antagonist naval power that besieges Ancient Athens , the pseudo-historic embodiment of Plato 's ideal state in The Republic . In the story , Athens repels the Atlantean attack unlike any other nation of the known world , supposedly giving testament to the superiority of Plato 's concept of a state . The story concludes with Atlantis falling out of favor with the deities and submerging into the Atlantic Ocean . Despite its minor importance in Plato 's work , the Atlantis story has had a considerable impact on literature . The allegorical aspect of Atlantis was taken up in utopian works of several Renaissance writers , such as Francis Bacon 's New Atlantis and Thomas More 's Utopia . On the other hand , nineteenth-century amateur scholars misinterpreted Plato 's narrative as historical tradition , most famously in Ignatius L. Donnelly 's Atlantis : The Antediluvian World . Plato 's vague indications of the time of the events - more than 9,000 years before his time - and the alleged location of Atlantis - beyond the Pillars of Hercules - has led to much pseudoscientific speculation . As a consequence , Atlantis has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations and continues to inspire contemporary fiction , from comic books to films . While present-day philologists and classicists agree on the story 's fictional character , there is still debate on what served as its inspiration . As for instance with the story of Gyges , Plato is known to have freely borrowed some of his allegories and metaphors from older traditions . This led a number of scholars to investigate possible inspiration of Atlantis from Egyptian records of the Thera eruption , the Sea Peoples invasion , or the Trojan War . Others have rejected this chain of tradition as implausible and insist that Plato created an entirely fictional nation as his example , drawing loose inspiration from contemporary events such as the failed Athenian invasion of Sicily in 415-413 BC or the destruction of Helike in 373 BC .",

When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast , Belle offers him her own freedom in exchange for her father 's , and eventually learns to love the Beast despite his unsightly outward appearance . Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg commissioned Beauty and the Beast as an animated musical with a strong heroine and hired first-time screenwriter Linda Woolverton to write it . Basing her on the heroine of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont 's fairy tale Beauty and the Beast , Woolverton adapted Belle into a stronger and less passive character for the film . Inspired by the women 's rights movement , Woolverton wanted Belle to be a unique Disney heroine different from The Little Mermaid 's popular Ariel , and thus deliberately conceived the character as a feminist in an effort to avoid the criticism Disney had long been receiving due to the studio 's reputation of depicting its female characters as victims . Belle 's strength and love of reading was inspired by American actress Katharine Hepburn 's performance as Jo March in the film Little Women ( 1933 ) , while the writers instilled the adventure-seeking heroine with goals and aspirations beyond romance . However , the story artists and animators often contested Woolverton 's liberated vision for the character . Animated by James Baxter and Mark Henn , the former of whom based the character 's graceful gait on those of impressionist Edgar Degas ' ballerinas , Belle 's European facial features were inspired by those of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn . Several additional Hollywood actresses inspired Belle 's appearance , including Natalie Wood , Elizabeth Taylor , and Grace Kelly . Belle has garnered widespread acclaim from film critics who appreciated the character 's bravery , intelligence and independence . Reception towards her feminism , however , has been more mixed , with commentators accusing the character 's actions of being romance-oriented .",

Following the success of The Little Mermaid ( 1989 ) , Walt Disney Pictures decided to adapt the fairy tale , which Richard Purdum originally conceived as a non-musical .

  "/wiki/Red_hair": "Red hair ( or ginger hair ) occurs naturally in one to two percent of the human population , appearing with greater frequency ( two to six percent ) among people of Northern or Northwestern European ancestry and lesser frequency in other populations . It is most common in individuals homozygous for a recessive allele on chromosome 16 that produces an altered version of the MC1R protein . Red hair varies in hue from a deep burgundy or bright copper , or auburn , to burnt orange or red-orange to strawberry blond . Characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin , it is associated with fair skin color , lighter eye color , freckles , and sensitivity to ultraviolet light . Cultural reactions to red hair have varied from ridicule to admiration with many common stereotypes in existence regarding redheads . The term redhead has been in use since at least 1510 .",
  "/wiki/Blue_eyes": "Eye color is a polygenic phenotypic character determined by two distinct factors : the pigmentation of the eye 's iris and the frequency-dependence of the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris . :9 In humans , the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black , depending on the concentration of melanin in the iris pigment epithelium ( located on the back of the iris ) , the melanin content within the iris stroma ( located at the front of the iris ) , and the cellular density of the stroma . The appearance of blue and green , as well as hazel eyes , results from the Tyndall scattering of light in the stroma , a phenomenon similar to that which accounts for the blueness of the sky called Rayleigh scattering . Neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the human iris or ocular fluid . Eye color is thus an instance of structural color and varies depending on the lighting conditions , especially for lighter-colored eyes . The brightly colored eyes of many bird species result from the presence of other pigments , such as pteridines , purines , and carotenoids . Humans and other animals have many phenotypic variations in eye color . The genetics of eye color are complicated , and color is determined by multiple genes . So far , as many as 15 genes have been associated with eye color inheritance . Some of the eye-color genes include OCA2 and HERC2 . The earlier belief that blue eye color is a simple recessive trait has been shown to be incorrect . The genetics of eye color are so complex that almost any parent-child combination of eye colors can occur .",

Her speaking voice is provided by actress Ming-Na Wen , while singer Lea Salonga provides the character 's singing voice . Created by author Robert D. San Souci , Mulan is based on the legendary Chinese warrior Hua Mulan from the poem the Ballad of Mulan . The only child of an aging war veteran , Mulan disregards both tradition and the law by disguising herself as a man in order to enlist herself in the army in lieu of her feeble father . Disney had originally conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately elopes to Europe to be with a British prince . However , director Tony Bancroft , who was inspired by the well-being of his own daughters , wanted Mulan to be a different , unique kind of Disney heroine - one who is strong and independent , whose fate does not depend upon a male character . Thus , the relationship between Mulan and Captain Li Shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot , while Mulan 's bravery and strength were emphasized in order to ensure that she remained the hero of her own story . Mulan 's supervising animator was Mark Henn , who deliberately designed the character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors . Reception towards Mulan 's personality has been generally positive , with critics praising her bravery and heroism . However , some commentators have accused Disney of Westernizing the character , while her romantic relationship with Shang has been widely accused of compromising Mulan 's heroism .

  "/wiki/J._M._Barrie": "Sir James Matthew Barrie , 1st Baronet , OM ( /\u02c8b\u00e6ri/ ; 9 May 1860 - 19 June 1937 ) was a Scottish novelist and playwright , best remembered as the creator of Peter Pan . He was born and educated in Scotland and then moved to London , where he wrote a number of successful novels and plays . There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys , who inspired him to write about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens ( first included in Barrie 's adult novel The Little White Bird ) , then to write Peter Pan , or The Boy Who Would n't Grow Up , a fairy play about an ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland . Although he continued to write successfully , Peter Pan overshadowed his other work , and is credited with popularising the name Wendy . Barrie unofficially adopted the Davies boys following the deaths of their parents . Barrie was made a baronet by George V on 14 June 1913 , and a member of the Order of Merit in the 1922 New Year Honours . Before his death , he gave the rights to the Peter Pan works to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London , which continues to benefit from them .",
  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",
