  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

Spanning the eastern and western hemispheres , Oceania has a land area of 8,525,989 square kilometres ( 3,291,903 sq mi ) and a population of 42 million . Situated in the southeast of the Asia-Pacific region , Oceania , when compared to continental regions , is the smallest in land area and the second smallest in population after Antarctica . Oceania has a diverse mix of economies from the highly developed and globally competitive financial markets of Australia and New Zealand , which rank high in quality of life and human development index , to the much less developed economies that belong to countries such as Kiribati and Tuvalu , while also including medium-sized economies of Pacific islands such as Palau , Fiji and Tonga . The largest and most populous country in Oceania is Australia , with Sydney being the largest city of both Oceania and Australia . The first settlers of Australia , New Guinea , and the large islands just to the east arrived more than 60,000 years ago . [ citation needed ] Oceania was first explored by Europeans from the 16th century onward . Portuguese navigators , between 1512 and 1526 , reached the Tanimbar Islands , some of the Caroline Islands and west Papua New Guinea . On his first voyage in the 18th century , James Cook , who later arrived at the highly developed Hawaiian Islands , went to Tahiti and followed the east coast of Australia for the first time . The Pacific front saw major action during the Second World War , mainly between Allied powers the United States and Australia , and Axis power Japan . The arrival of European settlers in subsequent centuries resulted in a significant alteration in the social and political landscape of Oceania . In more contemporary times there has been increasing discussion on national flags and a desire by some Oceanians to display their distinguishable and individualistic identity .",

The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",

The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2% of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8% of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation .",

Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 .

Such contact is accepted as having occurred in prehistory during the human migrations that led to the original settlement of the Americas , but has been hotly debated in the historic period . Only one historical case of pre-Columbian contact is widely accepted among the scientific and scholarly mainstream .

Archaeologists have established that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe . Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe , the West Kennet Long Barrow belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows in Western Britain , now known as the Cotswold-Severn Group . Of these , it is part of a cluster of around thirty centring around Avebury in the uplands of northern Wiltshire . Built out of earth , local sarsen megaliths , and oolitic limestone imported from the Cotswolds , the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones . Its precise date of construction is not known . Human bones were placed within the chamber , probably between 3670 and 3635 BCE , representing a mixture of men , women , children and adults . There is then an apparent hiatus in the use of the site as a place of burial , probably lasting over a century . Between 3620 and 3240 BCE it likely began to be re-used as a burial space , receiving both human and animal remains over a period of several centuries .

  "/wiki/Minoan_civilization": "The Minoan civilization was a Bronze Age Aegean civilization on the island of Crete and other Aegean Islands , flourishing from c. 2700 to c. 1450 BC until a late period of decline , finally ending around 1100 BC . It represents the first advanced civilization in Europe , leaving behind massive building complexes , tools , stunning artwork , writing systems , and a massive network of trade . The civilization was rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century through the work of British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans . The name Minoan derives from the mythical King Minos and was coined by Evans , who identified the site at Knossos with the labyrinth and the Minotaur . The Minoan civilization has been described as the earliest of its kind in Europe , and historian Will Durant called the Minoans the first link in the European chain . The Minoan civilization is particularly notable for its large and elaborate palaces up to four stories high , featuring elaborate plumbing systems and decorated with frescoes . The most notable Minoan palace is that of Knossos , followed by that of Phaistos . The Minoan period saw extensive trade between Crete , Aegean , and Mediterranean settlements , particularly the Near East . Through their traders and artists , the Minoans ' cultural influence reached beyond Crete to the Cyclades , the Old Kingdom of Egypt , copper-bearing Cyprus , Canaan and the Levantine coast and Anatolia . Some of the best Minoan art is preserved in the city of Akrotiri on the island of Santorini , which was destroyed by the Minoan eruption . The Minoans primarily wrote in the undeciphered Linear A and also in undeciphered Cretan hieroglyphs , encoding a language hypothetically labelled Minoan . The reasons for the slow decline of the Minoan civilization , beginning around 1550 BC , are unclear ; theories include Mycenaean invasions from mainland Greece and the major volcanic eruption of Santorini .",

By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin .

The Sumerians and Akkadians ( including Assyrians and Babylonians ) dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of written history ( c. 3100 BC ) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC , when it was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire . It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC , and after his death , it became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire . Around 150 BC , Mesopotamia was under the control of the Parthian Empire . Mesopotamia became a battleground between the Romans and Parthians , with western parts of Mesopotamia coming under ephemeral Roman control . In AD 226 , the eastern regions of Mesopotamia fell to the Sassanid Persians . The division of Mesopotamia between Roman ( Byzantine from AD 395 ) and Sassanid Empires lasted until the 7th century Muslim conquest of Persia of the Sasanian Empire and Muslim conquest of the Levant from Byzantines .

  "/wiki/Kassites": "The Kassites ( /\u02c8k\u00e6sa\u026ats/ ) were people of the ancient Near East , who controlled Babylonia after the fall of the Old Babylonian Empire c. 1531 BC and until c. 1155 BC ( short chronology ) . The endonym of the Kassites was probably Galzu , although they have also been referred to by the names Ka\u0161\u0161u , Kassi , Kasi or Kashi . They gained control of Babylonia after the Hittite sack of the city in 1595 BC ( i.e . 1531 BC per the short chronology ) , and established a dynasty based first in Babylon and later in Dur-Kurigalzu . The Kassites were members of a small military aristocracy but were efficient rulers and not locally unpopular , and their 500-year reign laid an essential groundwork for the development of subsequent Babylonian culture . The chariot and the horse , which the Kassites worshipped , first came into use in Babylonia at this time . The Kassite language has not been classified . What is known is that their language was not related to either the Indo-European language group , nor to Semitic or other Afro-Asiatic languages , and is most likely to have been a language isolate although some linguists have proposed a link to the Hurro-Urartian languages of Asia Minor . However , the arrival of the Kassites has been connected to the contemporary migrations of Indo-European peoples . Several Kassite leaders and deities bore Indo-European names , and it is possible that they were dominated by an Indo-European elite similar to the Mitanni , who ruled over the Hurro-Urartian-speaking Hurrians of Asia Minor .",

The autobiography of Kurigalzu is one of the inscriptions which record that he was the son of Kada\u0161man-\u1e2aarbe . Galzu , whose possible native pronunciation was gal-du or gal-\u0161u , was the name by which the Kassites called themselves and Kurigalzu may mean Shepherd of the Kassites ( line 23 . Ku-ur-gal-zu = Ri-'-i-bi-\u0161i-i , in a Babylonian name-list ) . He was separated from his namesake , Kurigalzu II , by around forty-five years and as it was not the custom to assign regnal numbers and they both had lengthy reigns , this makes it exceptionally difficult to distinguish for whom an inscription is intended . The later king is , however , better known for his military campaign against the Assyrians than any building work he may have undertaken . It is now thought , however , that it was he who was the Kurigalzu who conquered Susa and was perhaps instrumental in the ascendancy of the Igehalkid dynasty over Elam , ca . 1400 BC .",

It is an exceptionally grand passage tomb built during the Neolithic period , around 3200 BC , making it older than Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids . The site consists of a large circular mound with an inner stone passageway and chambers . Human bones and possible grave goods or votive offerings were found in these chambers . The mound has a retaining wall at the front , made mostly of white quartz cobblestones , and it is ringed by engraved kerbstones . Many of the larger stones of Newgrange are covered in megalithic art . The mound is also ringed by a stone circle . Some of the material that makes up the monument came from as far away as the Mournes and Wicklow Mountains .

Archeological excavations from the chalcolithic Abealzu-Filigosa layers indicate the Monte d'Accoddi was used for animal sacrifice , with the remains of sheep , cattle , and swine recovered in near equal proportions . It is among the earliest known sacrificial sites in Western Europe , providing insight into the development of ritual in prehistoric society , and earning it a designation as the most singular cultic monument in the early Western Mediterranean . The site appears to have been abandoned again around 1800 BC , at the onset of the Nuragic age . Based on the evidence of architecture , ritual deposits and diagnostic pottery , G. and M. Webster have recently argued for the monument 's status as a foreign implant , specifically the product of a migration event ( probably exilic ) initiated from Mesopotamia , sometime during the first half of the 4th millennium B.C.E . < ref=G. & M.

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

It is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea after Sicily , and is located west of the Italian Peninsula , north of Tunisia , and to the immediate south of the French island of Corsica . The region of Sardinia is one of the five in Italy that enjoy some degree of domestic autonomy , granted by a specific Statute . Its official name is Regione Autonoma della Sardegna ( Sardinian : Regione Aut\u00f2noma de Sardigna , lit . Autonomous Region of Sardinia ) . It is divided into four provinces and a metropolitan city , with Cagliari being the region 's capital and also its largest city . Sardinia 's indigenous language and the other minority languages ( Sassarese , Gallurese , Algherese Catalan and Ligurian Tabarchino ) spoken on the island are recognized by the regional law and enjoy equal dignity with Italian . Sardinia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic . The island 's most iconic civilization is the indigenous Nuragic one , which lasted from the 18th century BC to either 238 BC or the 2nd century AD in some areas and to the 6th century AD in the region known as Barbagia . After a period under a political and economic alliance between the Nuragic Sardinians and the Phoenicians , the island was partly conquered by Carthage and Rome , in the late 6th century BC and in 238 BC respectively ; the Roman occupation lasted for 700 years , followed in the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals and the Byzantines . Since the island was finding itself disconnected from Byzantium 's scope of territorial influence , the Sardinians provided themselves with a self-ruling political organization , leading to the birth of the four Judicates . As the Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa struggled to exercise increasing political interference upon the indigenous states , the Crown of Aragon subsumed the island as the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1324 .",

The \u0120gantija temples are the earliest of the Megalithic Temples of Malta and are older than the pyramids of Egypt . Their makers erected the two \u0120gantija temples during the Neolithic ( c. 3600-2500 BC ) , which makes these temples more than 5500 years old and the world 's second oldest existing manmade religious structures after G\u00f6bekli Tepe in present-day Turkey . Together with other similar structures , these have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site , the Megalithic Temples of Malta . The temples are elements of a ceremonial site in a fertility rite . Researchers have found that the numerous figurines and statues found on site are associated with that cult . According to local Gozitan folklore , a giantess who ate nothing but broad beans and honey bore a child from a man of the common people . With the child hanging from her shoulder , she built these temples and used them as places of worship .",
  "/wiki/Malta": "The origin of the name Malta is uncertain , and the modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language . The most common etymology is that the word Malta is derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9 , meli , honey . The ancient Greeks called the island \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 ( Melit\u0113 ) meaning honey-sweet , possibly for Malta 's unique production of honey ; an endemic subspecies of bees live on the island . The Romans called the island Melita , which can be considered either a latinisation of the Greek \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b1 . In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration Melite in Acts 28:1 for \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f21 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 as found in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin . Melita is the spelling used in the Authorized ( King James ) Version of 1611 and in the American Standard Version of 1901 . Malta is widely used in more recent versions , such as The Revised Standard Version of 1946 and The New International Version of 1973 . Another conjecture suggests that the word Malta comes from the Phoenician word Maleth , a haven , or 'port ' in reference to Malta 's many bays and coves . Few other etymological mentions appear in classical literature , with the term Malta appearing in its present form in the Antonine Itinerary ( Itin . Marit . p. 518 ; Sil . Ital .",

It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture .

M\u0101ori originated with settlers from eastern Polynesia , who arrived in New Zealand in several waves of waka ( canoe ) voyages somewhere between 1320 and 1350 . Over several centuries in isolation , these settlers developed their own distinctive culture whose language , mythology , crafts and performing arts evolved independently from other eastern Polynesian cultures . The arrival of Europeans in New Zealand , starting in the 17th century , brought enormous changes to the M\u0101ori way of life . M\u0101ori people gradually adopted many aspects of Western society and culture . Initial relations between M\u0101ori and Europeans were largely amicable , and with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 , the two cultures coexisted . Rising tensions over disputed land sales led to conflict in the 1860s , and massive land confiscations . Social upheaval , and epidemics of introduced disease took a devastating toll on the M\u0101ori population , which fell dramatically .

With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country 's 85 federal subjects as of 2020 , Russia is the most populous nation in Europe and the ninth-most populous nation in the world . Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",
  "/wiki/Maikop_culture": "The Maykop culture ( scientific transliteration : Majkop , Russian : \u043c\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043e\u043f , [ mai.k\u0254p ] ) , c. 3700 BC-3000 BC , was a major Bronze Age archaeological culture in the western Caucasus region . It extends along the area from the Taman Peninsula at the Kerch Strait to near the modern border of Dagestan and southwards to the Kura River . The culture takes its name from a royal burial found in Maykop kurgan in the Kuban River valley . According to genetic studies on ancient DNA published in 2018 , the Maikop population came from the south , probably from western Georgia and Abkhazia , and was descended from the Eneolithic farmers who first colonized the north side of the Caucasus . Maykop is therefore the ideal archaeological candidate for the founders of the Northwest Caucasian language family ."
