Historically in Cumberland , it lies by road 38 miles ( 61 km ) south-west of Carlisle and 45 miles ( 72 km ) to the north of Barrow-in-Furness . It is the administrative seat of the Borough of Copeland , and has a town council for the parish of Whitehaven . The population of the town was 23,986 at the 2011 census . The town 's growth was largely due to the exploitation of the extensive coal measures by the Lowther family , driving a growing export of coal through the harbour from the 17th century onwards . It was also a major port for trading with the American colonies , and was , after London , the second busiest port of England by tonnage from 1750 to 1772 . This prosperity led to the creation of a Georgian planned town in the 18th century which has left an architectural legacy of over 170 listed buildings . Whitehaven has been designated a gem town by the Council for British Archaeology due to the historic quality of the town environment . Whitehaven was the site of a major chemical industry after World War II , but both that and the coal industry have disappeared , and today the major industry is the nearby Sellafield nuclear complex , which is the largest local employer of labour and has a significant administrative base in the town .
