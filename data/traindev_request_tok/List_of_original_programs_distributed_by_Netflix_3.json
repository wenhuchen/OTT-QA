  "/wiki/Black_comedy": "Black comedy , also known as black humor , dark comedy , dark humor or gallows humor , is a comic style that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo , particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss . Writers and comedians often use it as a tool for exploring vulgar issues , by provoking discomfort and serious thought as well as amusement in their audience . Thus , in fiction , for example , the term black comedy can also refer to a genre in which dark humor is a core component . Popular themes of the genre include death and violence , discrimination , disease , and human sexuality . Black comedy differs from both blue comedy - which focuses more on crude topics such as nudity , sex , and bodily fluids - and from straightforward obscenity . An archetypal example of black comedy in the form of self-mutilation appears in the English novel Tristram Shandy ; Tristram , five years old at the time , starts to urinate out of an open window for lack of a chamber pot . The sash falls and circumcises him ; his family reacts with both hysteria and philosophical acceptance . Whereas the term black comedy is a relatively broad term covering humor relating to many serious subjects , gallows humor tends to be used more specifically in relation to death , or situations that are reminiscent of dying . Black humor can occasionally be related to the grotesque genre . Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes .",
  "/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",

  "/wiki/Sitcom": "A sitcom , clipping for situational comedy ( situation comedy in the U.S. ) , is a genre of comedy centered on a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode . Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy , where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch , and stand-up comedy , where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience . Sitcoms originated in radio , but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms . A situational comedy television programme may be recorded in front of a studio audience , depending on the programme 's production format . The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track . During filming productions , the laugh track is usually pre-recorded . Critics disagree over the utility of the term sitcom in classifying shows that have come into existence since the turn of the century . Many contemporary American sitcoms use the single-camera setup and do not feature a laugh track , thus often resembling the dramedy shows of the 1980s and 1990s rather than the traditional sitcom . Other topics of debate have included whether or not cartoons , such as The Simpsons or Family Guy , can be classified as sitcoms .",

  "/wiki/Science_fantasy": "Science fantasy is a mixed genre within the umbrella of speculative fiction which simultaneously draws upon or combines tropes and elements from both science fiction and fantasy . In a science-fiction story , the world is scientifically possible , while a science-fantasy world contains elements which violate the scientific laws of the real world . Nevertheless , the world of science fantasy is logical and often is supplied with science-like explanations of these violations . During the Golden Age of Science Fiction , the fanciful science fantasy stories were seen in sharp contrast to the terse , scientifically plausible material that came to dominate mainstream science fiction typified by the magazine Astounding Stories . Although at this time , science fantasy stories were often relegated to the status of children 's entertainment , their freedom of imagination and romance proved to be an early major influence on the New Wave writers of the 1960s , who became exasperated by the limitations of hard SF . Distinguishing between science fiction and fantasy , Rod Serling claimed that the former was the improbable made possible while the latter was the impossible made probable . As a combination of the two , science fantasy gives a scientific veneer of realism to things that simply could not happen in the real world under any circumstances . Where science fiction does not permit the existence of fantasy or supernatural elements , science fantasy explicitly relies upon them . In explaining the intrigue of science fantasy , Carl D. Malmgren provides an intro in regards to C.S . Lewis speculation on the emotional needs at work in the subgenre : In the counternatural worlds of science fantasy , the imaginary and the actual , the magical and the prosaic , the mythical and the scientific , meet and interanimate . In so doing , these worlds inspire us with new sensations and experiences , with [ quoting C.S . Lewis ] 'such beauty , awe , or terror as the actual world does not supply ' , with the stuff of desires , dreams , and dread .",
  "/wiki/Television_comedy": "Television comedy had a presence from the earliest days of broadcasting . Among the earliest BBC television programmes in the 1930s was Starlight , which offered a series of guests from the music hall era , which often included singers and comedians . Similarly , many early United States television programs were variety shows including the Texaco Star Theater featuring Milton Berle ; comedy acts often taken from vaudeville were staples of such shows . The range of television comedy is extremely broad to the extent that anything under the heading comedy can be put before an audience through the medium of television . However , it is true to say that certain genres of comedy transfer to the small screen more successfully than others .",

  "/wiki/LGBT": "LGBT ( also acronymed as LGBTQ ( + ) or GLBT ) is an initialism that stands for lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender . In use since the 1990s , the term is an adaptation of the initialism LGB , which was used to replace the term gay in reference to the LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s . Activists believed that the term gay community did not accurately represent all those to whom it referred . The initialism has become adopted into the mainstream as an umbrella term for use when labeling topics pertaining to sexuality and gender identity . For example , the LGBT Movement Advancement Project termed community centres , which have services specific to those members of the LGBT community , as LGBT community centers , in a comprehensive studies of such centres around the United States . The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures . It may be used to refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender , instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgender . To recognize this inclusion , a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity ; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996 . Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI . The two acronyms are sometimes combined to form the terms LGBTIQ or LGBT+ to encompass spectrums of sexuality and gender . Other , less common variants also exist , motivated by a desire for inclusivity , including those over twice as long which have prompted criticism .",

  "/wiki/Mockumentary": "A mockumentary ( a portmanteau of mock and documentary ) or docucomedy is a type of movie or television show depicting fictional events but presented as a documentary . These productions are often used to analyze or comment on current events and issues by using a fictional setting , or to parody the documentary form itself . While mockumentaries are usually comedic , pseudo-documentaries are their dramatic equivalents . However , pseudo-documentary should not be confused with docudrama , a fictional genre in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events . Also , docudrama is different from docufiction ; a genre in which documentaries are contaminated with fictional elements . Mockumentaries are often presented as historical documentaries , with B roll and talking heads discussing past events , or as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pieces following people as they go through various events . Examples emerged during the 1950s when archival film footage became available . A very early example was a short piece on the Swiss Spaghetti Harvest that appeared as an April Fools ' prank on the British television program Panorama in 1957 . The term mockumentary , which originated in the 1960s , was popularized in the mid-1980s when This Is Spinal Tap director Rob Reiner used it in interviews to describe that film . Mockumentaries are often partly or wholly improvised , as an unscripted style of acting helps to maintain the pretense of reality . Comedic mockumentaries rarely have laugh tracks , also to sustain the atmosphere , although exceptions exist . Music is often employed to expose the ambiguities and fallacies of conventional storytelling ; for instance by pointing at the paradoxes of the distinction between diegetic and extradiegetic music .",
