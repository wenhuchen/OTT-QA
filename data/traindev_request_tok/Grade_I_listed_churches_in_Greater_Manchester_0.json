  "/wiki/Ashton-under-Lyne": "Ashton-under-Lyne is a market town in Tameside , Greater Manchester , England . The population was 45,198 at the 2011 census . Historically in Lancashire , it is on the north bank of the River Tame , in the foothills of the Pennines , 6.2 miles ( 10.0 km ) east of Manchester . Evidence of Stone Age , Bronze Age , and Viking activity has been discovered in Ashton-under-Lyne . The Ashton part of the town 's name probably dates from the Anglo-Saxon period , and derives from Old English meaning settlement by ash trees . The origin of the under-Lyne suffix is less clear ; it possibly derives from the British lemo meaning elm or from Ashton 's proximity to the Pennines . In the Middle Ages , Ashton-under-Lyne was a parish and township and Ashton Old Hall was held by the de Asshetons , lords of the manor . Granted a Royal Charter in 1414 , the manor spanned a rural area consisting of marshland , moorland , and a number of villages and hamlets . Until the introduction of the cotton trade in 1769 , Ashton was considered bare , wet , and almost worthless . The factory system , and textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution triggered a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area , and by the mid-19th century Ashton had emerged as an important mill town at a convergence of newly constructed canals and railways . Ashton-under-Lyne 's transport network allowed for an economic boom in cotton spinning , weaving , and coal mining , which led to the granting of municipal borough status in 1847 . In the mid-20th century , imports of cheaper foreign goods led to the decline of Ashton 's heavy industries but the town has continued to thrive as a centre of commerce and Ashton Market is one of the largest outdoor markets in the United Kingdom .",

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/England_in_the_Middle_Ages": "England in the Middle Ages concerns the history of England during the medieval period , from the end of the 5th century through to the start of the Early Modern period in 1485 . When England emerged from the collapse of the Roman Empire , the economy was in tatters and many of the towns abandoned . After several centuries of Germanic immigration , new identities and cultures began to emerge , developing into kingdoms that competed for power . A rich artistic culture flourished under the Anglo-Saxons , producing epic poems such as Beowulf and sophisticated metalwork . The Anglo-Saxons converted to Christianity in the 7th century and a network of monasteries and convents was built across England . In the 8th and 9th centuries England faced fierce Viking attacks , and the fighting lasted for many decades , eventually establishing Wessex as the most powerful kingdom and promoting the growth of an English identity . Despite repeated crises of succession and a Danish seizure of power at the start of the 11th century , it can also be argued that by the 1060s England was a powerful , centralised state with a strong military and successful economy . The Norman invasion of England in 1066 led to the defeat and replacement of the Anglo-Saxon elite with Norman and French nobles and their supporters . William the Conqueror and his successors took over the existing state system , repressing local revolts and controlling the population through a network of castles . The new rulers introduced a feudal approach to governing England , eradicating the practice of slavery , but creating a much wider body of unfree labourers called serfs . The position of women in society changed as laws regarding land and lordship shifted . England 's population more than doubled during the 12th and 13th centuries , fueling an expansion of the towns , cities , and trade , helped by warmer temperatures across Northern Europe .",

Born outside of the noble classes , a Greek , possibly in the Greek city of Drepana , Bithynia in Asia Minor , she became the consort of the future Roman Emperor Constantius Chlorus and the mother of the future Emperor Constantine the Great . Helena ranks as an important figure in the history of Christianity and of the world due to her influence on her son .

  "/wiki/Victorian_restoration": "The Victorian restoration was the widespread and extensive refurbishment and rebuilding of Church of England churches and cathedrals that took place in England and Wales during the 19th-century reign of Queen Victoria . It was not the same process as is understood today by the term building restoration . Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings ; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival ; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities , the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing . The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance . The principle was to restore a church to how it might have looked during the Decorated style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360 , and many famous architects such as George Gilbert Scott and Ewan Christian enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations . It is estimated that around 80% of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement , varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding . Influential people like John Ruskin and William Morris were opposed to such large-scale restoration , and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation , such as the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . In retrospect , the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light .",
  "/wiki/Battlement": "A battlement in defensive architecture , such as that of city walls or castles , comprises a parapet ( i.e. , a defensive low wall between chest-height and head-height ) , in which gaps or indentations , which are often rectangular , occur at intervals to allow for the launch of arrows or other projectiles from within the defences . These gaps are termed crenels ( also known as carnels , or embrasures ) , and a wall or building with them is called crenellated ; alternative ( older ) terms are castellated and embattled . The act of adding crenels to a previously unbroken parapet is termed crenellation . The function of battlements in war is to protect the defenders by giving them something to hide behind , from which they can pop out to launch their own missiles . A defensive building might be designed and built with battlements , or a manor house might be fortified by adding battlements , where no parapet previously existed , or cutting crenellations into its existing parapet wall . A distinctive feature of late medieval English church architecture is to crenellate the tops of church towers , and often the tops of lower walls . These are essentially decorative rather than functional , as are many examples on secular buildings . The solid widths between the crenels are called merlons . Battlements on walls have protected walkways ( chemin de ronde ) behind them . On tower or building tops , the ( often flat ) roof is used as the protected fighting platform .",
  "/wiki/Camber_beam": "In building , a camber beam is a piece of timber cut archwise , and steel bent or rolled , with an obtuse angle in the middle , commonly used in platforms as church leads , and other occasions where long and strong beams are required . The camber curve is ideally a parabola , but practically a circle segment as even with modern materials and calculations , cambers are imprecise . A camber beam is much stronger than another of the same size , since being laid with the hollow side downwards , as they usually are , they form a kind of supporting arch .",
  "/wiki/Gilding": "Gilding is any decorative technique for applying a very thin coating of gold to solid surfaces such as metal ( most common ) , wood , porcelain , or stone . A gilded object is also described as gilt . Where metal is gilded , it was traditionally silver in the West , to make silver-gilt ( or vermeil ) objects , but gilt-bronze is commonly used in China , and also called ormolu if it is Western . Methods of gilding include hand application and gluing , typically of gold leaf , chemical gilding , and electroplating , the last also called gold plating . Parcel-gilt ( partial gilt ) objects are only gilded over part of their surfaces . This may mean that all of the inside , and none of the outside , of a chalice or similar vessel is gilded , or that patterns or images are made up by using a combination of gilt and ungilted areas . Gilding gives an object a gold appearance at a fraction of the cost of creating a solid gold object . In addition , a solid gold piece would often be too soft or too heavy for practical use . A gilt surface also does not tarnish as silver does .",

  "/wiki/Effigy": "An effigy is a representation of a specific person in the form of sculpture or some other three-dimensional medium . The use of the term is normally restricted to certain contexts in a somewhat arbitrary way : recumbent effigies on tombs are so called , but standing statues of individuals , or busts , are usually not . Likenesses of religious figures in sculpture are not normally called effigies . Effigies are common elements of funerary art , especially as a recumbent effigy ( in a lying position ) in stone or metal placed on a tomb , or a less permanent funeral effigy , placed on the coffin in a grand funeral , wearing real clothing . Figures , often caricatural in style , that are damaged , destroyed or paraded in order to harm the person represented by magical means , or merely to mock or insult them or their memory , are also called effigies . It is common to burn an effigy of a person ( burn in effigy ) as an act of protest . The word is first documented in English in 1539 and comes , perhaps via French , from the Latin effigies , meaning representation . This spelling was originally used in English for singular senses : even a single image was the effigies of . ( This spelling seems to have been later reanalyzed as a plural , creating the singular effigy . ) In effigie was probably understood as a Latin phrase until the 18th century . The word occurs in Shakespeare 's As You Like It of 1600 ( II , vii , 193 ) , where scansion suggests that the second syllable is to be emphasized , as in the Latin pronunciation ( but unlike the modern English pronunciation ) .",

  "/wiki/Sandstone": "Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized ( 0.0625 to 2 mm ) mineral particles or rock fragments . Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar ( both silicates ) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth 's surface , as seen in the Goldich dissolution series . Like uncemented sand , sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals , but the most common colors are tan , brown , yellow , red , grey , pink , white , and black . Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features , certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions . Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities , making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs . Fine-grained aquifers , such as sandstones , are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices , such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity . Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism , usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts .",
  "/wiki/Slate": "Slate is a fine-grained , foliated , homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism . It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock . Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering , but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression . The foliation in slate is called slaty cleavage . It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression . When expertly cut by striking parallel to the foliation , with a specialized tool in the quarry , many slates will display a property called fissility , forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing , floor tiles , and other purposes . Slate is frequently grey in color , especially when seen , en masse , covering roofs . However , slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality ; for example , slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey , from pale to dark , and may also be purple , green or cyan . Slate is not to be confused with shale , from which it may be formed , or schist . The word slate is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock . It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate , or a writing slate . They were traditionally a small , smooth piece of the rock , often framed in wood , used with chalk as a notepad or notice board , and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns .",
  "/wiki/Terracotta": "Terracotta , terra cotta or terra-cotta ( pronounced [ \u02cct\u025brra\u02c8k\u0254tta ] ; Italian : baked earth , from the Latin terra cocta ) , a type of earthenware , is a clay-based unglazed or glazed ceramic , where the fired body is porous . Terracotta is the term normally used for sculpture made in earthenware , and also for various practical uses including vessels ( notably flower pots ) , water and waste water pipes , roofing tiles , bricks , and surface embellishment in building construction . The term is also used to refer to the natural brownish orange color of most terracotta , which varies considerably . [ citation needed ] This article covers the senses of terracotta as a medium in sculpture , as in the Terracotta Army and Greek terracotta figurines , and architectural decoration . Asian and European sculpture in porcelain is not covered . Glazed architectural terracotta and its unglazed version as exterior surfaces for buildings were used in Asia for some centuries before becoming popular in the West in the 19th century . Architectural terracotta can also refer to decorated ceramic elements such as antefixes and revetments , which made a large contribution to the appearance of temples and other buildings in the classical architecture of Europe , as well as in the Ancient Near East . [ citation needed ] In archaeology and art history , terracotta is often used to describe objects such as figurines not made on a potter 's wheel . Vessels and other objects that are or might be made on a wheel from the same material are called earthenware pottery ; the choice of term depends on the type of object rather than the material or firing technique . Unglazed pieces , and those made for building construction and industry , are also more likely to be referred to as terracotta , whereas tableware and other vessels are called earthenware ( though sometimes terracotta if unglazed ) , or by a more precise term such as faience .

  "/wiki/Rib_vault": "A rib vault is an architectural feature used to cover a large interior space in a building , usually the nave of a church or cathedral , in which the surface of the vault is divided into webs by a framework of diagonal arched ribs . It is also called a ribbed vault . It was a key feature of Gothic architecture . The thin stone ribs of the vault meet in a pointed arch , and carry the thrust of the weight of the roof outward and downwards to pillars on the ground floor , and to heavy flying buttresses outside the walls , rather than to the walls themselves . The use of rib vaults permitted the construction of much higher and thinner walls , and of stained glass windows of enormous size , which flooded the cathedrals with light . The rib vault was an improvement upon the earlier barrel vault , with semicircular arches , widely used by the Romans . An early version of the rib vault was used in the 8th century in Islamic Architecture , at the Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba in Moorish Spain , though it was decorative , not bearing the weight of the structure . They were also frequently used in later Romanesque and Norman architecture . Beginning in the 11th century , they were used in all of the major Gothic Cathedrals in Europe . Their form gradually changed from complex sexpartite vault to the simpler but stronger quadripartite vault , allowing the building of much higher cathedrals . By the thirteenth century , they had again become highly ornamental and complex , in such forms as the fan vault .",
  "/wiki/Pulpit": "A pulpit is a raised stand for preachers in a Christian church . The origin of the word is the Latin pulpitum ( platform or staging ) . The traditional pulpit is raised well above the surrounding floor for audibility and visibility , accessed by steps , with sides coming to about waist height . From the late medieval period onwards , pulpits have often had a canopy known as the sounding board or abat-voix above and sometimes also behind the speaker , normally in wood . Though sometimes highly decorated , this is not purely decorative , but can have a useful acoustic effect in projecting the preacher 's voice to the congregation below . Most pulpits have one or more book-stands for the preacher to rest his or her bible , notes or texts upon . The pulpit is generally reserved for clergy . This is mandated in the regulations of the Roman Catholic church , and several others ( though not always strictly observed ) . Even in Welsh Nonconformism , this was felt appropriate , and in some chapels a second pulpit was built opposite the main one for lay exhortations , testimonials and other speeches . Many churches have a second , smaller stand called the lectern , which can be used by lay persons , and is often used for all the readings and ordinary announcements . The traditional Catholic location of the pulpit to the side of the chancel or nave has been generally retained by Anglicans and some Protestant denominations , while in Presbyterian and Evangelical churches the pulpit has often replaced the altar at the centre . Equivalent platforms for speakers are the bema ( bima , bimah ) of Ancient Greece and Jewish synagogues , and the minbar of Islamic mosques .",

  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary .

  "/wiki/Timber_framing": "Timber framing and post-and-beam construction are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers , creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs . It is commonplace in wooden buildings through the 19th century . If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered , and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect . The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany . Timber framed houses are spread all over the country except in the southeast . The method comes from working directly from logs and trees rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber . Hewing this with broadaxes , adzes , and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers ( brace and bit ) and other woodworking tools , artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building .

  "/wiki/Paley,_Austin_and_Paley": "Sharpe , Paley and Austin are the surnames of architects who practised in Lancaster , Lancashire , England , between 1835 and 1946 , working either alone or in partnership . The full names of the principals in their practice , which went under various names during its life , are Edmund Sharpe ( 1809-77 ) ; Edward Graham Paley ( 1823-97 ) , who practised as E. G. Paley ; Hubert James Austin ( 1841-1915 ) ; Henry Anderson Paley ( 1859-1946 ) , son of Edward , usually known as Harry Paley ; and , for a very brief period , Geoffrey Langshaw Austin ( 1884-1971 ) , son of Hubert . The firm 's commissions were mainly for buildings in Lancashire and what is now Cumbria , but also in Yorkshire , Cheshire , the West Midlands , North Wales , and Hertfordshire . The practice specialised in work on churches ; the design of new churches , restoring older churches , and making additions or alterations . They also designed country houses , and made alterations to existing houses . Almost all their churches were designed in Gothic Revival style , except for some of Sharpe 's earliest churches and a few designed later by the practice . Within the Gothic Revival style , the practice initially used Early English and , particularly , Decorated features . E. G. Paley introduced Perpendicular elements , and Perpendicular became the dominant style used by the practice following the arrival of Hubert Austin , to such a degree that the firm became regarded as the regional leader in the use of that style . The practice used a greater variety of styles when working on country houses , including Elizabethan and Jacobean elements as well as Gothic . Other features were incorporated towards the end of the 19th century similar to those in works produced by the Aesthetic and the Arts and Crafts Movements .

  "/wiki/Art_Nouveau": "Art Nouveau ( /\u02cc\u0251\u02d0rt nu\u02d0\u02c8vo\u028a , \u02cc\u0251\u02d0r/ ; French : [ a\u0281 nuvo ] ) is an international style of art , architecture and applied art , especially the decorative arts , known in different languages by different names : Jugendstil in German , Stile Liberty in Italian , Modernisme in Catalan , etc . In English it is also known as the Modern Style ( not to be confused with Modernism and Modern architecture ) . The style was most popular between 1890 and 1910 . It was a reaction against the academic art , eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decoration . It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers . Other characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement , often given by asymmetry or whiplash lines , and the use of modern materials , particularly iron , glass , ceramics and later concrete , to create unusual forms and larger open spaces . One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts ( especially painting and sculpture ) and applied arts . It was most widely used in interior design , graphic arts , furniture , glass art , textiles , ceramics , jewelry and metal work . The style responded to leading 19-century theoreticians , such as French architect Eug\u00e8ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc ( 1814-1879 ) and British art critic John Ruskin ( 1819-1900 ) . In Britain , it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement . German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk ( total work of art ) that would unify the architecture , furnishings , and art in the interior in a common style , to uplift and inspire the residents . The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s , in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar , Henry van de Velde , and especially Victor Horta , whose H\u00f4tel Tassel was completed in 1893 .",
  "/wiki/Crossing_(architecture)": "A crossing , in ecclesiastical architecture , is the junction of the four arms of a cruciform ( cross-shaped ) church . In a typically oriented church ( especially of Romanesque and Gothic styles ) , the crossing gives access to the nave on the west , the transept arms on the north and south , and the choir , as the first part of the chancel , on the east . The crossing is sometimes surmounted by a tower or dome . A large crossing tower is particularly common on English Gothic cathedrals . With the Renaissance , building a dome above the crossing became popular . Because the crossing is open on four sides , the weight of the tower or dome rests heavily on the corners ; a stable construction thus required great skill on the part of the builders . In centuries past , it was not uncommon for overambitious crossing towers to collapse . Sacrist Alan of Walsingham 's octagon , built between 1322 and 1328 after the collapse of Ely 's nave crossing on 22 February 1322 , is the . greatest individual achievement of architectural genius at Ely Cathedral according to architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner . A tower over the crossing may be called a lantern tower if it has openings through which light from outside can shine down to the crossing . In Early Medieval churches , the crossing square was often used as a module , or a unit of measurement . The nave and transept would have lengths that were a certain multiple of the length of the crossing square .",

Exterior arcades are designed to provide a sheltered walkway for pedestrians . The walkway may be lined with retail stores . An arcade may feature arches on both sides of the walkway . Alternatively , a blind arcade superimposes arcading against a solid wall . Blind arcades are a feature of Romanesque architecture that influenced Gothic architecture . In the Gothic architectural tradition , the arcade can be located in the interior , in the lowest part of the wall of the nave , supporting the triforium and the clerestory in a cathedral , or on the exterior , in which they are usually part of the walkways that surround the courtyard and cloisters . Many medieval arcades housed shops or stalls , either in the arcaded space itself , or set into the main wall behind . From this , arcade has become a general word for a group of shops in a single building , regardless of the architectural form . The word arcade comes from French arcade from Proven\u00e7al arcada or Italian arcata , based on Latin arcus , bow ( see arc and arch ) .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Tuscan_order": "The Tuscan order ( Latin Ordo Tuscanicus or Ordo Tuscanus , with the meaning of Etruscan order ) is one of the two classical orders developed by the Romans , the other being the composite order . It is influenced by the Doric order , but with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae . While relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture , the Romans did not consider this style to be a distinct architectural order ( for example , the Roman architect Vitruvius did not include it alongside his descriptions of the Greek Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian orders ) . Its classification as a separate formal order was made during the Italian Renaissance . Sebastiano Serlio described five orders including a Tuscan order , the solidest and least ornate , in his fourth book of Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici ( 1537 ) . Though Fra Giocondo had attempted a first illustration of a Tuscan capital in his printed edition of Vitruvius ( 1511 ) , he showed the capital with an egg and dart enrichment that belonged to the Ionic . The most rustic Tuscan order of Serlio was later carefully delineated by Andrea Palladio . In its simplicity , the Tuscan order is seen as similar to the Doric order , and yet in its overall proportions , intercolumniation and simpler entablature , it follows the ratios of the Ionic . This strong order was considered most appropriate in military architecture and in docks and warehouses when they were dignified by architectural treatment . Serlio found it suitable to fortified places , such as city gates , fortresses , castles , treasuries , or where artillery and ammunition are kept , prisons , seaports and other similar structures used in war .",

  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) .

The full names of the principals in their practice , which went under various names during its life , are Edmund Sharpe ( 1809-77 ) ; Edward Graham Paley ( 1823-97 ) , who practised as E. G. Paley ; Hubert James Austin ( 1841-1915 ) ; Henry Anderson Paley ( 1859-1946 ) , son of Edward , usually known as Harry Paley ; and , for a very brief period , Geoffrey Langshaw Austin ( 1884-1971 ) , son of Hubert . The firm 's commissions were mainly for buildings in Lancashire and what is now Cumbria , but also in Yorkshire , Cheshire , the West Midlands , North Wales , and Hertfordshire . The practice specialised in work on churches ; the design of new churches , restoring older churches , and making additions or alterations . They also designed country houses , and made alterations to existing houses . Almost all their churches were designed in Gothic Revival style , except for some of Sharpe 's earliest churches and a few designed later by the practice . Within the Gothic Revival style , the practice initially used Early English and , particularly , Decorated features . E. G. Paley introduced Perpendicular elements , and Perpendicular became the dominant style used by the practice following the arrival of Hubert Austin , to such a degree that the firm became regarded as the regional leader in the use of that style . The practice used a greater variety of styles when working on country houses , including Elizabethan and Jacobean elements as well as Gothic . Other features were incorporated towards the end of the 19th century similar to those in works produced by the Aesthetic and the Arts and Crafts Movements . Not all the firm 's work was on a large scale ; as the major architectural practice in North West England they also undertook work on schools , vicarages , hospitals , factories , hotels , shops , railway stations , and war memorials .",
  "/wiki/Turret": "In architecture , a turret ( from Italian : torretta , little tower ; Latin : turris , tower ) is a small tower that projects vertically from the wall of a building such as a medieval castle . Turrets were used to provide a projecting defensive position allowing covering fire to the adjacent wall in the days of military fortification . As their military use faded , turrets were used for decorative purposes , as in the Scottish baronial style . A turret can have a circular top with crenelations as seen in the picture at right , a pointed roof , or other kind of apex . It might contain a staircase if it projects higher than the building ; however , a turret is not necessarily higher than the rest of the building ; in this case , it is typically part of a room , that can be simply walked into - see the turret of Chateau de Chaumont on the collection of turrets , which also illustrates a turret on a modern skyscraper . A building may have both towers and turrets ; turrets might be smaller or higher but turrets instead project from the edge of a building rather than continue to the ground . The size of a turret is therefore limited , since it puts additional stresses on the structure of the building . Turrets were traditionally supported by a corbel . In modern times , a gun turret is a weapon mount that houses the crew or mechanism of a projectile-firing weapon , allowing the weapon to be aimed and fired in some degree of azimuth and elevation . It can be found on warships , combat vehicles , military aircraft , and land fortifications , and usually offers some degree of armour or protection .",

  "/wiki/Lady_chapel": "A Lady chapel or lady chapel is a traditional British term for a chapel dedicated to Our Lady , the Blessed Virgin Mary , particularly those inside a cathedral or other large church . The chapels are also known as a Mary chapel or a Marian chapel , and they were traditionally the largest side chapel of a cathedral , placed eastward from the high altar and forming a projection from the main building as in Winchester Cathedral . Most Roman Catholic and many Anglican cathedrals still have such chapels , while mid-sized churches have smaller side-altars dedicated to the Virgin . The occurrence of lady chapels varies by location and exist in most of the French cathedrals and churches where they form part of the chevet . In Belgium they were not introduced before the 14th century ; in some cases they are of the same size as the other chapels of the chevet , but in others ( probably rebuilt at a later period ) they became much more important features . Some of the best examples can be found in churches of the Renaissance period in Italy and Spain .",

It is the administrative centre of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale , which had a population of 211,699 in 2011 . Historically part of Lancashire , Rochdale 's recorded history begins with an entry in the Domesday Book of 1086 under Recedham Manor . The ancient parish of Rochdale was a division of the hundred of Salford and one of the largest ecclesiastical parishes in England , comprising several townships . By 1251 , Rochdale had become important enough to have been granted a Royal charter . Rochdale flourished into a centre of northern England 's woollen trade , and by the early 18th century was described as being remarkable for many wealthy merchants . Rochdale rose to prominence in the 19th century as a mill town and centre for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution . It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution , and amongst the first industrialised towns . The Rochdale Canal - one of the major navigable broad canals of the United Kingdom - was a highway of commerce during this time used for the haulage of cotton , wool and coal to and from the area . The socioeconomic change brought by the success of Rochdale 's textile industry in the 19th century led to its rise to borough status and it remained a dominant settlement in its region . However , during the 20th century Rochdale 's spinning capacity declined towards an eventual halt . Rochdale is the birthplace of the modern Co-operative Movement , to which more than one billion people worldwide belonged in 2012 .",
  "/wiki/Freemasonry": "Freemasonry or Masonry consists of fraternal organisations that trace their origins to the local fraternities of stonemasons that from the end of the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients . The degrees of Freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds , those of Apprentice , Journeyman or fellow ( now called Fellowcraft ) , and Master Mason . The candidate of these three degrees is progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry , and entrusted with grips , signs and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated . The degrees are part allegorical morality play and part lecture . Three degrees are offered by Craft ( or Blue Lodge ) Freemasonry , and members of any of these degrees are known as Freemasons or Masons . There are additional degrees , which vary with locality and jurisdiction , and are usually administered by their own bodies ( separate from those who administer the Craft degrees ) . The basic , local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the Lodge . These private Lodges are usually supervised at the regional level ( usually coterminous with either a state , province , or national border ) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient . There is no international , worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry ; each Grand Lodge is independent , and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate . Modern Freemasonry broadly consists of two main recognition groups . Regular Freemasonry insists that a volume of scripture be open in a working lodge , that every member profess belief in a Supreme Being , that no women be admitted ( although , in some jurisdictions , those who transition to women after being initiated may stay ; see below ) , and that the discussion of religion and politics be banned . Continental Freemasonry is now the general term for the jurisdictions which have removed some , or all , of these restrictions .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Christian_Science": "Christian Science is a set of beliefs and practices belonging to the metaphysical family of new religious movements . [ n 2 ] It was developed in 19th-century New England by Mary Baker Eddy , who argued in her 1875 book Science and Health that sickness is an illusion that can be corrected by prayer alone .

Eddy and 26 followers were granted a charter in 1879 to found the Church of Christ , Scientist , and in 1894 the Mother Church , The First Church of Christ , Scientist , was built in Boston , Massachusetts . Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States , with nearly 270,000 members there by 1936 , a figure that had declined by 1990 to just over 100,000 , and by 2009 reportedly to under 50,000 . The church is known for its newspaper , The Christian Science Monitor , which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002 , and for its public Reading Rooms around the world . [ n 4 ] Eddy described Christian Science as a return to primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing . There are key differences between Christian Science theology and that of traditional Christianity . In particular , adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism , believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion . This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder , and that the sick should be treated not by medicine but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health . The church does not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care - adherents use dentists , optometrists , obstetricians , physicians for broken bones , and vaccination when required by law - but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine . Between the 1880s and 1990s , the avoidance of medical treatment led to the deaths of several adherents and their children .",

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",
  "/wiki/Portico": "A portico is a porch leading to the entrance of a building , or extended as a colonnade , with a roof structure over a walkway , supported by columns or enclosed by walls . This idea was widely used in ancient Greece and has influenced many cultures , including most Western cultures . Some noteworthy examples of porticos are the East Portico of the United States Capitol , the portico adorning the Pantheon in Rome and the portico of University College London . Porticos are sometimes topped with pediments . Palladio was a pioneer of using temple-fronts for secular buildings . In the UK , the temple-front applied to The Vyne , Hampshire , was the first portico applied to an English country house . A pronaos ( UK : /pro\u028a\u02c8ne\u026a.\u0252s/ or US : /pro\u028a\u02c8ne\u026a.\u0259s/ ) is the inner area of the portico of a Greek or Roman temple , situated between the portico 's colonnade or walls and the entrance to the cella , or shrine . Roman temples commonly had an open pronaos , usually with only columns and no walls , and the pronaos could be as long as the cella . The word pronaos is Greek for before a temple . In Latin , a pronaos is also referred to as an anticum or prodomus .",
  "/wiki/Ionic_order": "The Ionic order forms one of the three classical orders of classical architecture , the other two canonic orders being the Doric and the Corinthian . There are two lesser orders : the Tuscan ( a plainer Doric ) , and the rich variant of Corinthian called the composite order , both added by 16th-century Italian architectural writers , based on Roman practice . Of the three canonic orders , the Ionic order has the narrowest columns . The Ionic capital is characterized by the use of volutes . The Ionic columns normally stand on a base which separates the shaft of the column from the stylobate or platform ; the cap is usually enriched with egg-and-dart . Since Vitruvius , a female character has been ascribed to the Ionic ( in contrast to the masculine Doric ) .",
  "/wiki/Corinthian_order": "The Corinthian order is the last developed of the three principal classical orders of ancient Greek and Roman architecture . The other two are the Doric order which was the earliest , followed by the Ionic order . When classical architecture was revived during the Renaissance , two more orders were added to the canon : the Tuscan order and the Composite order . The Corinthian , with its offshoot the Composite , is the most ornate of the orders . This architectural style is characterized by slender fluted columns and elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves and scrolls . There are many variations . The name Corinthian is derived from the ancient Greek city of Corinth , although the style had its own model in Roman practice , following precedents set by the Temple of Mars Ultor in the Forum of Augustus ( c. 2 AD ) . It was employed in southern Gaul at the Maison Carr\u00e9e , N\u00eemes and at the comparable Temple of Augustus and Livia [ fr ] at Vienne . Other prime examples noted by Mark Wilson Jones are the lower order of the Basilica Ulpia and the Arch of Trajan at Ancona ( both of the reign of Trajan , 98-117 AD ) , the Column of Phocas ( re-erected in Late Antiquity but 2nd century in origin ) , and the Temple of Bacchus at Baalbek ( c. 150 AD ) .",

  "/wiki/Rose_window": "Rose window is often used as a generic term applied to a circular window , but is especially used for those found in churches of the Gothic architectural style that are divided into segments by stone mullions and tracery . The term rose window was not used before the 17th century and according to the Oxford English Dictionary , among other authorities , comes from the English flower name rose . The name wheel window is often applied to a window divided by simple spokes radiating from a central boss or opening , while the term rose window is reserved for those windows , sometimes of a highly complex design , which can be seen to bear similarity to a multi-petalled rose . Rose windows are also called Catherine windows after Saint Catherine of Alexandria , who was sentenced to be executed on a spiked breaking wheel . A circular window without tracery such as are found in many Italian churches , is referred to as an ocular window or oculus . Rose windows are particularly characteristic of Gothic architecture and may be seen in all the major Gothic Cathedrals of Northern France . Their origins are much earlier and rose windows may be seen in various forms throughout the Medieval period . Their popularity was revived , with other medieval features , during the Gothic revival of the 19th century so that they are seen in Christian churches all over the world .",
