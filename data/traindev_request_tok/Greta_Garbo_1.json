  "/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress": "The Academy Award for Best Actress is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) . It is given in honor of an actress who has delivered an outstanding performance in a leading role while working within the film industry . The award is traditionally presented by the previous year 's Best Actor winner . The 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with Janet Gaynor receiving the award for her roles in 7th Heaven , Street Angel , and Sunrise . Currently , nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the actors branch of AMPAS ; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the Academy . In the first three years of the awards , actresses were nominated as the best in their categories . At that time , all of their work during the qualifying period ( as many as three films , in some cases ) was listed after the award . However , during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930 , only one of those films was cited in each winner 's final award , even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots . The following year , this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the current system in which an actress is nominated for a specific performance in a single film . Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937 , the category was officially limited to five nominations per year . One actress has been nominated posthumously , Jeanne Eagels . Since its inception , the award has been given to 76 actresses .",
