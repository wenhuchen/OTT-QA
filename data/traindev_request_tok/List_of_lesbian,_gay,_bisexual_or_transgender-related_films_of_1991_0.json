Jove and Ganymede in Dido , Henry III and his 'minions ' in The Massacre , Neptune and Leander in Hero and Leander , and all akin , although drawn to a slighter scale , to Edward and Gaveston . Boas also notes the existence of a number of parallels between Edward II and The Massacre at Paris , asserting that it is scarcely too much to say that scenes xi-xxi of The Massacre are something in the nature of a preliminary sketch for Edward II .

His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history . In 1969 , he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife , Yoko Ono . After the Beatles disbanded in 1970 , Lennon continued as a solo artist and as Ono 's collaborator . Born in Liverpool , Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager . In 1956 , he formed his first band , the Quarrymen , which evolved into the Beatles in 1960 . He was initially the group 's de facto leader , a role gradually ceded to McCartney . Lennon was characterised for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music , writing , drawings , on film and in interviews . In the mid-1960s , he had two books published : In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works , both collections of nonsensical writings and line drawings . Starting with 1967 's All You Need Is Love , his lyrics espoused a pacifist message , and some of his songs were soon adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture . From 1968 to 1972 , Lennon produced more than a dozen records with Ono , including a trilogy of avant-garde albums , his first solo LP John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band , and the international top 10 singles Give Peace a Chance , Instant Karma ! , Imagine and Happy Xmas ( War Is Over ) .

  "/wiki/The_Beatles": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960 . With a line-up comprising John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they are regarded as the most influential band of all time . The group were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music 's recognition as an art form . Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways ; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock . As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 . As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed Beatlemania , the band acquired the nickname the Fab Four , with Epstein , Martin and other members of the band 's entourage sometimes given the informal title of fifth Beatle . By early 1964 , the Beatles were international stars , leading the British Invasion of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records . They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day 's Night ( 1964 ) . From 1965 onwards , they produced increasingly innovative recordings , including the albums Rubber Soul ( 1965 ) , Revolver ( 1966 ) and Sgt .",

He was referred to as the fifth Beatle due to his role in the group 's business affairs , image and rise to global fame . Epstein was born into a family of successful retailers in Liverpool , who put him in charge of their music shop . Here he displayed a gift for talent-spotting . He first met the Beatles in 1961 at a lunchtime concert at Liverpool 's Cavern Club . Although he had no experience of artist management , Epstein put them under contract and insisted that they abandon their scruff-image in favour of a new clean-cut style , with identical suits and haircuts . He then persuaded George Martin of EMI group to produce their records . Within months , the Beatles were international stars . Epstein accompanied them to America , where he was besieged by merchandising offers , but had signed away 90 per cent of the rights in advance . This is viewed as his one miscalculation .

The story follows two friends , Mike and Scott , as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland , Oregon to Mike 's hometown in Idaho , and then to Rome in search of Mike 's mother . Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s , but discarded it after reading John Rechy 's 1963 novel City of Night and concluding that Rechy 's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own . Over the years , Van Sant rewrote the script , which comprised two stories : that of Mike and the search for his mother , and Scott 's story as a modern update of the Henry IV plays . Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing , and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids . After he sent copies of his script to Reeves , and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix , both agreed to star in the film on each other 's behalf . My Own Private Idaho had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival , and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of The New York Times and Entertainment Weekly . The film was a moderate financial success , grossing over $ 6.4 million in North America , above its estimated budget of $ 2.5 million .

  "/wiki/Brian_Wilson": "Brian Douglas Wilson ( born June 20 , 1942 ) is an American musician , singer , songwriter , and record producer who co-founded the Beach Boys . After signing with Capitol Records in 1962 , Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group . In addition to his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques , Wilson is known for his lifelong struggles with mental illness . He is often referred to as a genius and is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century . The Beach Boys were formed by Wilson with his brothers Dennis and Carl , their cousin Mike Love , and friend Al Jardine . Brian , who grew up influenced by 1950s rock and roll and jazz-based vocal groups , originally functioned as the band 's songwriter , producer , co-lead vocalist , bassist , keyboardist , and de facto leader . In 1964 , he suffered a nervous breakdown and stopped touring with the group , which led to more personal work such as Pet Sounds ( 1966 ) and the unfinished Smile . As his mental health deteriorated , his contributions to the band diminished , and over the next decade , he was reputed for his reclusive lifestyle and substance abuse . Following a 1992 court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist Eugene Landy , Wilson started receiving conventional medical treatment , and in the late 1990s , he began performing and recording consistently as a solo artist . He remains a member of the Beach Boys ' corporation , Brother Records Inc. Wilson was the first pop artist credited for writing , arranging , producing , and performing his own material . He is considered a major innovator in the field of music production , the principal originator of the California Sound , one of the first music producer auteurs , and the first rock producer to use the studio as its own instrument . The unusual creative control Capitol gave him over his own records effectively set a precedent that allowed other bands and artists to act as their own producers or co-producers .",
  "/wiki/History_(theatrical_genre)": "History is one of the three main genres in Western theatre alongside tragedy and comedy , although it originated , in its modern form , thousands of years later than the other primary genres . For this reason , it is often treated as a subset of tragedy . A play in this genre is known as a history play and is based on a historical narrative , often set in the medieval or early modern past . History emerged as a distinct genre from tragedy in Renaissance England . The best known examples of the genre are the history plays written by William Shakespeare , whose plays still serve to define the genre . History plays also appear elsewhere in British and Western literature , such as Thomas Heywood 's Edward IV , Schiller 's Mary Stuart or the Dutch genre Gijsbrecht van Aemstel .",
  "/wiki/Henry_IV,_Part_1": "Henry IV , Part 1 is a history play by William Shakespeare , believed to have been written no later than 1597 . It is the second play in Shakespeare 's tetralogy dealing with the successive reigns of Richard II , Henry IV ( two plays , including Henry IV , Part 2 ) , and Henry V. Henry IV , Part 1 depicts a span of history that begins with Hotspur 's battle at Homildon in Northumberland against Douglas late in 1402 and ends with the defeat of the rebels at Shrewsbury in the middle of 1403 . From the start , it has been an extremely popular play both with the public and critics .",
  "/wiki/Henry_IV,_Part_2": "Henry IV , Part 2 is a history play by William Shakespeare believed to have been written between 1596 and 1599 . It is the third part of a tetralogy , preceded by Richard II and Henry IV , Part 1 and succeeded by Henry V. The play is often seen as an extension of aspects of Henry IV , Part 1 , rather than a straightforward continuation of the historical narrative , placing more emphasis on the highly popular character of Falstaff and introducing other comic figures as part of his entourage , including Ancient Pistol , Doll Tearsheet , and Justice Robert Shallow . Several scenes specifically parallel episodes in Part 1 .",
  "/wiki/Henry_V_(play)": "Henry V is a history play by William Shakespeare , believed to have been written near 1599 . It tells the story of King Henry V of England , focusing on events immediately before and after the Battle of Agincourt ( 1415 ) during the Hundred Years ' War . In the First Quarto text , it was titled The Cronicle History of Henry the fift , :p.6 which became The Life of Henry the Fifth in the First Folio text . The play is the final part of a tetralogy , preceded by Richard II , Henry IV , Part 1 , and Henry IV , Part 2 . The original audiences would thus have already been familiar with the title character , who was depicted in the Henry IV plays as a wild , undisciplined young man . In Henry V , the young prince has matured . He embarks on an expedition to France and , his army badly outnumbered , defeats the French at Agincourt .",
  "/wiki/William_Shakespeare": "William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 - 23 April 1616 ) [ a ] was an English poet , playwright , and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the Bard of Avon ( or simply the Bard ) . [ b ] His extant works , including collaborations , consist of some 39 plays , [ c ] 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613 . [ d ] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres .",
