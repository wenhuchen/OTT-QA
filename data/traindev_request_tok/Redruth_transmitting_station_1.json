  "/wiki/MHz": "The hertz ( symbol : Hz ) is the derived unit of frequency in the International System of Units ( SI ) and is defined as one cycle per second . It is named after Heinrich Rudolf Hertz , the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves . Hertz are commonly expressed in multiples : kilohertz ( 103 Hz , kHz ) , megahertz ( 106 Hz , MHz ) , gigahertz ( 109 Hz , GHz ) , terahertz ( 1012 Hz , THz ) , petahertz ( 1015 Hz , PHz ) , exahertz ( 1018 Hz , EHz ) , and zettahertz ( 1021 Hz , ZHz ) . Some of the unit 's most common uses are in the description of sine waves and musical tones , particularly those used in radio- and audio-related applications . It is also used to describe the clock speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven . The units are sometimes also used as a representation of energy , via the photon energy equation ( E=h\u03bd ) , with one hertz equivalent to h joules .",
