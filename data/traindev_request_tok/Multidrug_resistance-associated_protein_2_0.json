  "/wiki/Probenecid": "Probenecid , also sold under the brand name Probalan , is a medication that increases uric acid excretion in the urine . It is primarily used in treating gout and hyperuricemia . Probenecid was developed as an alternative to caronamide to competitively inhibit renal excretion of some drugs , thereby increasing their plasma concentration and prolonging their effects .",
  "/wiki/Uricosuric": "Uricosuric medications ( drugs ) are substances that increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine , thus reducing the concentration of uric acid in blood plasma . In general , this effect is achieved by action on the proximal tubule of the kidney . Drugs that reduce blood uric acid are not all uricosurics ; blood uric acid can be reduced by other mechanisms ( see other Antigout medications ) . Uricosurics are often used in the treatment of gout , a disease in which uric acid crystals form deposits in the joints . By decreasing plasma uric acid levels , uricosurics help dissolve these crystals , while limiting the formation of new ones . However , the increased uric acid levels in urine can contribute to kidney stones . Thus , use of these drugs is contraindicated in persons already with a high urine concentration of uric acid ( hyperuricosuria ) . In borderline cases , enough water to produce 2 liters of urine per day may be sufficient to permit use of an uricosuric drug . By their mechanism of action , some uricosurics ( such as probenecid ) increase the blood plasma concentration of certain other drugs and their metabolic products . While this is occasionally exploitable to good effect ( see oseltamivir ) , assessment of drug interactions is very important when using uricosuric drugs in the presence of other medications .",
  "/wiki/Gout": "Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red , tender , hot , and swollen joint . Pain typically comes on rapidly , reaching maximal intensity in less than 12 hours . The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases . It may also result in tophi , kidney stones , or kidney damage . Gout is due to persistently elevated levels of uric acid in the blood . This occurs from a combination of diet , other health problems , and genetic factors . At high levels , uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints , tendons , and surrounding tissues , resulting in an attack of gout . Gout occurs more commonly in those who regularly eat meat or seafood , drink beer , or are overweight . Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by the presence of crystals in the joint fluid or in a deposit outside the joint . Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack . Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , steroids , or colchicine improves symptoms . Once the acute attack subsides , levels of uric acid can be lowered via lifestyle changes and in those with frequent attacks , allopurinol or probenecid provides long-term prevention .",
  "/wiki/Hyperuricemia": "Hyperuricemia is an abnormally high level of uric acid in the blood . In the pH conditions of body fluid , uric acid exists largely as urate , the ion form . The amount of urate in the body depends on the balance between the amount of purines eaten in food , the amount of urate synthesised within the body ( e.g. , through cell turnover ) , and the amount of urate that is excreted in urine or through the gastrointestinal tract . In humans , the upper end of the normal range is 360 \u00b5mol/L ( 6 mg/dL ) for women and 400 \u00b5mol/L ( 6.8 mg/dL ) for men .",
  "/wiki/Furosemide": "Furosemide , sold under the brand name Lasix among others , is a medication used to treat fluid build-up due to heart failure , liver scarring , or kidney disease . It may also be used for the treatment of high blood pressure . It can be taken by injection into a vein or by mouth . When taken by mouth , it typically begins working within an hour , while intravenously , it typically begins working within five minutes . Common side effects include feeling lightheaded with standing , ringing in the ears , and sensitivity to light . Potentially serious side effects include electrolyte abnormalities , low blood pressure , and hearing loss . Blood tests are recommended regularly for those on treatment . Furosemide is a type of loop diuretic that works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys . Furosemide was patented in 1959 and approved for medical use in 1964 . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system . The wholesale price in the developing world is between US $ 0.004 and US $ 0.02 per day . In the United States , it is available as a generic medication and costs about US $ 0.15 per day .",
  "/wiki/Loop_diuretic": "Loop diuretics are diuretics that act at the ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney . They are primarily used in medicine to treat hypertension and edema often due to congestive heart failure or chronic kidney disease . While thiazide diuretics are more effective in patients with normal kidney function , loop diuretics are more effective in patients with impaired kidney function .",
  "/wiki/Heart_failure": "Heart failure ( HF ) , also known as congestive heart failure ( CHF ) and congestive cardiac failure ( CCF ) , is when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body 's needs . Signs and symptoms of heart failure commonly include shortness of breath , excessive tiredness , and leg swelling . The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise or while lying down , and may wake the person at night . A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature . Chest pain , including angina , does not typically occur due to heart failure . Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease , including a previous myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) , high blood pressure , atrial fibrillation , valvular heart disease , excess alcohol use , infection , and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause . These cause heart failure by changing either the structure or the function of the heart . The two types of left ventricular heart failure - heart failure with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) , and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) - are based on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract , or to relax , is affected . The severity of the heart failure is graded by the severity of symptoms with exercise . Heart failure is not the same as heart attack ( in which part of the heart muscle dies ) or cardiac arrest ( in which blood flow stops altogether ) . Other diseases that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity , kidney failure , liver problems , anemia , and thyroid disease . Diagnosis is based on symptoms , physical findings , and echocardiography .",
  "/wiki/Edema": "Edema , also known as fluid retention or swelling , is the build up of fluid in the body 's tissue . Most commonly the legs or arms are affected . Symptoms may include skin which feels tight , the area may feel heavy , and affected joints may be hard to move . Other symptoms depend on the underlying cause . Causes may include venous insufficiency , heart failure , kidney problems , low protein levels , liver problems , deep vein thrombosis , infections , angioedema , certain medications , and lymphedema . It may also occur due to prolonged sitting or standing and during menstruation or pregnancy . The condition is more concerning if it starts suddenly , or pain or shortness of breath is present . Treatment depends on the underlying cause . If the underlying mechanism involves sodium retention , decreased salt intake and a diuretic may be used . Elevating the legs and support stockings may be useful for edema of the legs . Older people are more commonly affected . The word is from the Greek \u03bf\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 o\u00edd\u0113ma meaning swelling .",

  "/wiki/Antiretroviral": "The management of HIV/AIDS normally includes the use of multiple antiretroviral drugs in an attempt to control HIV infection . There are several classes of antiretroviral agents that act on different stages of the HIV life-cycle . The use of multiple drugs that act on different viral targets is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . HAART decreases the patient 's total burden of HIV , maintains function of the immune system , and prevents opportunistic infections that often lead to death . HAART also prevents the transmission of HIV between serodiscordant same sex and opposite sex partners so long as the HIV-positive partner maintains an undetectable viral load . Treatment has been so successful that in many parts of the world , HIV has become a chronic condition in which progression to AIDS is increasingly rare . Anthony Fauci , head of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , has written , With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come , an AIDS-free generation is indeed within reach . In the same paper , he noted that an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone by antiretroviral therapy . As another commentary in The Lancet noted , Rather than dealing with acute and potentially life-threatening complications , clinicians are now confronted with managing a chronic disease that in the absence of a cure will persist for many decades . The United States Department of Health and Human Services and the World Health Organization recommend offering antiretroviral treatment to all patients with HIV . Because of the complexity of selecting and following a regimen , the potential for side effects , and the importance of taking medications regularly to prevent viral resistance , such organizations emphasize the importance of involving patients in therapy choices and recommend analyzing the risks and the potential benefits . The World Health Organization has defined health as more than the absence of disease .",

Antiviral drugs are one class of antimicrobials , a larger group which also includes antibiotic ( also termed antibacterial ) , antifungal and antiparasitic drugs , or antiviral drugs based on monoclonal antibodies . Most antivirals are considered relatively harmless to the host , and therefore can be used to treat infections .
