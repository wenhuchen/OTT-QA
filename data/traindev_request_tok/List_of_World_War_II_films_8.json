In 1940 , there was a hostile press campaign in Italy and other provocations , culminating in the sinking of the Greek light cruiser Elli by the Italians on 15 August ( the Christian Dormition of the Mother of God festival ) . On 28 October , Mussolini issued an ultimatum to Greece demanding the cession of Greek territory , which the Prime Minister of Greece , Ioannis Metaxas , rejected . The Italian army invaded Greece on 28 October , before the Italian ultimatum had expired . The invasion was a disaster , the 140,000 troops of the Italian Army in Albania encountering an entrenched and determined enemy . The Italians had to contend with the mountainous terrain on the Albanian-Greek border and unexpectedly tenacious resistance by the Greek Army .",
