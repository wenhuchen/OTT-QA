This was France 's fifth victory in the contest , following their wins in 1958 , 1960 , 1962 , and 1969 ( the latter being in the infamous four-way tie ) . The five wins were also a record at the time , and one that France held onto for seven years , until being equalled by Luxembourg in 1983 .

At the close of voting , it had received 69 points , coming seventh in a field of eighteen . The song is an up-tempo , disco-influenced number that deals with the group needing a million ( dollars ) and pleading with Mister President ( of a company ) for a job . They go on to describe the affluent lifestyle they hope to live with the money . It was succeeded as Belgian representative at the 1978 Contest by Jean Vall\u00e9e performing L'amour \u00e7a fait chanter la vie .

In addition , the two presenters served as commentators for France . Twenty countries participated , a record at the time . The winning entry was a love song sung in the Hebrew equivalent of Ubbi dubbi ( the title is an expansion of the Hebrew word ani \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 , meaning I ) . This was Israel 's first Eurovision win . The win caused problems for several North African and Middle-Eastern nations that were televising the contest , even though they were not participating . According to author and political commentator John Kennedy O'Connor in his book The Eurovision Song Contest : The Official History , when Israel became the clear winners during the voting , most of the Arabic stations ended their transmission of the contest . Jordanian TV finished the show with a photo of a bunch of daffodils on screen , later announcing that the Belgian entry ( which finished second ) was the winner .",

Therefore , this was Israel 's consecutive second win , and overall second win , in the contest . 19 countries participated , the 20 countries that took part at the previous 1978 Contest , except for Turkey which was also going to participate but eventually withdrew its entry for political reasons . Yugoslavia , who missed the 1978 Contest , also did n't want to take part nor transmit the 1979 show for political reasons .

  "/wiki/Hey_Nana": "Hey Nana was the Belgian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1979 , performed in Dutch by Micha Marah . Hey Nana was the source of some controversy between the artist and the Belgian TV channel BRT ( now ( VRT ) . Marah herself preferred another song from the Belgian pre-selections , Comment \u00e7a va , and consequently - and very unusually for an artist representing his or her country in the Contest - never made a studio recording of her Eurovision entry , not even for promotional purposes . The only commercially released version of Hey Nana was instead made by the composer , Charles Dumolin . The song was performed twelfth on the night ( following France 's Anne-Marie David with Je suis l'enfant soleil and preceding Luxembourg 's Jeane Manson with J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u00e7a dans tes yeux ) . At the close of voting , it had received 5 points , 2 from Denmark and the United Kingdom and 1 from Germany , finishing 18th ( shared last ) of 19 .

The band were moderately pleased with the outcome of the Contest , but for a somewhat unusual reason . At the time lead singer Michel Moers was quoted as saying : We had hoped to finish last , but Portugal decided otherwise . We got ten points from them and finished on the 19th [ sic ] spot . In hindsight their participation in the Contest however seems to have served its marketing purposes ; some thirty years on Euro-Vision still remains one of the band 's best-known songs , both in Belgium and internationally . The song was the first entry ever to mention the Contest by name as part of what is generally agreed to have been a send-up of the whole event ( previous entries such as Schmetterlinge 's Boom Boom Boomerang had parodied the Contest without actually naming it ) . Further , in contrast to the generally upbeat and lively entries submitted from other entrants , Telex performed from behind synthesisers and in a robotic - somewhat Kraftwerk-esque - manner . Telex released the song in French and English language versions and the band subsequently re-recorded the track for their first 'greatest hits ' compilation More than Distance , also released in 1980 , then retitled Neurovision . Furthermore , in 1993 Telex released their first CD box set , once again with a reference to their Eurovision participation back in 1980 ; the album was entitled Belgium.One Point .",

At the close of voting , it had received 13 points , placing 18th in a field of 20 .

Norway currently holds the record for the winning Eurovision entry with the shortest lyrics , in 1995 they won with Nocturne performed by Secret Garden , with a total of twenty-four words .
