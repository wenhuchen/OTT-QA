  "/wiki/USS_Constellation_(1854)": "USS Constellation is a sloop-of-war , the last sail-only warship designed and built by the United States Navy . She was built at the Gosport Shipyard between 1853 and 1855 and was named for the earlier frigate of the same name that had been broken up in 1853 . The sloop 's primary armament was 8-inch ( 203 mm ) shell-firing guns and four 32-pounder long guns , though she carried other guns as well , including two Parrott rifle chase guns . Constellation 's career as a front-line unit was relatively short ; after entering service in 1855 , she served with the Mediterranean Squadron until 1858 , and in 1859 , she was assigned as the flagship of the Africa Squadron , where she served with the African Slave Trade Patrol . During the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865 , the ship returned to the Mediterranean to patrol for Confederate vessels . In late 1864 , she returned to the United States to be decommissioned , as most of her crews ' enlistments had expired . She spent the rest of the war out of service . Constellation was recommissioned in 1871 for use as a training ship , being used for shooting practice and training cruises for midshipmen . She filled this role for twenty-two years , and during this period , she saw a number of other activities , including transporting exhibits for the 1878 Exposition Universelle in Paris and carrying food to Ireland during the 1879 Irish famine . She was reduced to a stationary training hulk in late 1893 , being moored in Newport for the next twenty years . During this period , the mistaken belief that the two Constellations were one and the same arose , and she was presented as such in 1914 during the centennial of the writing of The Star-Spangled Banner , the national anthem of the United States . Briefly renamed Old Constellation in 1917 to free the name for a new battlecruiser of the Lexington class , she reverted to her original name when the battlecruiser was scrapped in 1925 .",

A product of his 17-year Jesuit education in France , Carroll spoke five languages fluently . He was the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence and the longest lived .
