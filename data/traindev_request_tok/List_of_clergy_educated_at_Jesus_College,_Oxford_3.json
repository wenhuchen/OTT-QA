As a soldier , Xenophon became commander of the Ten Thousand at about 30 , with noted military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge saying of him , the centuries since have devised nothing to surpass the genius of this warrior . He established the precedent for many logistical operations and was among the first to use flanking maneuvers , feints and attacks in depth . He was among the greatest commanders of antiquity . As a historian , Xenophon is known for recording the history of his time , the late-5th and early-4th centuries BC , in such works as the Hellenica , which covered the final seven years and the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War ( 431-404 BC ) , thus representing a thematic continuation of Thucydides ' History of the Peloponnesian War . As one of the Ten Thousand ( Greek mercenaries ) , Xenophon participated in Cyrus the Younger 's failed campaign to claim the Persian throne from his brother Artaxerxes II of Persia . He recounted the events in Anabasis , his most notable history . Like Plato , Xenophon is an authority on Socrates , about whom he wrote several books of dialogues ( the Memorabilia ) and an Apology of Socrates to the Jury , which recounts the philosopher 's trial in 399 BC . Despite being born an Athenian citizen , Xenophon was also associated with Sparta , the traditional enemy of Athens . His pro-oligarchic politics , military service under Spartan generals in the Persian campaign and elsewhere , and his friendship with King Agesilaus II endeared Xenophon to the Spartans . Some of his works have a pro-Spartan bias , especially the royal biography Agesilaus and the Constitution of the Spartans . Xenophon 's works span several genres and are written in plain-language Attic Greek , for which reason they serve as translation exercises for contemporary students of the Ancient Greek language .",

The lengthiest and most famous of Xenophon 's Socratic writings , the Memorabilia is essentially an apologia ( defense ) of Socrates , differing from both Xenophon 's Apology of Socrates to the Jury and Plato 's Apology mainly in that the Apologies present Socrates as defending himself before the jury , whereas the former presents Xenophon 's own defense of Socrates , offering edifying examples of Socrates ' conversations and activities along with occasional commentary from Xenophon .",

The hymn tune is seven lines long , with a metrical index of 6.6.6.6.8.8.8 . It appears in a number of hymnals and is sung to a variety of words . The tune was used by Ralph Vaughan Williams as the basis of the second movement of his organ composition Three Preludes on Welsh Hymn Tunes .

The prelude has been arranged for other instruments or combinations of instruments , including solo piano , piano duet , clarinet choir and four recorders .
