  "/wiki/Railroad": "Rail transport or train transport is a means of transferring passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails , which are located on tracks . In contrast to road transport , where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface , rail vehicles ( rolling stock ) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run . Tracks usually consist of steel rails , installed on ties ( sleepers ) set in ballast , on which the rolling stock , usually fitted with metal wheels , moves . Other variations are also possible , such as slab track . This is where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface .",

  "/wiki/Dam": "A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of water or underground streams . Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation , human consumption , industrial use , aquaculture , and navigability . Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity . A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations . Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water , while other structures such as floodgates or levees ( also known as dikes ) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions . The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan , dating to 3,000 BC . The word dam can be traced back to Middle English , and before that , from Middle Dutch , as seen in the names of many old cities . The first known appearance of dam occurs in 1165 . However , there is one village , Obdam , that is already mentioned in 1120 . The word seems to be related to the Greek word taphos , meaning grave or grave hill . [ citation needed ] So the word should be understood as dike from dug out earth . The names of more than 40 places ( with minor changes ) from the Middle Dutch era ( 1150-1500 CE ) such as Amsterdam ( founded as 'Amstelredam ' in the late 12th century ) and Rotterdam , also bear testimony to the use of the word in Middle Dutch at that time .",

It formed early on October 29 along a cold front to the southeast of the Carolinas . As it moved up the East Coast , its associated snowfall broke records in at least 20 cities for total accumulations , resulting in a rare white Halloween two days later . The storm arrived just two months after Hurricane Irene caused extensive power outages and property damage in the Northeast ; with the 2011 New England tornado outbreak also causing damage in Western Massachusetts . It dumped snow on trees that were often still in leaf , adding extra weight , with the ground in some areas still soft from a preceding warm , rainy period that increased the possibility trees could be uprooted . Trees and branches that collapsed caused considerable damage , particularly to power lines , with estimates of storm costs ranging between $ 1 billion and $ 3 billion . In all , 3.2 million U.S. residences and businesses in 12 states experienced power outages , with the storm also impacting three Canadian provinces . Some customers in Connecticut did not get power back until early November ; many outages lasted 11 days Many communities chose to postpone celebrations of Halloween from two days to a week later as a result , or cancel them entirely .

The terms terrorist and terrorism originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but gained mainstream popularity in the 1970s during the conflicts of Northern Ireland , the Basque Country and Palestine . The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington , D.C. in 2001 . There are different definitions of terrorism . Terrorism is a charged term . It is often used with the connotation of something that is morally wrong . Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups . Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives . These include right-wing and left-wing political organizations , nationalist groups , religious groups , revolutionaries and ruling governments .

Manhattan serves as the city 's economic and administrative center , cultural identifier , and historical birthplace . The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island , bounded by the Hudson , East , and Harlem rivers ; as well as several small adjacent islands . Manhattan additionally contains Marble Hill , a small neighborhood now on the U.S. mainland , that was connected using landfill to the Bronx and separated from the rest of Manhattan by the Harlem River . Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components , each aligned with the borough 's long axis : Lower , Midtown , and Upper Manhattan .

  "/wiki/Tornado_outbreak": "A tornado outbreak is the occurrence of multiple tornadoes spawned by the same synoptic scale weather system . The number of tornadoes required to qualify as an outbreak typically are at least six to ten . The tornadoes usually occur within the same day , or continue into the early morning hours of the succeeding day , and within the same region . Most definitions allow for a break in tornado activity ( time elapsed from the end of last tornado to the beginning of next tornado ) of six hours . If tornado activity indeed resumes after such a lull , many definitions consider the event to be a new outbreak . A series of continuous or nearly continuous tornado outbreak days is a tornado outbreak sequence . Tornado outbreaks usually occur from March through June in the Great Plains of the United States and Canada , the Midwestern United States , and the Southeastern United States in an area colloquially referred to as Tornado Alley . Tornado outbreaks do occur during other times of the year and in other parts of the world , however . A secondary less active and annually inconsistent tornado season in the U.S. occurs in late autumn .

It is located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Western United States , with the Midwestern United States and Northeastern United States to its north and the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico to its south . The South does not fully match the geographic south of the United States but is commonly defined as including the states that fought for the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War . The Deep South is fully located in the southeastern corner . California , Arizona and New Mexico , which are geographically in the southern part of the country , are rarely considered part , while West Virginia , which separated from Virginia in 1863 , commonly is . Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries . While the states of Delaware and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia , permitted slavery prior to and during the Civil War , they remained with the Union . Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s , they became more culturally , economically , and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states , and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast by many residents , businesses , public institutions , and private organizations ; however , the United States Census Bureau continues to define them as in the South with regard to census regions . Usually , the South is defined as including the southeastern and south-central United States . The region is known for its culture and history , having developed its own customs , musical styles , and cuisines , which have distinguished it in some ways from the rest of the United States . The Southern ethnic heritage is diverse and includes strong European ( mostly English , Italian , Scottish , Scotch-Irish , Irish , German , French , Portuguese and Spanish American ) , African and some Native American components . Some other aspects of the historical and cultural development of the South have been influenced by the institution of slave labor on plantations in the Deep South to an extent seen nowhere else in the United States ; the presence of a large proportion of African Americans in the population ; support for the doctrine of states ' rights , and the legacy of racism magnified by the Civil War and Reconstruction Era , as seen in thousands of lynchings ( mostly from 1880 to 1930 ) , the segregated system of separate schools and public facilities known as Jim Crow laws , that lasted until the 1960s , and the widespread use of poll taxes and other methods to frequently deny black people of the right to vote or hold office until the 1960s .",

  "/wiki/Tornado": "A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or , in rare cases , the base of a cumulus cloud . The windstorm is often referred to as a twister , whirlwind or cyclone , although the word cyclone is used in meteorology to name a weather system with a low-pressure area in the center around which , from an observer looking down toward the surface of the earth , winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern . Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes , and they are often visible in the form of a condensation funnel originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud , with a cloud of rotating debris and dust beneath it . Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour ( 180 km/h ) , are about 250 feet ( 80 m ) across , and travel a few miles ( several kilometers ) before dissipating . The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour ( 480 km/h ) , are more than two miles ( 3 km ) in diameter , and stay on the ground for dozens of miles ( more than 100 km ) . Various types of tornadoes include the multiple vortex tornado , landspout , and waterspout . Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current , connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud . They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water , but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes . These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator and are less common at high latitudes . Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado , dust devil , fire whirl , and steam devil . Tornadoes occur most frequently in North America ( particularly in central and southeastern regions of the United States colloquially known as tornado alley ) , Southern Africa , northwestern and southeast Europe , western and southeastern Australia , New Zealand , Bangladesh and adjacent eastern India , and southeastern South America . Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data , such as hook echoes or debris balls , as well as through the efforts of storm spotters .",

Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition . Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen , O2 , to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy ( 418 kJ per 32 g of O2 ) ; the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here . At a certain point in the combustion reaction , called the ignition point , flames are produced . The flame is the visible portion of the fire . Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide , water vapor , oxygen and nitrogen . If hot enough , the gases may become ionized to produce plasma . Depending on the substances alight , and any impurities outside , the color of the flame and the fire 's intensity will be different . Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration , which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning . Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe . The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems . The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property , atmospheric pollution , and water contamination .",

Babbs was the scene of the nationally known Babbs Switch Fire on December 24 , 1924 , in which 36 people died in a school fire . Many of the dead were children but several families were completely wiped out . Although the Babbs school house is this community 's claim to fame , Babbs had as its largest feature a grain elevator that served the local farmers as a depository for small grains ( wheat , barley , oats , milo ) until the late 1970s when the elevator was closed due to its age and lack of repair by its owners , Hobart Farmer 's CO-OP . Additionally there was a gas station and a general store across Hwy 183 to the east approximately 2 city blocks from the elevator . The Babbs school house was rebuilt and utilized until World War II 's final days when the Babbs school district was consolidated into the Roosevelt and Hobart school districts .

  "/wiki/Zeppelin": "A Zeppelin is a type of rigid airship named after the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin ( German pronunciation : [ \u02c8t\u0361s\u025bp\u0259li\u02d0n ] ) who pioneered rigid airship development at the beginning of the 20th century . Zeppelin 's notions were first formulated in 1874 and developed in detail in 1893 . They were patented in Germany in 1895 and in the United States in 1899 . After the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design , the word zeppelin came to be commonly used to refer to all rigid airships . Zeppelins were first flown commercially in 1910 by Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG ( DELAG ) , the world 's first airline in revenue service . By mid-1914 , DELAG had carried over 10,000 fare-paying passengers on over 1,500 flights . During World War I , the German military made extensive use of Zeppelins as bombers and scouts , killing over 500 people in bombing raids in Britain . The defeat of Germany in 1918 temporarily slowed down the airship business . Although DELAG established a scheduled daily service between Berlin , Munich , and Friedrichshafen in 1919 , the airships built for this service eventually had to be surrendered under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , which also prohibited Germany from building large airships . An exception was made allowing the construction of one airship for the US Navy , which saved the company from extinction . In 1926 the restrictions on airship construction were lifted , and with the aid of donations from the public , work was started on the construction of LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin . This revived the company 's fortunes , and during the 1930s , the airships Graf Zeppelin and the larger LZ 129 Hindenburg operated regular transatlantic flights from Germany to North America and Brazil .",

The offensive was considered [ when ? ] a pre-eminent means of producing victory , although with the recognition of a defensive phase at some stage of the execution . A quick guide to the size or scope of the offensive is to consider the number of troops involved in the side initiating the offensive . Offensives are largely conducted as a means to secure initiative in a confrontation between opponents . They can be waged on land , at sea or in the air . Naval offensives , such as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , can have wide-ranging implications for national strategies and require a significant logistical commitment to destroy enemy naval capabilities . It can also be used to interdict enemy shipping , such as World War II 's Battle of the Atlantic . Naval offensives can also be tactical , such as Operation Coronado IX conducted by the United States Navy 's Mobile Riverine Force during the Vietnam War . An air offensive is an operation that can describe any number of different types of operations , usually restricted to specific types of aircraft .

  "/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea": "The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean , surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land : on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia , on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant . Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere .

  "/wiki/Tropical_cyclone": "A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center , a closed low-level atmospheric circulation , strong winds , and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain or squalls . Depending on its location and strength , a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names , including hurricane ( /\u02c8h\u028cr\u026ak\u0259n , -ke\u026an/ ) , typhoon ( /ta\u026a\u02c8fu\u02d0n/ ) , tropical storm , cyclonic storm , tropical depression , and simply cyclone . A hurricane is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean , and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean ; in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean , comparable storms are referred to simply as tropical cyclones or severe cyclonic storms . Tropical refers to the geographical origin of these systems , which form almost exclusively over tropical seas . Cyclone refers to their winds moving in a circle , whirling round their central clear eye , with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere . The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect . Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water . They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface , which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation . This energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms , such as nor'easters and European windstorms , which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts . Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km ( 62 and 1,243 mi ) in diameter . The strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth 's rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation . As a result , they rarely form within 5\u00b0 of the equator .",

  "/wiki/Semi-automatic_handgun": "A semi-automatic pistol is a type of pistol that is semi-automatic , meaning it uses the energy of the fired cartridge to cycle the action of the firearm and advance the next available cartridge into position for firing . One cartridge is fired each time the trigger of a semi-automatic pistol is pulled ; the pistol 's disconnector ensures this behavior . Additional terms sometimes used as synonyms for a semi-automatic pistol are automatic pistol , self-loading pistol , autopistol , and autoloading pistol . A semi-automatic pistol harnesses the energy of one shot to reload the chamber for the next . After a round is fired , the spent casing is ejected and a new round from the magazine is loaded into the chamber , allowing another shot to be fired as soon as the trigger is pulled again . Most pistols use recoil operation to do this , but some pistols use blowback or gas operation . Most types of semi-automatic pistols rely on a removable magazine to store ammunition before it is fired , usually inserted inside the grip .",
