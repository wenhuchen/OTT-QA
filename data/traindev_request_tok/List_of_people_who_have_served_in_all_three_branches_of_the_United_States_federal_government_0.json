Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

Duvall was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1811 to 1835 , during the Marshall Court and early-Taney Court eras . Previously , Duvall was the Comptroller of the Treasury , a Maryland state court judge , a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland , and a Maryland state legislator . Whether Duvall is deserving of the title of the most insignificant justice in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court has been the subject of much academic interest , most notably a debate between University of Chicago Law Professors David P. Currie and ( now-Judge ) Frank H. Easterbrook in 1983 . Currie argued that impartial examination of Duvall 's performance reveals to even the uninitiated observer that he achieved an enviable standard of insignificance against which all other justices must be measured . Easterbrook responded that Currie 's analysis lacked serious consideration of candidates so shrouded in obscurity that they escaped proper attention even in a contest of insignificance , and concluded that Duvall 's colleague , Justice Thomas Todd , was even more insignificant .",
