Prisoners lived in constant fear of brutal treatment and terror detention including standing cells , floggings , the so-called tree or pole hanging , and standing at attention for extremely long periods . There were 32,000 documented deaths at the camp , and thousands that are undocumented . Approximately 10,000 of the 30,000 prisoners were sick at the time of liberation .

It was finally closed in 1960 . There are several religious memorials within the Memorial Site , which is open to the public .",
