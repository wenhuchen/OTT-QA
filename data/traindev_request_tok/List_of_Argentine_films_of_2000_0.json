  "/wiki/Comedy": "In a modern sense , comedy ( from the Greek : \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 , k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda ) is a genre of fiction that refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter , especially in theatre , television , film , stand-up comedy , books and novels or any other medium of entertainment . The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece . In the Athenian democracy , the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters . The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict . Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a Society of Youth and a Society of the Old . A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes . In this struggle , the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority , and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter . Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt , thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor . Parody subverts popular genres and forms , critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them . Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy , which derives its humor largely from bizarre , surprising ( and improbable ) situations or characters , and black comedy , which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature . Similarly scatological humor , sexual humor , and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways . A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society ( usually upper-class society ) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members .",

  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",
