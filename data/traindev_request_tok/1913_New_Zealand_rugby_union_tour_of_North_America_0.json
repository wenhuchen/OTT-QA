The land was later turned into Vancouver 's first park when the city incorporated in 1886 . It was named after Lord Stanley , 16th Earl of Derby , a British politician who had recently been appointed Governor General . It was originally known as Coal Peninsula and was set aside for military fortifications to guard the entrance to Vancouver harbour . In 1886 Vancouver city council successfully sought a lease of the park which was granted for $ 1 per year . In September 1888 Lord Stanley opened the park in his name . :254 Unlike other large urban parks , Stanley Park is not the creation of a landscape architect , but rather the evolution of a forest and urban space over many years . Most of the manmade structures present in the park were built between 1911 and 1937 under the influence of then superintendent W.S . Rawlings ."
