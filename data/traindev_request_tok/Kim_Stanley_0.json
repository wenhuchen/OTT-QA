  "/wiki/Julie_Harris_(American_actress)": "Julia Ann Harris ( December 2 , 1925 - August 24 , 2013 ) was an American actress . Renowned for her classical and contemporary stage work , she received five Tony Awards for Best Actress in a Play . Debuting on Broadway in 1945 , much against the wishes of her mother , who wanted her to 'come out ' as a society debutante , Harris was acclaimed for a complex performance as an isolated 12-year-old girl in the 1950 play The Member of the Wedding , a role she reprised in the 1952 film of the same name , for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress . In 1951 , her range was demonstrated as Sally Bowles in the original production of I Am a Camera , for which she won her first Tony award . She subsequently appeared in the 1955 film version . After a lull in the quality of motion pictures she had parts in , the 1960s saw Harris give acclaimed performances in classic films , including The Haunting ( 1963 ) , and what is sometimes considered the screen role that allowed her to best display her talents , Reflections in a Golden Eye ( 1967 ) , in which she played opposite Marlon Brando . A rare method actor , she won Tony awards for The Lark ( 1956 ) , Forty Carats ( 1969 ) , The Last of Mrs. Lincoln ( 1973 ) , and The Belle of Amherst ( 1977 ) . She was also a Grammy Award winner and a three time Emmy Award winner .

  "/wiki/Lillian_Hellman": "Lillian Florence Hellman ( June 20 , 1905 - June 30 , 1984 ) was an American dramatist and screenwriter known for her success as a playwright on Broadway , as well as her Communist sympathies and political activism . She was blacklisted after her appearance before the House Committee on Un-American Activities ( HUAC ) at the height of the anti-communist campaigns of 1947-1952 . Although she continued to work on Broadway in the 1950s , her blacklisting by the American film industry caused a drop in her income . Many praised Hellman for refusing to answer questions by HUAC , but others believed , despite her denial , that she had belonged to the Communist Party . As a playwright , Hellman had many successes on Broadway , including Watch on the Rhine , The Autumn Garden , Toys in the Attic , Another Part of the Forest , The Children 's Hour and The Little Foxes . She adapted her semi-autobiographical play The Little Foxes into a screenplay , which starred Bette Davis and received an Academy Award nomination in 1942 . Hellman was romantically involved with fellow writer and political activist Dashiell Hammett , author of the classic detective novels The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man , who also was blacklisted for 10 years until his death in 1961 . The couple never married . Hellman 's accuracy was challenged after she brought a libel suit against Mary McCarthy . In 1979 , on The Dick Cavett Show , McCarthy said that every word she writes is a lie , including 'and ' and 'the ' . During the libel suit , investigators found errors in Hellman 's popular memoirs such as Pentimento . They said that the Julia section of Pentimento , which had been the basis for the Oscar-winning 1977 movie of the same name , was actually based on the life of Muriel Gardiner .",

  "/wiki/The_House_of_Bernarda_Alba": "The House of Bernarda Alba ( Spanish : La casa de Bernarda Alba ) is a play by the Spanish dramatist Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca . Commentators have often grouped it with Blood Wedding and Yerma as a rural trilogy . Lorca did not include it in his plan for a trilogy of the Spanish land ( which remained unfinished at the time of his murder ) . Lorca described the play in its subtitle as a drama of women in the villages of Spain . The House of Bernarda Alba was Lorca 's last play , completed on 19 June 1936 , two months before Lorca 's death during the Spanish Civil War . The play was first performed on 8 March 1945 at the Avenida Theatre in Buenos Aires . The play centers on the events of a house in Andalusia during a period of mourning , in which Bernarda Alba ( aged 60 ) wields total control over her five daughters Angustias ( 39 years old ) , Magdalena ( 30 ) , Amelia ( 27 ) , Martirio , ( 24 ) , and Adela ( 20 ) . The housekeeper ( La Poncia ) and Bernarda 's elderly mother ( Mar\u00eda Josefa ) also live there . The deliberate exclusion of any male character from the action helps build up the high level of sexual tension that is present throughout the play . Pepe el Romano , the love interest of Bernarda 's daughters and suitor of Angustias , never appears on stage . The play explores themes of repression , passion , and conformity , and inspects the effects of men upon women .",

O'Neill 's plays were among the first to include speeches in American English vernacular and involve characters on the fringes of society .

His career as a playwright produced four classics , and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics . Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg , Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre . Chekhov practiced as a medical doctor throughout most of his literary career : Medicine is my lawful wife , he once said , and literature is my mistress . Chekhov renounced the theatre after the reception of The Seagull in 1896 , but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by Konstantin Stanislavski 's Moscow Art Theatre , which subsequently also produced Chekhov 's Uncle Vanya and premiered his last two plays , Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard . These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble as well as to audiences , because in place of conventional action Chekhov offers a theatre of mood and a submerged life in the text . Chekhov had at first written stories to earn money , but as his artistic ambition grew , he made formal innovations which have influenced the evolution of the modern short story . He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers , insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions , not to answer them .",
