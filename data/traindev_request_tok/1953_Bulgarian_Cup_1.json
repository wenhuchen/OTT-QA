  "/wiki/Overtime_(sports)": "Overtime or extra time is an additional period of play specified under the rules of a sport to bring a game to a decision and avoid declaring the match a tie or draw where the scores are the same . In some sports , this extra period is played only if the game is required to have a clear winner , as in single-elimination tournaments where only one team or players can advance to the next round or win the tournament . In other sports , particularly those prominently played in North America where ties are generally disfavored , some form of overtime is employed for all games . The rules of overtime or extra time vary between sports and even different competitions . Some may employ sudden death , where the first player or team who scores immediately wins the game . In others , play continues until a specified time has elapsed , and only then is the winner declared . If the contest remains tied after the extra session , depending on the rules , the match may immediately end as a draw , additional periods may be played , or a different tiebreaking procedure such as a penalty shootout may be used instead . The terms overtime and in overtime ( abbreviated OT or IOT ) are primarily used in North America , whereas the terms extra time and after extra time ( abbreviated a.e.t . ) are usually used in other continents . However , in basketball , the terms overtime and in overtime are used worldwide .",
