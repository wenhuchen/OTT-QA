  "/wiki/Cyclone_Hyacinthe": "Tropical Cyclone Hyacinthe was the wettest tropical cyclone on record worldwide . The eighth named storm of the season , Hyacinthe formed on January 15 , 1980 , to the northeast of Mauritius in the southern Indian Ocean . Initially it moved to the west-southwest , and while slowly intensifying it passed north of the French overseas department of R\u00e9union . On January 19 , M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France estimated that the storm had intensified to a tropical cyclone . Hyacinthe looped to the south of eastern Madagascar and weakened , although it restrengthened after turning to the east . The storm executed another loop to the southwest of R\u00e9union , passing near the island for a second and later third time . Hyacinthe became extratropical on January 29 after turning southward , dissipating two days later . For twelve days , Hyacinthe dropped torrential rainfall on R\u00e9union ; nearly all of the island received more than 1 m ( 3.3 ft ) of precipitation . Over a 15 - day period from January 14 to January 28 , 6,083 mm ( 239.5 in ) of rainfall were recorded at Commerson 's Crater , a volcano . The heaviest rainfall occurred through a process called orographic lift in the mountainous interior , leading to hundreds of landslides . Widespread floods damaged half the roads on R\u00e9union and isolated three villages . Hyacinthe caused heavy damage to crops and damaged or destroyed 2,000 houses .",

  "/wiki/Storm_surge": "A storm surge , storm flood , tidal surge or storm tide is a coastal flood or tsunami-like phenomenon of rising water commonly associated with low pressure weather systems ( such as tropical cyclones and strong extratropical cyclones ) . Its severity is affected by the shallowness and orientation of the water body relative to storm path , as well as the timing of tides . Most casualties during tropical cyclones occur as the result of storm surges . It is a measure of the rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement related to tides . The two main meteorological factors contributing to a storm surge are a long fetch of winds spiraling inward toward the storm , and a low-pressure-induced dome of water drawn up under and trailing the storm 's center .",

Mahina struck Bathurst Bay , Cape York Peninsula , Queensland , on 4 March 1899 , and its winds and enormous storm surge combined to kill more than 300 people . While the Australian Bureau of Meteorology , which is the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center of the basin , estimates Mahina 's peak central pressure to be 914 hPa ( 26.99 inHg ) , the World Meteorological Organization is currently considering an application from Queensland scientists and researchers to have this value upgraded to 880 hPa ( 25.99 inHg ) , based on data from post-storm analysis . This would officially make Mahina the most intense cyclone recorded to have hit the Australian mainland , and the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere , a title currently held by Cyclone Winston . Cyclone Mahina also produced the largest storm surge on record , generating a 13-metre ( 43-foot ) -high surge .",

Luis was also the strongest hurricane to make landfall , and the third-most intense hurricane recorded during the extremely active season . It was the twelfth tropical storm , sixth hurricane , and second major hurricane of the season . At one point , the storm was one of four simultaneous tropical systems in the Atlantic basin , along with Humberto , Iris , and Karen . The storm lasted for 14 days as a tropical storm between late August and mid-September . Luis caused extensive damage in Antigua and St. Barthelemy and catastrophic damage in Barbuda , most area on St Martin and Anguilla as a Category 4 with winds between 130 mph ( 210 km/h ) and 135 mph ( 217 km/h ) . The storm accounted for 19 deaths , left over 60,000 disaster victims and near 10,000 homeless ( mostly in Anguilla , Barbuda and Saint Martin ) and caused roughly $ 3.3 billion ( 1995 USD ) in damage across the affected areas . At this time , Luis was the costliest and most devastating hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands and since the 1950 , it was the last Category 4 storms to hit the Leeward Islands in the 20th century after Hurricane Dog in 1950 , Hurricane Donna in 1960 , Hurricane David in 1979 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989 . Additionally , Luis was the second of three tropical cyclones to affect Guadeloupe in a short period of time , the first being Hurricane Iris a week before , and the last being Hurricane Marilyn only ten days afterward . During the next year , the Leeward Islands would be struck by Hurricane Bertha , while still repairing from Luis and Marilyn , then successively hit by Hortense , Erika , Georges , Jose , Lenny and Debby . The system formed from a tropical wave south of Cape Verde islands , west of Africa on August 27 , then subsequently attained tropical storm status on August 29 . Two days later , the storm reached hurricane status ; shortly thereafter , it rapidly strengthened into a 140 mph ( 220 km/h ) Category 4 hurricane .",

Since 18 April 2018 , she has been operating as a floating hotel in Dubai . QE2 was designed for the transatlantic service from her home port of Southampton , UK to New York , United States and was named after the earlier Cunard liner RMS Queen Elizabeth . She served as the flagship of the line from 1969 until succeeded by RMS Queen Mary 2 in 2004 . QE2 was designed in Cunard 's offices in Liverpool and Southampton and built in Clydebank , Scotland . She was considered the last of the transatlantic ocean liners until Queen Mary 2 entered service . QE2 was also the last oil-fired passenger steamship to cross the Atlantic in scheduled liner service until she was refitted with a modern diesel powerplant in 1986-87 . She undertook regular world cruises during almost 40 years of service , and later operated predominantly as a cruise ship , sailing out of Southampton , England .

  "/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina": "Hurricane Katrina was the most destructive tropical cyclone on record , tied with Hurricane Harvey in 2017 , causing $ 125 billion in damage , particularly in the city of New Orleans and the surrounding areas , and over 1,200 deaths . The storm was the third major hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season , and the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States , behind only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane , Hurricane Camille in 1969 , and Hurricane Michael in 2018 . Katrina originated on August 23 , 2005 as a tropical depression from the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten . Early the following day , the depression intensified into a tropical storm as it headed generally westward toward Florida , strengthening into a hurricane two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach on August 25 . After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida , Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and began to rapidly intensify . The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before weakening to Category 3 strength at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi . Over fifty breaches in surge protection levees surrounding the city of New Orleans , Louisiana caused of the majority of the death and destruction during Katrina . Eventually , 80% of the city , as well as large tracts of neighboring parishes , were inundated for weeks . The flooding also destroyed most of New Orleans ' transportation and communication facilities , leaving tens of thousands of people who had not evacuated the city prior to landfall stranded with little access to food , shelter or basic necessities . The scale of the disaster in New Orleans provoked massive national and international response efforts ; federal , local and private rescue operations evacuated displaced persons out of the city over the following weeks . Multiple investigations in the aftermath of the storm concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which had designed and built the region 's levees decades earlier , was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems , though federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928 .

It was the first major hurricane [ nb 2 ] to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 , ending a record 12-year span in which no hurricanes made landfall at the intensity of a major hurricane throughout the country . In a four-day period , many areas received more than 40 inches ( 1,000 mm ) of rain as the system slowly meandered over eastern Texas and adjacent waters , causing unprecedented flooding . With peak accumulations of 60.58 in ( 1,539 mm ) , in Nederland , Texas , Harvey was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States . The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes , which displaced more than 30,000 people and prompted more than 17,000 rescues . The eighth named storm , third hurricane , and first major hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles , reaching tropical storm status on August 17 . The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day , making landfall on the southern end of Barbados and a second landfall on Saint Vincent . Upon entering the Caribbean Sea , Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear , and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia , late on August 19 . The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west-northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula , before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August 23 . Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August 24 , regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day .

  "/wiki/Hurricane_Ioke": "Hurricane Ioke , also referred to as Typhoon Ioke , was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Central Pacific , as well as the fifth-most intense Pacific hurricane on record , tied with 1973 's Hurricane Ava . The first storm to form in the Central Pacific in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season , Ioke was a record breaking , long-lived and extremely powerful storm that traversed the Pacific for 17 days , reaching the equivalent of Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale on three different occasions . The cyclone developed in the Intertropical Convergence Zone on August 20 far to the south of Hawaii . Encountering warm waters , little wind shear , and well-defined outflow , Ioke intensified from a tropical depression to Category 4 status within 48 hours . Late on August 22 it rapidly weakened to Category 2 status before crossing over Johnston Atoll . Two days later favorable conditions again allowed for rapid strengthening , and Ioke attained Category 5 status on August 25 before crossing the International Date Line . As it continued westward its intensity fluctuated , and on August 31 it passed near Wake Island with winds of 155 mph ( 250 km/h ) . Ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward , and by September 6 it had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . The remnants of Ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into the Bering Sea , and then the Gulf of Alaska . Ioke did not affect any permanently-populated areas in the Central Pacific or Western Pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon . A crew of 12 people rode out the hurricane in a hurricane-proof bunker on Johnston Atoll ; the crew estimated winds reached over 100 mph ( 160 km/h ) , which damaged trees on the island but did not impact the island 's bird population . The typhoon left moderate damage on Wake Island totaling $ 88 million ( 2006 USD , equivalent to $ 110 million in 2018 ) , including blown off roofs and damaged buildings , though the infrastructure of the island was left intact ; all military personnel were evacuated from the island .",
  "/wiki/Pacific_Ocean": "The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth 's oceanic divisions . It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean ( or , depending on definition , to Antarctica ) in the south and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east . At 165,250,000 square kilometers ( 63,800,000 square miles ) in area ( as defined with an Antarctic southern border ) , this largest division of the World Ocean - and , in turn , the hydrosphere - covers about 46% of Earth 's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area , making it larger than all of Earth 's land area combined . The centers of both the Water Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere are in the Pacific Ocean . The equator subdivides it into the North ( ern ) Pacific Ocean and South ( ern ) Pacific Ocean , with two exceptions : the Gal\u00e1pagos and Gilbert Islands , while straddling the equator , are deemed wholly within the South Pacific . Its mean depth is 4,000 meters ( 13,000 feet ) . Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench , located in the western north Pacific , is the deepest point in the world , reaching a depth of 10,928 meters ( 35,853 feet ) . The Pacific also contains the deepest point in the Southern Hemisphere , the Horizon Deep in the Tonga Trench , at 10,823 meters ( 35,509 feet ) . The third deepest point on Earth , the Sirena Deep , is also located in the Mariana Trench . The western Pacific has many major marginal seas , including the South China Sea , the East China Sea , the Sea of Japan , the Sea of Okhotsk , the Philippine Sea , the Coral Sea , and the Tasman Sea .",
  "/wiki/1997_Pacific_typhoon_season": "The 1997 Pacific typhoon season was a record-breaking season featuring 11 tropical cyclones reaching super typhoon intensity , tying the record with 1965 with the most violent tropical cyclones globally . It has no official bounds ; it ran year-round in 1997 , but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean . The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the International Date Line . Storms that form east of the Date Line and north of the equator are called hurricanes ; see 1997 Pacific hurricane season . Tropical Storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center . Tropical depressions in this basin have the W suffix added to their number . Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA . This can often result in the same storm having two names .",
  "/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales": "Tropical cyclones are ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales , according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin ( s ) they are located in . Only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones , but some alternative scales also exist , such as accumulated cyclone energy , the Power Dissipation Index , the Integrated Kinetic Energy Index , and the Hurricane Severity Index . Tropical cyclones that develop in the Northern Hemisphere are unofficially classified by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales . Tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist within the North Atlantic Ocean or the North-eastern Pacific Ocean are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms . Should a system intensify further and become a hurricane , then it will be classified on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale , which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period . In the Western Pacific , the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin , which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period . The India Meteorological Department 's scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the North Indian Ocean , and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds . Tropical cyclones that develop in the Southern Hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on one of two scales , which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds : The Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale is used to classify systems within the Australian or South Pacific tropical cyclone basin . The scale used to classify systems in the South-West Indian Ocean is defined by Meteo France for use in various French territories , including New Caledonia and French Polynesia . The definition of sustained winds recommended by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute average at a height of 10 m ( 33 ft ) . However , the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period , at 10 m ( 33 ft ) above the surface . The scale used by RSMC New Delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period , and the Australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval .",
  "/wiki/Hurricane_Patricia": "Hurricane Patricia was the most intense tropical cyclone on record worldwide in terms of wind speed and the second-most intense on record worldwide in terms of pressure , behind Typhoon Tip in 1979 , with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 872 mbar ( hPa ; 25.75 inHg ) . Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec , south of Mexico , in mid-October 2015 , Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October 20 . Initial development was slow , with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification . The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia , the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season . Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October 22 . A well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in just 24 hours - a near-record pace . On October 23 , the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215 mph ( 345 km/h ) . [ nb 1 ] [ nb 2 ] This made it the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere and the strongest globally in terms of one-minute maximum sustained winds . Late on October 23 , dramatic weakening ensued and Patricia made landfall near Cuixmala , Jalisco , with winds of 150 mph ( 240 km/h ) . This made it the strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the Pacific coast of Mexico . Patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly , faster than it had intensified , as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Mexico . Within 24 hours of moving ashore , Patricia weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter , late on October 24 .",
  "/wiki/Cyclone_Winston": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston was the most intense tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere on record , as well as the strongest to make landfall in the Southern Hemisphere , with the possible exception of 1899 's Cyclone Mahina in both regards . Winston is also the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the South Pacific basin . The system was first noted as a tropical disturbance on 7 February 2016 , when it was located to the northwest of Port Vila , Vanuatu . Over the next few days , the system gradually developed as it moved southeast , acquiring gale-force winds by 11 February . The following day , it underwent rapid intensification and attained ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h ( 110 mph ) . Less favourable environmental conditions prompted weakening thereafter . After turning northeast on 14 February , Winston stalled to the north of Tonga on 17 February . Due to a change in higher level steering , the storm drifted back to the west . In the process , Winston again rapidly intensified , reaching Category 5 intensity on both the Australian tropical cyclone scale and the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale on 19 February . The storm passed directly over Vanua Balavu , where a national record wind gust of 306 km/h ( 190 mph ) was observed . The cyclone reached its peak intensity on 20 February , with ten-minute sustained winds of 280 km/h ( 175 mph ) and a pressure of 884 hPa ( mbar ; 26.10 inHg ) , shortly before making landfall on Viti Levu , Fiji . Thereafter , the storm slowly weakened within a less favourable environment ; the system turned southeast during this time , though remained well away from Fiji .",
  "/wiki/Typhoon_Tip": "Typhoon Tip , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Warling , was the largest and most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded . The forty-third tropical depression , nineteenth tropical storm , twelfth typhoon , and third super typhoon of the 1979 Pacific typhoon season , Tip developed out of a disturbance within the monsoon trough on October 4 near Pohnpei in Micronesia . Initially , a tropical storm to the northwest hindered the development and motion of Tip , though after the storm tracked farther north , Tip was able to intensify . After passing Guam , Tip rapidly intensified and reached peak sustained winds of 305 km/h ( 190 mph ) [ nb 1 ] and a worldwide record-low sea-level pressure of 870 hPa ( 25.69 inHg ) on October 12 . At its peak strength , Tip was the largest tropical cyclone on record , with a wind diameter of 2,220 km ( 1,380 mi ) . Tip slowly weakened as it continued west-northwestward and later turned to the northeast , in response to an approaching trough . The typhoon made landfall in southern Japan on October 19 , and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter . Tip 's extratropical remnants continued moving east-northeastward , until they dissipated near the Aleutian Islands on October 24 . U.S. Air Force aircraft flew 60 weather reconnaissance missions into the typhoon , making Tip one of the most closely observed tropical cyclones . Rainfall from Tip indirectly led to a fire that killed 13 Marines and injured 68 at Combined Arms Training Center , Camp Fuji in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan . Elsewhere in the country , the typhoon caused widespread flooding and 42 deaths ; offshore shipwrecks left 44 people killed or missing .",

  "/wiki/Typhoon_Haiyan": "Typhoon Haiyan , known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Yolanda , was one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded . On making landfall , Haiyan devastated portions of Southeast Asia , particularly the Philippines . It is the deadliest Philippine typhoon on record , killing at least 6,300 people in that country alone . In terms of JTWC-estimated 1-minute sustained winds , Haiyan is tied with Meranti for being the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone on record . In January 2014 , bodies were still being found . The thirtieth named storm , thirteenth typhoon , and fifth super typhoon of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season , Haiyan originated from an area of low pressure several hundred kilometers east-southeast of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia on November 2 , 2013 . Tracking generally westward , environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis and the system developed into a tropical depression on the following day . After becoming a tropical storm and being named Haiyan at 00:00 UTC on November 4 , the system began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to typhoon intensity by 18:00 UTC on November 5 . By November 6 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) assessed the system as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) ; the storm passed over the island of Kayangel in Palau shortly after attaining this strength . Thereafter , Haiyan continued to intensify ; at 12:00 UTC on November 7 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) upgraded the storm 's maximum ten-minute sustained winds to 230 km/h ( 145 mph ) , the highest in relation to the storm . The Hong Kong Observatory put the storm 's maximum ten-minute sustained winds at 285 km/h ( 180 mph ) prior to landfall in the central Philippines , while the China Meteorological Administration estimated the maximum two-minute sustained winds at the time to be around 78 m/s ( 280 km/h or 175 mph ) . At the same time , the JTWC estimated the system 's one-minute sustained winds at 315 km/h ( 195 mph ) , unofficially making Haiyan the strongest tropical cyclone ever observed based on wind speed , a record which would later be surpassed by Hurricane Patricia in 2015 at 345 km/h ( 215 mph ) .",

Impacting the Batanes in the Philippines , Taiwan , as well as Fujian Province in September 2016 , Meranti formed as a tropical depression on September 8 near the island of Guam . Tracking to the west northwest , Meranti gradually intensified until September 11 , at which point it began a period of rapid intensification . Continuing to rapidly intensify , it became a super typhoon early on September 12 , as it passed through the Luzon Strait , ultimately reaching its peak intensity on September 13 with 1-minute sustained winds of 315 km/h ( 195 mph ) . Shortly afterwards , it passed directly over the island of Itbayat . Meranti passed to the south of Taiwan as a super typhoon , and began weakening steadily as a result of land interaction . By September 15 , it struck Fujian Province as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon , becoming the strongest typhoon on record to impact the province . Upon moving inland , rapid weakening ensued and Meranti became extratropical the next day , dissipating shortly afterwards after it passed to the south of the Korean Peninsula . The island of Itbayat sustained a direct hit from the super typhoon near its peak intensity , severing communications from the island for several days . No fatalities were reported on the island from the island . The typhoon caused \u20b1244.99 million ( US $ 5.16 million ) in damage on the island .
