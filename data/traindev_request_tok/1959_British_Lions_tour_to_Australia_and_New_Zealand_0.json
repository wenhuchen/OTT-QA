  "/wiki/Wanganui": "Whanganui ( /\u02c8hw\u0252\u014b\u0259nu\u02d0i/ ; M\u0101ori : [ \u0278a\u014banui ] ) , also spelled Wanganui , is a city on the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand .

Whanganui is the ancestral home of Te \u0100ti Haunui-a-P\u0101p\u0101rangi and other Whanganui M\u0101ori tribes . The New Zealand Company began to settle the area in 1840 , establishing its second settlement after Wellington . In the early years most European settlers came via Wellington . Whanganui greatly expanded in the 1870s , and freezing works , woollen mills , phosphate works and wool stores were established in the town . Today , much of Whanganui 's economy relates directly to the fertile and prosperous farming hinterland . Like several New Zealand urban areas , it was officially designated a city until an administrative reorganisation in 1989 , and is now run by a District Council . Although the city was called Wanganui from 1854 , in February 2009 , the New Zealand Geographic Board recommended the spelling be changed to Whanganui . In December 2009 , the government decided that while either spelling was acceptable , Crown agencies would use the Whanganui spelling . On 17 November 2015 , Land Information New Zealand ( LINZ ) announced that Wanganui District would be renamed to Whanganui District .",
