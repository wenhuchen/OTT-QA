It was inaugurated in April 2005 and cost NOK 160 million to build . It is referred to as Aalesund Stadion by UEFA . It was the first top-level stadium in Norway to feature artificial turf , which was at the time a highly debated issue . When Aalesund opened the stadium , businessman Olav Nils Sunde donated a statue to the club , which was erected in front of the stadium . Whilst Sunde denied it , the statue bore a very strong resemblance to former Aalesund player John Arne Riise . In 2007 , when Riise played in the Champions League Final , a Norwegian commentator demanded the statue officially carry his name . Riise himself has said , [ The name change ] is not for me to decide . Everyone sees who it is , and I know that it was made for me . It was officially named John Arne Riise in April 2018 . Since 2009 it has also hosted the home games of the women 's Toppserien side Fortuna \u00c5lesund .

  "/wiki/Grass": "Poaceae ( /po\u028a\u02c8e\u026asia\u026a/ ) or Gramineae is a large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as grasses , commonly referred to collectively as grass . Poaceae includes the cereal grasses , bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and cultivated lawns and pasture . The Poaceae are the most important source of the world 's dietary energy supply . They provide , through direct human consumption , just over one-half ( 51% ) of all dietary energy ; rice provides 20% , wheat supplies 20% , maize ( corn ) 5.5% , and other grains 6% . Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks . The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem , forming a leaf-sheath . With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species , Poaceae are the fifth-largest plant family , following the Asteraceae , Orchidaceae , Fabaceae and Rubiaceae . Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant are estimated to constitute 40.5% of the land area of the Earth , excluding Greenland and Antarctica . Grasses are also an important part of the vegetation in many other habitats , including wetlands , forests and tundra . The Poaceae are the most economically important plant family , providing staple foods from domesticated cereal crops such as maize , wheat , rice , barley , and millet as well as feed for meat-producing animals . They are used as building materials ( bamboo , thatch , and straw ) . They are a source of biofuel , primarily via the conversion of maize to ethanol .",

  "/wiki/Artificial_turf": "Artificial turf is a surface of synthetic fibers made to look like natural grass . It is most often used in arenas for sports that were originally or are normally played on grass . However , it is now being used on residential lawns and commercial applications as well . The main reason is maintenance - artificial turf stands up to heavy use , such as in sports , and requires no irrigation or trimming . Domed , covered , and partially covered stadiums may require artificial turf because of the difficulty of getting grass enough sunlight to stay healthy . Artificial turf does have its downside , however : limited life , periodic cleaning requirements , petroleum use , toxic chemicals from infill , and heightened health and safety concerns . Artificial turf first gained substantial attention 54 years ago in 1966 , when it was installed in the year-old Astrodome . The specific product used was ChemGrass , developed by Monsanto and rebranded as AstroTurf ; this term since then became a generic trademark for any artificial turf throughout the late 20th century . AstroTurf remains a registered trademark but is no longer owned by Monsanto . The first generation turf systems ( i.e. , short-pile fibers without infill ) of the 1960s have been largely replaced by the second generation and third generation turf systems . Second generation synthetic turf systems feature longer fibers and sand infills , and third generation systems , which are most widely used today , offer infills that are mixtures of sand and granules of recycled rubber , or rubber crumb .",
