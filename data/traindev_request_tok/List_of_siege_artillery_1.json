  "/wiki/Caliber": "In guns , particularly firearms , caliber ( or calibre in British English ) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether or not the finished bore matches that specification . It is measured in inches to an accuracy of hundredths or thousandths of an inch or in millimeters . For example , a .45 caliber firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches ( 11 mm ) . Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions . For example , a 9 mm pistol has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters . Due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of imperial dimensions converted to metric units , metric designations are typically far out of specifications published in decimal inches . True caliber specifications require imperial measure , and even when cartridge designations ( often mistakenly referred to as caliber ) only specify caliber to even tenths or hundredths of an inch , actual barrel/chamber/projectile dimensions are published to at least thousandths of an inch and frequently tolerances extend into ten-thousandths of an inch . In a rifled barrel , the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves ; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States , while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world . Measurements across the grooves are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so-measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore leaving the lands behind . Good performance requires a concentric , straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within , in preference to a tight fit which can be achieved even with off-center , crooked bores that cause excessive friction , fouling and an out-of-balance , wobbling projectile in flight . While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for , they are still categorized together based on bore diameter . For example , a firearm might be described as a 30 caliber rifle , which could be any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly 0.30 inches ( 7.6 mm ) projectile ; or a 22 rimfire , referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a .22 caliber projectile .",

  "/wiki/German_Empire": "The German Empire ( German : Deutsches Kaiserreich , officially Deutsches Reich ) , sometimes referred to as Imperial Germany , was the German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 until the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1918 . It was founded on 1 January 1871 when the south German states , except for Austria , joined the North German Confederation and the new constitution came into force changing the name of the federal state to the German Empire and introduced the title of German Emperor for Wilhelm I , King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern . Berlin remained its capital , and Otto , Prince of Bismarck , Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor , the head of government . As these events occurred , the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War . The German Empire consisted of 26 states , most of them ruled by royal families . They included four kingdoms , six grand duchies , five duchies ( six before 1876 ) , seven principalities , three free Hanseatic cities , and one imperial territory . Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm , it contained about two thirds of Germany 's population and territory . Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally . After 1850 , the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized , with particular strengths in coal , iron ( and later steel ) , chemicals , and railways . In 1871 , Germany had a population of 41 million people ; by 1913 , this had increased to 68 million . A heavily rural collection of states in 1815 , the now united Germany became predominantly urban . During its 47 years of existence , the German Empire was an industrial , technological , and scientific giant , gaining more Nobel Prizes in science than any other country .",

  "/wiki/Russian_Empire": "The Russian Empire [ a ] was an empire that extended across Eurasia and North America from 1721 , following the end of the Great Northern War , until the Republic was proclaimed by the Provisional Government that took power after the February Revolution of 1917 . The third-largest empire in history , at its greatest extent stretching over three continents , Europe , Asia , and North America , the Russian Empire was surpassed in size only by the British and Mongol empires . The rise of the Russian Empire coincided with the decline of neighboring rival powers : the Swedish Empire , the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , Persia and the Ottoman Empire . It played a major role in 1812-1814 in defeating Napoleon 's ambitions to control Europe and expanded to the west and south . The House of Romanov ruled the Russian Empire from 1721 until 1762 . Its matrilineal branch of patrilineal German descent , the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov , ruled from 1762 to the end of the empire . At the beginning of the 19th century , the Russian Empire extended from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea in the south , from the Baltic Sea on the west into Alaska and Northern California in America on the east . With 125.6 million subjects registered by the 1897 census , it had the third-largest population in the world at the time , after Qing China and India . Like all empires , it featured great diversity in terms of economies , ethnicities , languages , and religion . There were many dissident elements that launched numerous rebellions and assassinations over the centuries . In the 19th century , they were closely watched by the imperial secret police , and thousands were exiled to Siberia . Economically , the empire was predominantly agricultural , with low productivity on large estates worked by Russian peasants , known as serfs , who were tied to the land in a feudal arrangement .",

The major theatres of operations were the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden in Southern Manchuria and the seas around Korea , Japan and the Yellow Sea . Russia sought a warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean for its navy and for maritime trade . Vladivostok was operational only during the summer , whereas Port Arthur , a naval base in Liaodong Province leased to Russia by China , was operational all year . Since the end of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 , Japan feared Russian encroachment on its plans to create a sphere of influence in Korea and Manchuria . Russia had demonstrated an expansionist policy in the Siberian Far East from the reign of Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century . Seeing Russia as a rival , Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance in Manchuria in exchange for recognition of Korea as being within the Japanese sphere of influence . Russia refused and demanded Korea north of the 39th parallel to be a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan . The Japanese government perceived a Russian threat to their plans for expansion into Asia and chose to go to war . After negotiations broke down in 1904 , the Japanese Navy opened hostilities by attacking the Russian Eastern Fleet at Port Arthur , China , in a surprise attack . Russia suffered multiple defeats by Japan , but Tsar Nicholas II was convinced that Russia would win and chose to remain engaged in the war ; at first , to await the outcomes of certain naval battles , and later to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a humiliating peace . Russia ignored Japan 's willingness early on to agree to an armistice and rejected the idea to bring the dispute to the Arbitration Court at The Hague .",

  "/wiki/Austria-Hungary": "Austria-Hungary , often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Dual Monarchy , was a constitutional monarchy in Central and Eastern Europe between 1867 and 1918 . It was formed when the Austrian Empire adopted a new constitution ; as a result Austria ( Cisleithania ) and Hungary ( Transleithania ) were placed on equal footing . It dissolved when its member states proclaimed sovereignty and independence following the First World War . The union was established by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 on 30 March 1867 in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War . It consisted of two monarchies ( Austria and Hungary ) , and one autonomous region : the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown , which negotiated the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement in 1868 . It was ruled by the House of Habsburg , and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy . Following the 1867 reforms , the Austrian and Hungarian states were co-equal in power . Foreign and military affairs came under joint oversight , but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states . Austria-Hungary was a multinational state and one of Europe 's major powers at the time . Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire , at 621,538 km2 ( 239,977 sq mi ) , and the third-most populous ( after Russia and the German Empire ) . The Empire built up the fourth-largest machine building industry of the world , after the United States , Germany , and the United Kingdom .

  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively .

  "/wiki/18_cm_kurze_Kanone_M_80": "The 18 cm kurze Kanone M 80 ( short cannon ) was a heavy siege howitzer used by Austria-Hungary during World War I . Designed to replace the M 61 series of siege guns the M 80 family of siege guns offered greater range and armor penetration than the older guns . The proven steel-bronze was used for the barrel and the iron carriage lacked any system to absorb recoil other than the traditional recoil wedges placed underneath and behind the wheels of the carriage . These wedges helped to absorb the recoil force and encouraged the wheels to run forward to bring the gun back into battery . Generally a wooden firing platform was constructed for these guns in action to provide a level and smooth surface . For transport the barrel was removed from the carriage by a crane and carried separately . These siege guns were no longer useful against modern armored fortresses by the outbreak of World War I and many saw action in the field to fill the need for heavy howitzers ."
