  "/wiki/Sakharov_Prize": "The Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought , commonly known as the Sakharov Prize , honours individuals and groups of people who have dedicated their lives to the defense of human rights and freedom of thought . Named after Russian scientist and dissident Andrei Sakharov , the prize was established in December 1988 by the European Parliament . A shortlist of nominees is drawn up annually by the European Parliament 's Committee on Foreign Affairs and Committee on Development . The MEPs who make up those committees then select a shortlist in September . Thereafter , the final choice is given to The European Parliaments Conference of Presidents ( President and political groups leaders ) and the laureate 's name is announced late in October . The prize is awarded in a ceremony at the Parliaments Strasbourg hemicycle ( round chamber ) in December . The prize includes a monetary award of \u20ac50,000 . The first prize was awarded jointly to South African Nelson Mandela and Russian Anatoly Marchenko . The 1990 award was given to Aung San Suu Kyi , but she could not receive it until 2013 as a result of her political imprisonment in Burma . The prize has also been awarded to organisations , the first being the Argentine Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo in 1992 . Five Sakharov laureates were subsequently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize : Nelson Mandela , Aung San Suu Kyi , Malala Yousafzai , Denis Mukwege , and Nadia Murad . Razan Zaitouneh ( 2011 ) was kidnapped in 2013 and is still missing .",

Announced in 1912 by Jacques Schneider , a French financier , balloonist and aircraft enthusiast , the competition offered a prize of approximately \u00a31,000 . The race was held twelve times between 1913 and 1931 . It was intended to encourage technical advances in civil aviation but became a contest for pure speed with laps over a ( usually ) triangular course ( initially 280 km , later 350 km ) . The contests were staged as time trials , with aircraft setting off individually at pre-agreed times , usually 15 minutes apart . The contests were very popular and some attracted crowds of over 200,000 spectators . An earlier trophy , also presented by Jacques Schneider in 1910 , in France , was the Schneider Cup , which is now in the possession of the RAF College Cranwell . If an aero club won three races in five years , they would retain the trophy and the winning pilot would receive 75,000 francs for each of the first three wins . Each race was hosted by the previous winning country . The races were supervised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale and the aero club in the hosting country .
