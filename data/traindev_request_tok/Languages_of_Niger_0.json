The total number of Hausa speakers is estimated at 63 million , according to Ethnologue . The ancestral language of the Hausa people , one of the largest ethnic groups in Central Africa , Hausa is mostly spoken throughout southern Niger and northern Nigeria . It has developed into a lingua franca across much of Western Africa for purposes of trade . A small group in the US speak Hausa ( mostly from Ghana ) .",
  "/wiki/Afro-Asiatic": "Afroasiatic ( Afro-Asiatic ) , also known as Afrasian and in older sources as Hamito-Semitic ( Chamito-Semitic ) or Semito-Hamitic , is a large language family of about 300 languages that are spoken predominantly in West Asia , North Africa , the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel . Afroasiatic languages have over 495 million native speakers , the fourth largest number of any language family ( after Indo-European , Sino-Tibetan and Niger-Congo ) . The phylum has six branches : Berber , Chadic , Cushitic , Egyptian , Omotic and Semitic . By far the most widely spoken Afroasiatic language or dialect continuum is Arabic . A de facto group of distinct language varieties within the Semitic branch , the languages that evolved from Proto-Arabic have around 313 million native speakers , concentrated primarily in West Asia and North Africa . In addition to languages spoken today , Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages , such as Ancient Egyptian , which forms a distinct branch of the family , and Akkadian , Biblical Hebrew and Old Aramaic , all of which are from the Semitic branch . The original homeland of the Afroasiatic family , and when the parent language ( i.e . Proto-Afroasiatic ) was spoken , are yet to be agreed upon by historical linguists . Proposed locations include North Africa , the Horn of Africa , the Eastern Sahara and the Levant .",

  "/wiki/Songhay_languages": "The Songhay or Songhai languages ( [ so\u014baj ] or [ so\u014boj ] ) are a group of closely related languages/dialects centred on the middle stretches of the Niger River in the West African countries of Mali , Niger , Benin , Burkina Faso and Nigeria . In particular , they are spoken in the cities of Timbuktu and Gao . They have been widely used as a lingua franca in that region ever since the era of the Songhai Empire . In Mali , the government has officially adopted the dialect of Gao ( east of Timbuktu ) as the dialect to be used as a medium of primary education . Some Songhay languages have little to no mutual intelligibility between each other . For example , Koyraboro Senni , spoken in Gao , is unintelligible to speakers of Zarma in Niger , according to Ethnologue . However , Songhay , Zarma , and Dendi have high mutual intelligibility within Niger . For linguists , a major point of interest in the Songhay languages has been the difficulty of determining their genetic affiliation ; they are commonly taken to be Nilo-Saharan , as defined by Greenberg in 1963 , but this classification remains controversial . Linguist Gerrit Dimmendaal ( 2008 ) believes that for now it is best considered an independent language family . Roger Blench argues that the Songhay and Saharan languages form a Songhay-Saharan branch with each other within the wider Nilo-Saharan linguistic phylum . Historically , the name Songhay was neither an ethnic nor a linguistic designation , but a name for the ruling caste of the Songhai Empire . Under the influence of French language usage , speakers in Mali have increasingly been adopting it as an ethnic self-designation ; however , other Songhay-speaking groups identify themselves with other ethnic terms , such as Zarma ( Djerma ) or Isawaghen .",
  "/wiki/Zarma_language": "Zarma ( also spelled Djerma , Dyabarma , Dyarma , Dyerma , Adzerma , Zabarma , Zarbarma , Zarma , Zarmaci or Zerma ) is one of the Songhay languages . It is the leading indigenous language of the southwestern lobe of the West African nation of Niger , where the Niger River flows and the capital city , Niamey , is located . Zarma is the second-most common language in the country , after Hausa , which is spoken in south-central Niger . With over 2 million speakers , Zarma is easily the most widely spoken Songhay language . In earlier decades , Zarma was known as Djerma , and it is still sometimes called Zerma , especially among French-speakers , but it is usually now called Zarma , the name that its speakers use in their own language .",

They comprise a group of closely related languages spoken by the Berbers , who are indigenous to North Africa . The languages were traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script , which now exists in the form of Tifinagh . Berber is spoken by large populations of Morocco , Algeria and Libya , by smaller populations of Tunisia , northern Mali , western and northern Niger , northern Burkina Faso and Mauritania and in the Siwa Oasis of Egypt . Large Berber-speaking migrant communities , today numbering about 4 million , have been living in Western Europe , spanning over three generations , since the 1950s . The number of Berber people is much higher than the number of Berber speakers . Around 90% of the Berber-speaking population speak one of seven major varieties of Berber , each with at least 2 million speakers . They are , in order of number of speakers : Shilha ( Tacel\u1e25iyt ) , Kabyle ( Taqbaylit ) , Central Atlas Tamazight ( Tamazi\u0263t ) , Riffian ( internal : Tmazi\u0263t , external : Tarifiyt ) , Shawiya ( Tacawit ) and Tuareg ( Tamaceq/Tamajeq/Tamaheq ) . The now extinct Guanche language spoken on the Canary Islands by the Guanches , as well as possibly the languages of the ancient C-Group culture in today 's southern Egypt and northern Sudan , are believed to have belonged to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family . The Berber languages and dialects have had a written tradition , on and off , for about 2,500 years , although the tradition has been frequently disrupted by cultural shifts and invasions . They were first written in the Libyco-Berber abjad , which is still used today by the Tuareg in the form of Tifinagh . The oldest dated inscription is from 3rd century BCE .",

Along with other related languages such as Serer and Wolof , it belongs to the Senegambian branch within the Niger-Congo languages , which does not have tones , unlike most other Niger-Congo languages . More broadly , it belongs to the Atlantic geographic grouping within Niger-Congo .

  "/wiki/Niger\u2013Congo": "The Niger-Congo languages are the world 's third largest language family in terms of number of speakers and Africa 's largest in terms of geographical area , number of speakers and number of distinct languages . It is generally considered to be the world 's largest language family in terms of distinct languages , ahead of Austronesian , although this is complicated by the ambiguity about what constitutes a distinct language ; the number of named Niger-Congo languages listed by Ethnologue is 1,540 . It is the third-largest language family in the world by number of native speakers , comprising around 700 million people as of 2015 . Within Niger-Congo , the Bantu languages alone account for 350 million people ( 2015 ) , or half the total Niger-Congo speaking population . The most widely spoken Niger-Congo languages by number of native speakers are Yoruba , Igbo , Fula and Zulu . The most widely spoken by total number of speakers is Swahili . While the ultimate genetic unity of the core of Niger-Congo ( called Atlantic-Congo ) is widely accepted , the internal cladistic structure is not well established . Other primary branches may include Dogon , Mande , Ijo , Katla and Rashad . The connection of the Mande languages especially has never been demonstrated , and without them the validity of Niger-Congo family as a whole ( as opposed to Atlantic-Congo or a similar subfamily ) has not been established . One of the most distinctive characteristics common to Atlantic-Congo languages is the use of a noun-class system , which is essentially a gender system with multiple genders .",
  "/wiki/Atlantic_languages": "The Atlantic languages ( or West Atlantic languages [ note 1 ] ) of West Africa are a major subgroup of the Niger-Congo languages . The exact scope of the Atlantic subgroup is the object of current research . The Atlantic languages are spoken along the Atlantic coast from Senegal to Sierra Leone , though transhumant Fula speakers have spread eastward and are found in large numbers across the Sahel , from Senegal to Nigeria , Cameroon and Sudan . Wolof of Senegal and several of the Fula languages are the most populous Atlantic languages , with several million speakers each . Other significant members include Serer and the Jola dialect cluster of Senegal . Temne , a major language of Sierra Leone , was included in the Atlantic subgroup in earlier classifications , but in modern proposals , it is no longer grouped within Atlantic . Most Atlantic languages exhibit consonant mutation and have noun-class systems similar to those of the distantly related Bantu languages . Some languages are tonal , while others such as Wolof have pitch-accent systems . The basic word order tends to be SVO .",

  "/wiki/Nilo-Saharan": "The Nilo-Saharan languages are a proposed family of African languages spoken by some 50-60 million people , mainly in the upper parts of the Chari and Nile rivers , including historic Nubia , north of where the two tributaries of the Nile meet . The languages extend through 17 nations in the northern half of Africa : from Algeria to Benin in the west ; from Libya to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the centre ; and from Egypt to Tanzania in the east . As indicated by its hyphenated name , Nilo-Saharan is a family of the African interior , including the greater Nile Basin and the Central Sahara Desert . Eight of its proposed constituent divisions ( excluding Kunama , Kuliak , and Songhay ) are found in the modern two nations of Sudan and South Sudan , through which the Nile River flows . In his book The Languages of Africa ( 1963 ) , Joseph Greenberg named the group and argued it was a genetic family . It contains the languages which are not included in the Niger-Congo , Afroasiatic or Khoisan groups . Although some linguists have seen the phylum as Greenberg 's wastebasket , into which he placed all the otherwise unaffiliated non-click languages of Africa , specialists in the field have accepted its reality since Greenberg 's classification . Its supporters accept that it is a challenging proposal to demonstrate but contend that it looks more promising the more work is done . Some of the constituent groups of Nilo-Saharan are estimated to predate the African neolithic . Thus , the unity of Eastern Sudanic is estimated to date to at least the 5th millennium BC . Nilo-Saharan genetic unity would necessarily be much older still and date to the late Upper Paleolithic . This larger classification system is not accepted by all linguists , however .",

It is now the lingua franca of the Arab world . It is named after the Arabs , a term initially used to describe peoples living in the area bounded by Mesopotamia in the east and the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west , in Northwestern Arabia and in the Sinai Peninsula . The ISO assigns language codes to thirty varieties of Arabic , including its standard form , Modern Standard Arabic , also referred to as Literary Arabic , which is modernized Classical Arabic . This distinction exists primarily among Western linguists ; Arabic speakers themselves generally do not distinguish between Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic , but rather refer to both as al-\u02bfarabiyyatu l-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 ( \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670 , the purest Arabic ) or simply al-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 ( \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670 ) . Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces , government and the media . Arabic , in its standard form , is the official language of 26 states , as well as the liturgical language of the religion of Islam , since the Quran and Hadith were written in Arabic . During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus . Sicilian has about 500 Arabic words , many of which relate to agriculture and related activities , [ full citation needed ] as a legacy of the Emirate of Sicily from the mid-9th to mid-10th centuries , while Maltese language is a Semitic language developed from a dialect of Arabic and written in the Latin alphabet . The Balkan languages , including Greek and Bulgarian , have also acquired a significant number of Arabic words through contact with Ottoman Turkish .",
  "/wiki/Semitic_languages": "The Semitic languages , previously also named Syro-Arabian languages , are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family originating in the Middle East that are spoken by more than 330 million people across much of Western Asia , North Africa and the Horn of Africa , as well as in often large immigrant and expatriate communities in North America , Europe and Australasia . The terminology was first used in the 1780s by members of the G\u00f6ttingen School of History , who derived the name from Shem , one of the three sons of Noah in the Book of Genesis . The most widely spoken Semitic languages today are ( numbers given are for native speakers only ) Arabic ( 300 million ) , Amharic ( ~65 million ) , Tigrinya ( 7 million ) , Hebrew ( ~5 million native/L1 speakers ) , Tigre ( ~1.05 million ) , Aramaic ( 575,000 to 1 million largely Assyrian fluent speakers ) and Maltese ( 483,000 speakers ) . Semitic languages occur in written form from a very early historical date , with East Semitic Akkadian and Eblaite texts ( written in a script adapted from Sumerian cuneiform ) appearing from the 30th century BCE and the 25th century BCE in Mesopotamia and the northern Levant respectively . The only earlier attested languages are Sumerian , Elamite ( 2800 BCE to 550 BCE ) ( both language isolates ) , Egyptian and unclassified Lullubi from the 30th century BCE . Most scripts used to write Semitic languages are abjads - a type of alphabetic script that omits some or all of the vowels , which is feasible for these languages because the consonants in the Semitic languages are the primary carriers of meaning . Among them are the Ugaritic , Phoenician , Aramaic , Hebrew , Syriac , Arabic , and South Arabian alphabets . The Ge'ez script , used for writing the Semitic languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea , is technically an abugida - a modified abjad in which vowels are notated using diacritic marks added to the consonants at all times , in contrast with other Semitic languages which indicate diacritics based on need or for introductory purposes . Maltese is the only Semitic language written in the Latin script and the only Semitic language to be an official language of the European Union . The Semitic languages are notable for their nonconcatenative morphology . That is , word roots are not themselves syllables or words , but instead are isolated sets of consonants ( usually three , making a so-called triliteral root ) . Words are composed out of roots not so much by adding prefixes or suffixes , but rather by filling in the vowels between the root consonants ( although prefixes and suffixes are often added as well ) .",

It is the major language of the easternmost parts of Burkina Faso , around the traditional Gurma capital Fada N'Gourma ; its range extends a little into northern Togo and Benin , and into the neighbouring part of Niger . Like all its close relations and neighbours , Gourmanch\u00e9 is a tone language ; it distinguishes high , mid , and low tones . In the standard orthography the symbols c j represent palatal stops ; they sound somewhat similar to English ch and j respectively . Gourmanch\u00e9 preserves most of the noun-class based grammatical gender system characteristic of the Niger-Congo family , with eight classes and regular agreement of pronouns , adjectives and numerals . As with other Gur languages , the noun classes are marked by suffixes ( not prefixes , as in Bantu ) ; the suffixes come in singular/plural pairs for count nouns , e.g . tibu tree , tiidi trees and are unpaired for mass nouns , e.g . \u00f1ima water , soama blood , gulimancema Gourmanch\u00e9 language . Gourmanch\u00e9 has sometimes been said to have noun prefixes as well as suffixes , agreeing in class . However , these prefixes are in fact proclitic particles with an article-like function . They are written as separate words in the standard orthography : bu tibu a/the tree , i tiidi ( the ) trees , mi \u00f1ima ( the ) water , and they are omitted , for example , when the noun is preceded by a possessor or followed by kuli each ; thus u nuu , hand , ki biga child , o joa man but e.g o joa muubi o biga nuu the man holds his child 's hand ; o nilo a person but nilo kuli each person .",
