  "/wiki/Boomerang:_Coast_to_Coaster": "Boomerang : Coast to Coaster is a steel roller coaster of shuttle design currently in use at four different Six Flags & EPR theme parks . The ride was designed and manufactured by Vekoma , and is considered as one of its boomerang models . Each coaster has one train with a capacity of 28 , two across in each row . Unlike Vekoma 's suspended trains , Boomerang : Coast to Coaster operates a sit-down design . When the coaster starts , the train is pulled backwards up the lift hill , then dropped through the loading gate through a cobra roll and then one loop . At the end of this cycle the train is pulled up the lift hill at the end of the track , then dropped once again allowing the train to go back through the loops backwards , hence the name Boomerang : Coast to Coaster .",
