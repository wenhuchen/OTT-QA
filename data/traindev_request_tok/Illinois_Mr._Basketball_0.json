It is the original campus of Proviso Township High Schools District 209 . Prior to being split into East and Proviso West High School in 1958 , East was known as Proviso Township High School . The school is located at the intersection of Madison Street and First Avenue ( which is Illinois Route 171 in that part of Maywood ) . Proviso East 's history in many ways reflects that of some suburban and urban schools in the United States . While initially serving mostly a Caucasian population , as demographic shifts occurred in the post-World War II years , a larger African-American population moved in creating tensions that were widespread in similar communities across the United States . Despite the tensions that occurred in the second half of the twentieth century , the school is known for its extensive list of notable alumni . While perhaps best known for its connection to notable NBA players ( Jim Brewer and Glenn Doc Rivers among the more prominent ) and other athletes such as Ray Nitschke , the school has seen other alumni achieve well in other areas , such as businesswomen Sheila Johnson , actor Dennis Franz , and astronaut Eugene Cernan , the last human to walk on the moon . The current principal is Dr. Patrick J. Hardy .",
