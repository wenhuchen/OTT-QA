  "/wiki/Looney_Tunes_Golden_Collection:_Volume_6": "Looney Tunes Golden Collection : Volume 6 is a four-disc DVD box set collection of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons . Following the pattern of one release each year of the previous volumes , it was released on October 21 , 2008 . Warner Home Video had announced that this will be the final release in the Golden Collection series . Succeeding the Golden Collection series would be the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection series on Blu-ray , which had its first release in November 2011 . On July 3 , 2012 , a two-disc DVD version of Volume 1 of the Platinum Collection was released . Volume 6 is far less child-friendly than the other five volumes in the series . Like Volumes 3 , 4 , and 5 , it has a warning before each disc about the shorts containing content that some viewers would not consider to be politically correct by today 's standards ( but will be shown uncut and uncensored for historical reasons ) , and as such , is intended for the adult collector . However , Volume 6 's disclaimer states that it is not suitable for children , as opposed to Volumes 3-5 stating that they may not be suitable for children . This is due to that in addition to containing cartoons that have racial and/or ethnic stereotypes ( like in Volumes 3 , 4 , and 5 ) and references to sexism in Robert McKimson 's Wild Wife , Volume 6 also contains many cartoons that pertain to World War II , most of them containing depictions or references to Adolf Hitler and Hideki Tojo or to Nazis and Imperial Japan in general . While Volumes 4 and 5 each had a couple explicitly WWII themed cartoons ( Plane Daffy and Scrap Happy Daffy , respectively ) , Volume 6 is notable for having an entire disc dedicated to the subject ( Disc 2 : Patriotic Pals ) , including several of its bonus cartoons . Volume 6 was originally only released in North America due to the poor sales of Volume 5 . However , the discs in this volume were not region-coded , making it easy for collectors outside of North America to import and play this set .",
