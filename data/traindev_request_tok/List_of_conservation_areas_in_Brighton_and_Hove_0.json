  "/wiki/Manor_house": "A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor . The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system ; within its great hall were held the lord 's manorial courts , communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets . The term is today loosely applied to various country houses , frequently dating from the late medieval era , which formerly housed the gentry . They were sometimes fortified , but this was frequently intended more for show than for defence . Manor houses existed in most European countries where feudalism existed , where they were sometimes known as castles , palaces , and so on .",

Its distinctive yellow colour and soft appearance come from the yellow local clay from which the bricks were made . London Stocks are still made in comparatively small quantities in traditional brickworks , mainly in Kent and Sussex , for heritage work , and machine-made versions are available for use where a cheaper approximation to the traditional product is acceptable . Red stock bricks are also fairly common , but only the yellow or brown coloured bricks are usually known as London stocks .",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
  "/wiki/Classical_order": "An order in architecture is a certain assemblage of parts subject to uniform established proportions , regulated by the office that each part has to perform . Coming down to the present from Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman civilization , the architectural orders are the styles of classical architecture , each distinguished by its proportions and characteristic profiles and details , and most readily recognizable by the type of column employed . The three orders of architecture - the Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian - originated in Greece . To these the Romans added , in practice if not in name , the Tuscan , which they made simpler than Doric , and the Composite , which was more ornamental than the Corinthian . The architectural order of a classical building is akin to the mode or key of classical music ; the grammar or rhetoric of a written composition . It is established by certain modules like the intervals of music , and it raises certain expectations in an audience attuned to its language . Whereas the orders were essentially structural in Ancient Greek architecture , which made little use of the arch until its late period , in Roman architecture where the arch was often dominant , the orders became increasingly decorative elements except in porticos and similar uses . Columns shrank into half-columns emerging from walls or turned into pilasters . This treatment continued after the conscious and correct use of the orders , initially following exclusively Roman models , returned in the Italian Renaissance . Greek Revival architecture , inspired by increasing knowledge of Greek originals , returned to more authentic models , including ones from relatively early periods .",
  "/wiki/Pilaster": "In classical architecture , a pilaster is an architectural element used to give the appearance of a supporting column and to articulate an extent of wall , with only an ornamental function . It consists of a flat surface raised from the main wall surface , usually treated as though it were a column , with a capital at the top , plinth ( base ) at the bottom , and the various other column elements . In contrast to a pilaster , an engaged column or buttress can support the structure of a wall and roof above . In human anatomy , a pilaster is a ridge that extends vertically across the femur , which is unique to modern humans . Its structural function is unclear .",
  "/wiki/Adelaide_Crescent": "Adelaide Crescent is a mid-19th-century residential development in Hove , part of the English city and seaside resort of Brighton and Hove . Conceived as an ambitious attempt to rival the large , high-class Kemp Town estate east of Brighton , the crescent was not built to its original plan because time and money were insufficient . Nevertheless , together with its northerly neighbour Palmeira Square ( with which it is continuous ) , it forms one of Hove 's most important architectural set-pieces . Building work started in 1830 to the design of Decimus Burton . The adjacent land was originally occupied by the world 's largest conservatory , the Anthaeum ; its collapse stopped construction of the crescent , which did not resume until the 1850s . The original design was modified and the crescent was eventually finished in the mid-1860s . Together with the Kemp Town and Brunswick Town estates , the crescent is one of the foremost pre-Victorian residential developments in the Brighton area : it has been claimed that outside Bath , [ they ] have no superior in England . The buildings in the main part of Adelaide Crescent are Grade II* listed . Some of the associated buildings at the sea-facing south end are listed at the lower Grade II .",

At the southern end it adjoins Adelaide Crescent , another architectural set-piece which leads down to the seafront ; large terraced houses occupy its west and east sides , separated by a public garden ; and at the north end is one of Hove 's main road junctions . This is also called Palmeira Square , and its north side is lined with late 19th-century terraced mansions . Commercial buildings and a church also stand on the main road , which is served by many buses ( some of which terminate there ) . The land was originally occupied by the world 's largest conservatory , the Anthaeum - a visitor attraction planned by botanist , author and building promoter Henry Phillips . The giant dome 's collapse and total destruction on the day it was due to open in 1833 made Phillips go blind from shock , and the debris occupied the site for many years . Work began in the early 1850s and was largely complete in the mid-1860s , although commercial and residential buildings such as Palmeira House and Gwydyr Mansions continued to be added at the northern end throughout the late 19th century . English Heritage has listed the residential buildings on the western , eastern and northern sides of the square at Grade II for their architectural and historical importance , although one building has the higher Grade II* status because of its opulent custom-designed interior .",
  "/wiki/Stucco": "Stucco or render is a construction material made of aggregates , a binder , and water . Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid . It is used as a decorative coating for walls and ceilings , and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture . Stucco may be used to cover less visually appealing construction materials , such as metal , concrete , cinder block , or clay brick and adobe . In English , stucco usually refers to a coating for the outside of a building and plaster to a coating for interiors ; as described below , the material itself is often little different . However , other European languages , notably including Italian , do not have the same distinction ; stucco means plaster in Italian and serves for both . This has led to English-speakers sometimes using stucco for interior decorative plasterwork in relief .",
  "/wiki/Parapet": "A parapet is a barrier which is an extension of the wall at the edge of a roof , terrace , balcony , walkway or other structure . The word comes ultimately from the Italian parapetto ( parare to cover/defend and petto breast ) . The German equivalent Br\u00fcstung has the same meaning . Where extending above a roof , a parapet may simply be the portion of an exterior wall that continues above the edge line of the roof surface , or may be a continuation of a vertical feature beneath the roof such as a fire wall or party wall . Parapets were originally used to defend buildings from military attack , but today they are primarily used as guard rails and to prevent the spread of fires . In the Bible the Hebrews are obligated to build a parapet on the roof of their houses to prevent people falling .",
  "/wiki/Carlton_Hill,_Brighton": "Carlton Hill is an inner-city area of Brighton , part of the English city and seaside resort of Brighton and Hove . First developed in the early and mid-19th century on steeply sloping farmland east of central Brighton , it grew rapidly as the town became a fashionable , high-class destination . Carlton Hill 's population was always poor , though , and by the early 20th century the area was Brighton 's worst slum : overcrowding , crime and disease were rife . Extensive slum clearance in the mid-20th century introduced high-density tower blocks , but some old buildings remain : in 2008 , Brighton and Hove City Council designated part of Carlton Hill as the city 's 34th conservation area . The area now has housing of various styles and ages , large offices and small-scale industry ; there are also churches , a school and some open space . Carlton Hill 's pattern of development was defined by the long-established structure of land ownership around Brighton , whereby land was divided into long , narrow strips with many different owners . This encouraged the development of terraced housing - the predominant housing pattern until the council undertook large-scale demolition and high-density rebuilding in the mid-20th century . This work introduced more open space and varied land uses : Brighton Art College was able to expand into the area , and American Express opened a large , visually dominant headquarters . Buildings lost during the 20th century include schools and several chapels serving various Christian denominations . The former St John the Evangelist 's Anglican church was declared redundant and sold to Brighton 's Greek Orthodox community ; meanwhile , a distinctive Modernist church was built in the 1960s for Spiritualists . A cluster of historic early 19th-century houses and other structures survived the redevelopment , and several were awarded listed status by English Heritage . These buildings and their surroundings were afforded further protection in 2008 when the city council designated the Carlton Hill conservation area .",
  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",
  "/wiki/Classical_architecture": "Classical architecture usually denotes architecture which is more or less consciously derived from the principles of Greek and Roman architecture of classical antiquity , or sometimes even more specifically , from the works of the Roman architect Vitruvius . Different styles of classical architecture have arguably existed since the Carolingian Renaissance , and prominently since the Italian Renaissance . Although classical styles of architecture can vary greatly , they can in general all be said to draw on a common vocabulary of decorative and constructive elements . In much of the Western world , different classical architectural styles have dominated the history of architecture from the Renaissance until the second world war , though it continues to inform many architects to this day . The term classical architecture also applies to any mode of architecture that has evolved to a highly refined state , such as classical Chinese architecture , or classical Mayan architecture . It can also refer to any architecture that employs classical aesthetic philosophy . The term might be used differently from traditional or vernacular architecture , although it can share underlying axioms with it . For contemporary buildings following authentic classical principles , the term New Classical architecture is sometimes used .",

  "/wiki/Victorian_era": "In the history of the United Kingdom , the Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria 's reign , from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901 . The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period , and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle \u00c9poque era of Continental Europe . In terms of moral sensibilities and political reforms , this period began with the passage of the Reform Act 1832 . There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches , such as the Methodists , and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England . Britain 's relations with the other Great Powers were driven by the colonial antagonism of the Great Game with Russia , climaxing during the Crimean War ; a Pax Britannica of international free trade was maintained by the country 's naval and industrial supremacy . Britain embarked on global imperial expansion , particularly in Asia and Africa , which made the British Empire the largest empire in history . National self-confidence peaked . Ideologically , the Victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the Georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism with regard to religion , social values , and arts . Domestically , the political agenda was increasingly liberal , with a number of shifts in the direction of gradual political reform , social reform , and the widening of the franchise . There were unprecedented demographic changes : the population of England and Wales almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901 , and Scotland 's population also rose rapidly , from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million in 1901 . However , Ireland 's population decreased sharply , from 8.2 million in 1841 to less than 4.5 million in 1901 , mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine . Between 1837 and 1901 about 15 million emigrated from Great Britain , mostly to the United States , Canada , South Africa , New Zealand , and Australia .",

  "/wiki/Regency_architecture": "Regency architecture encompasses classical buildings built in the United Kingdom during the Regency era in the early 19th century when George IV was Prince Regent , and also to earlier and later buildings following the same style . The period coincides with the Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands , Federal style in the United States and the French Empire style . Regency style is also applied to interior design and decorative arts of the period , typified by elegant furniture and vertically striped wallpaper , and to styles of clothing ; for men , as typified by the dandy Beau Brummell , for women the Empire silhouette . The style is strictly the late phase of Georgian architecture , and follows closely on from the neo-classical style of the preceding years , which indeed continued to be produced throughout the period . The Georgian period takes its name from the four Kings George of the period 1714-1830 , including King George IV . The British Regency strictly lasted only from 1811 to 1820 , but the term is applied to architecture more widely , both before 1811 and after 1820 ; the next reign , of William IV from 1830 to 1837 , has not been given its own stylistic descriptor . Regency architecture is especially distinctive in its houses , and also marked by an increase in the use of a range of eclectic revival styles , from Gothic through Greek to Indian , as alternatives to the main neoclassical stream . The opening years of the style were marked by greatly reduced levels of building because of the Napoleonic Wars , which saw government spending on building eliminated , shortages of imported timber , and high taxes on other building materials . In 1810 there was a serious financial crisis , though the only major asset class not to lose value was houses , at least in London , mainly because the low level of recent building had created pent-up demand . After the decisive victory at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 ended the wars for good , there was a long financial boom amid greatly increased British self-confidence . Most Regency architecture comes from this period .",
  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

Terracotta is the term normally used for sculpture made in earthenware , and also for various practical uses including vessels ( notably flower pots ) , water and waste water pipes , roofing tiles , bricks , and surface embellishment in building construction . The term is also used to refer to the natural brownish orange color of most terracotta , which varies considerably . [ citation needed ] This article covers the senses of terracotta as a medium in sculpture , as in the Terracotta Army and Greek terracotta figurines , and architectural decoration . Asian and European sculpture in porcelain is not covered . Glazed architectural terracotta and its unglazed version as exterior surfaces for buildings were used in Asia for some centuries before becoming popular in the West in the 19th century . Architectural terracotta can also refer to decorated ceramic elements such as antefixes and revetments , which made a large contribution to the appearance of temples and other buildings in the classical architecture of Europe , as well as in the Ancient Near East .

Mosaic skinning ( covering objects with mosaic glass ) is done with thin enameled glass and opaque stained glass . Modern mosaic art is made from any material in any size ranging from carved stone , bottle caps , and found objects to fruit and pieces of toast . Mosaics have a long history , starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC . Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece ; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times , both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome . Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics . Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries ; that tradition was adopted by the Norman Kingdom of Sicily in the 12th century , by the eastern-influenced Republic of Venice , and among the Rus in Ukraine .",
  "/wiki/British_Engineerium": "The British Engineerium ( formerly Brighton and Hove Engineerium ) is an engineering and steam power museum in Hove , East Sussex . It is housed in the Goldstone Pumping Station , a set of High Victorian Gothic buildings started in 1866 . The Goldstone Pumping Station supplied water to the local area for more than a century before it was converted to its present use . The site has been closed to the public since 2006 , and in March 2018 the entire complex was put up for sale . At its greatest extent , between 1884 and 1952 , the complex consisted of two boiler houses with condensing engines , a chimney , coal cellars , workshop , cooling pond , leat and underground reservoir . Situated on top of a naturally fissured chalk hollow , it provided vast quantities of water to the rapidly growing towns of Hove and its larger neighbour , the fashionable seaside resort of Brighton , for more than a century . As new sources of water were found elsewhere and more modern equipment installed to exploit them , the pumping station 's importance declined , and by 1971 the Brighton Water Department had closed it and threatened the complex with demolition . An industrial archaeologist offered to restore the buildings and machinery in return for a lease from the Brighton Water Corporation , and a charitable trust was formed to enable this . Expertise developed by the Engineerium 's employees and volunteers was exploited across the world : they founded museums , undertook restoration projects and trained young people in engineering heritage conservation . Another enthusiast subsequently bought the complex , and as of 2020 it is closed to the public while more restoration and extension work takes place . The High Victorian Gothic buildings are a landmark in Hove , and are a good example of the 19th-century ethos that utility definitely does not equal dullness in industrial buildings . Polychrome brickwork , moulded dressings and facings , decorative gables and elaborate windows characterise all the structures - even the 95-foot ( 29 m ) chimney , which stands apart from the main buildings like a campanile .",

The other two are the Doric order which was the earliest , followed by the Ionic order . When classical architecture was revived during the Renaissance , two more orders were added to the canon : the Tuscan order and the Composite order . The Corinthian , with its offshoot the Composite , is the most ornate of the orders . This architectural style is characterized by slender fluted columns and elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves and scrolls . There are many variations . The name Corinthian is derived from the ancient Greek city of Corinth , although the style had its own model in Roman practice , following precedents set by the Temple of Mars Ultor in the Forum of Augustus ( c. 2 AD ) . It was employed in southern Gaul at the Maison Carr\u00e9e , N\u00eemes and at the comparable Temple of Augustus and Livia [ fr ] at Vienne .

Stucco-clad terraced housing and villas predominate , but two of the city 's most significant Victorian churches and a landmark hospital building are also in the area , which lies immediately northwest of Brighton city centre and spreads as far as the ancient parish boundary with Hove . Development was initially stimulated when one of the main roads out of Brighton was turnpiked in the late 18th century , but the hilly land - condemned as hideous masses of unfledged earth by John Constable , who painted it nevertheless - was mostly devoted to agriculture until the 1820s . The ascent of Brighton from provincial fishing town to fashionable resort prompted a building boom in the next quarter-century , and Montpelier and Clifton Hill were transformed into districts of architecturally homogeneous streets with carefully designed , intricately detailed housing . Little demolition , infilling or redevelopment has occurred since , and hundreds of buildings have been granted listed status . The whole suburb is also one of 34 conservation areas in the city of Brighton and Hove . Historic buildings include The Temple - local landowner Thomas Read Kemp 's house , now a private school - the former Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children , currently being redeveloped , and large mid 19th-century houses such as Montpelier Hall .

An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",

  "/wiki/Dutch_gable": "A Dutch gable or Flemish gable is a gable whose sides have a shape made up of one or more curves and has a pediment at the top .

The preceding is the strict definition , but the term is sometimes used more loosely , though the stepped gable should be distinguished from it . The term Dutch gable is also used in America and Australasia to refer to a gablet roof . The Dutch gable was a notable feature of the Renaissance architecture , which spread to northern Europe from the Low Countries , arriving in Britain during the latter part of the 16th century . Later Dutch gables with flowing curves became absorbed into Baroque architecture . Examples of Dutch-gabled buildings can be found in historic cities across Europe . In Potsdam , Germany , 150 red brick houses featuring steep Dutch gables form part of the city 's Dutch Quarter , while in Bruges , Belgium , a wide range of buildings featuring Dutch gables can be found . The Flemish culture also had a strong architectural impact in Arras , northern France . The style also spread beyond Europe , for example Barbados is well known for the Dutch gables on its historic buildings . Dutch settlers in South Africa also brought with them building styles from the Netherlands which included the use of prominent Dutch gables but adjusted to the Western Cape region where the style became known as Cape Dutch architecture .

English Heritage has listed it at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance .",
  "/wiki/Mathematical_tile": "Mathematical tiles are a building material used extensively in the southeastern counties of England - especially East Sussex and Kent - in the 18th and early 19th centuries . They were laid on the exterior of timber-framed buildings as an alternative to brickwork , which their appearance closely resembled . A distinctive black variety with a glazed surface was used on many buildings in Brighton ( now part of the city of Brighton and Hove ) from about 1760 onwards , and is considered a characteristic feature of the town 's early architecture . Although the brick tax ( 1784-1850 ) was formerly thought to have encouraged use of mathematical tiles , in fact the tiles were subject to the same tax .",
  "/wiki/Hip_roof": "A hip roof , hip-roof or hipped roof , is a type of roof where all sides slope downwards to the walls , usually with a fairly gentle slope ( although a tented roof by definition is a hipped roof with steeply pitched slopes rising to a peak ) . Thus , a hipped roof house has no gables or other vertical sides to the roof . A square hip roof is shaped like a pyramid . Hip roofs on houses could have two triangular sides and two trapezoidal ones . A hip roof on a rectangular plan has four faces . They are almost always at the same pitch or slope , which makes them symmetrical about the centerlines . Hip roofs often have a consistent level fascia , meaning that a gutter can be fitted all around . Hip roofs often have dormer slanted sides .",
  "/wiki/Gable": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",
  "/wiki/Hove_Museum_and_Art_Gallery": "Hove Museum and Art Gallery is a municipally-owned museum in the town of Hove , which is part of the larger city of Brighton and Hove in the South East of England .

  "/wiki/Barford_Court,_Hove": "Barford Court is a care home operated by the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution and situated on the seafront in Hove , part of the English city of Brighton and Hove . The building , completed in 1937 , has had this function only since 1996 ; it was constructed by cinema architect Robert Cromie as a private house for Ian Stuart Millar , an eccentric iron industry tycoon , who occupied it for only nine years . The large building later accommodated the Brighton and Hove School of Nursing , which for the first time brought together training provision for all local hospitals ' staff on one site . When the school moved away in 1989 , the house spent several years on the market awaiting a buyer - and in steadily deteriorating structural condition - before being refurbished , extended , renamed and converted to its present use . The building is distinctive and idiosyncratic in its layout , positioning , materials and architectural style . Many interior touches are reminiscent of interwar Art Deco cinema architecture , contrasting with the austere Neo-Georgian exterior . Handmade , specially commissioned bricks in an unusual purplish grey colour were used to build the house , which is surrounded by a high wall of the same material . The layout was designed to accommodate the motor-car at a time when they were uncommon , with garaging space integrated into the design of the ground floor . Several design motifs recur throughout , and high-quality internal fittings such as built-in furniture and an unusual staircase have been preserved . English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance . The surrounding wall is also listed separately at Grade II .",
  "/wiki/Art_Deco": "Art Deco , sometimes referred to as Deco , is a style of visual arts , architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I . Art Deco influenced the design of buildings , furniture , jewelry , fashion , cars , movie theatres , trains , ocean liners , and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners . It took its name , short for Arts D\u00e9coratifs , from the Exposition internationale des arts d\u00e9coratifs et industriels modernes ( International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts ) held in Paris in 1925 . It combined modern styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials . During its heyday , Art Deco represented luxury , glamour , exuberance , and faith in social and technological progress . Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles , sometimes contradictory , united by a desire to be modern . From its outset , Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession ; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes ; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe I and Louis XVI ; and the exotic styles of China and Japan , India , Persia , ancient Egypt and Maya art . It featured rare and expensive materials , such as ebony and ivory , and exquisite craftsmanship . The Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style . In the 1930s , during the Great Depression , Art Deco became more subdued . New materials arrived , including chrome plating , stainless steel , and plastic . A sleeker form of the style , called Streamline Moderne , appeared in the 1930s ; it featured curving forms and smooth , polished surfaces .",
  "/wiki/Portslade": "Portslade is a western suburb of the city of Brighton and Hove , England . Portslade Village , the original settlement a mile inland to the north , was built up in the 16th century . The arrival of the railway from Brighton in 1840 encouraged rapid development of the coastal area and in 1896 the southern part , formerly known as Copperas Gap , was granted urban district status and renamed Portslade-by-Sea , making it distinct from Portslade Village . After World War II the district of Mile Oak to the north was added . Today , Portslade is bisected from east to west by the old A27 road ( now the A270 ) between Brighton and Worthing , each part having a distinct character . Portslade Village , to the north , nestles in a valley of the South Downs and still retains its rural character with flint buildings , a village green and the small parish church of St Nicolas , which is the second-oldest church in the city , dating from approximately 1150 . Another notable building in the village is Portslade Manor , one of the few surviving ruins of a Norman manor . It was built in the 12th century and is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument . Foredown Tower houses a camera obscura , one of only two in the south of England . It is open to the public . Portslade-by-Sea , to the south , straddles the small but busy seaport harbour basin of Shoreham harbour and is the industrial centre of Brighton and Hove ; the Monarch 's Way long-distance footpath follows the seafront west towards Shoreham . Terraced housing dating back to the 19th century is interspaced with parks and allotments .",

  "/wiki/Bargeboard": "Bargeboard ( probably from Medieval Latin bargus , or barcus , a scaffold , and not from the now obsolete synonym vergeboard ) is a board fastened to the projecting gables of a roof to give them strength , protection , and to conceal the otherwise exposed end of the horizontal timbers or purlins of the roof to which they were attached . Bargeboards are sometimes moulded only or carved , but as a rule the lower edges were cusped and had tracery in the spandrels besides being otherwise elaborated . An example in Britain was one at Ockwells in Berkshire ( built 1446-1465 ) , which was moulded and carved as if it were intended for internal work . In New Orleans , bargeboard is the wood from which many of the creole cottages were constructed in the early to mid-1800s . Barges were constructed up-river to carry goods to New Orleans , and upon arrival dismantled and used for construction of houses . The planks are generally 2 inches ( 5.1 cm ) thick and of varying lengths and widths , although 10 inches ( 25 cm ) width is common . It is hard , solid wood that has lasted between 150 and 200 years in a wet , humid climate . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/St_Augustine's_Church,_Brighton": "St Augustine 's Church is a former Anglican church in Brighton , part of the English city of Brighton and Hove . It is close to the Preston Park and Round Hill areas in the central northern part of the city . Built in 1896 and extended in 1914 , its parish was extended after a nearby church closed , but in 2003 it was declared redundant itself . The building , which is listed at Grade II in view of its architectural importance , has stood empty since then , apart from a few years from 2004 when the building was leased by the Elim Pentecostal Church . The Pentecostal congregation made free-standing internal changes to create internal spaces which could be heated in winter , but did not touch the fabric of the building ."
