  "/wiki/Interstellar_medium": "In astronomy , the interstellar medium ( ISM ) is the matter and radiation that exists in the space between the star systems in a galaxy . This matter includes gas in ionic , atomic , and molecular form , as well as dust and cosmic rays . It fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding intergalactic space . The energy that occupies the same volume , in the form of electromagnetic radiation , is the interstellar radiation field . The interstellar medium is composed of multiple phases distinguished by whether matter is ionic , atomic , or molecular , and the temperature and density of the matter . The interstellar medium is composed , primarily , of hydrogen , followed by helium with trace amounts of carbon , oxygen , and nitrogen comparatively to hydrogen . The thermal pressures of these phases are in rough equilibrium with one another . Magnetic fields and turbulent motions also provide pressure in the ISM , and are , typically , more important , dynamically , than the thermal pressure is . In all phases , the interstellar medium is extremely tenuous by terrestrial standards . In cool , dense regions of the ISM , matter is primarily in molecular form , and reaches number densities of 106 molecules per cm3 ( 1 million molecules per cm3 ) . In hot , diffuse regions of the ISM , matter is primarily ionized , and the density may be as low as 10\u22124 ions per cm3 . Compare this with a number density of roughly 1019 molecules per cm3 for air at sea level , and 1010 molecules per cm3 ( 10 billion molecules per cm3 ) for a laboratory high-vacuum chamber .",
  "/wiki/Earth": "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life . According to radiometric dating and other evidence , Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago . Earth 's gravity interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon , which is Earth 's only natural satellite . Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days , a period known as an Earth sidereal year . During this time , Earth rotates about its axis about 366.256 times . [ n 6 ] Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane , producing seasons on Earth . The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides , stabilizes Earth 's orientation on its axis , and gradually slows its rotation . Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets . Earth 's outer layer ( lithosphere ) is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years . About 71% of Earth 's surface is covered with water , mostly by oceans . The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together contain many lakes , rivers and other fresh water , which , together with the oceans , constitute the hydrosphere . The majority of Earth 's polar regions are covered in ice , including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack .",
  "/wiki/Earth's_inner_core": "Earth 's inner core is the innermost geologic layer of the Earth . It is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1,220 kilometres ( 760 miles ) , which is about 20% of the Earth 's radius or 70% of the Moon 's radius . There are no samples of the Earth 's core available for direct measurement , as there are for the Earth 's mantle . Information about the Earth 's core mostly comes from analysis of seismic waves and the Earth 's magnetic field . The inner core is believed to be composed of an iron-nickel alloy with some other elements . The temperature at the inner core 's surface is estimated to be approximately 5700 K ( 5430 \u00b0C or 9806 \u00b0F ) , which is about the temperature at the surface of the Sun .",
  "/wiki/Sun": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System . It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma , with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process . It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth . Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers ( 864,000 miles ) , or 109 times that of Earth , and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth . It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System . Roughly three quarters of the Sun 's mass consists of hydrogen ( ~73% ) ; the rest is mostly helium ( ~25% ) , with much smaller quantities of heavier elements , including oxygen , carbon , neon , and iron . The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star ( G2V ) based on its spectral class . As such , it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf ( its light is closer to white than yellow ) . It formed approximately 4.6 billion [ a ] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud . Most of this matter gathered in the center , whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System . The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core . It is thought that almost all stars form by this process .",
  "/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole": "A supermassive black hole ( SMBH or sometimes SBH ) is the largest type of black hole , containing a mass of the order of hundreds of thousands to billions of times the mass of the Sun ( M\u2609 ) . Black holes are a class of astronomical object that have undergone gravitational collapse , leaving behind spheroidal regions of space from which nothing can escape , not even light . Observational evidence indicates that nearly all large galaxies contain a supermassive black hole , located at the galaxy 's center . In the case of the Milky Way , the supermassive black hole corresponds to the location of Sagittarius A* at the Galactic Core . Accretion of interstellar gas onto supermassive black holes is the process responsible for powering quasars and other types of active galactic nuclei .",
  "/wiki/Event_horizon": "In astrophysics , an event horizon is a boundary beyond which events can not affect an observer . John Michell proposed in 1784 that near compact massive objects , gravity would increase to the extent that even light can not escape . At that time , Newtonian gravity theory and the so called corpuscular ( particle ) theory of light were dominating , and the idea was that if required escape speed would be exceeding the speed of light , then light originating inside or from such distance could escape temporarily but would return . Later , in 1958 , David Finkelstein using General Relativity introduced a more strict definition of a local black hole event horizon as a boundary beyond which events of any kind can not affect any outside observer . This strict definition has led to information and firewall paradoxes , therefore , local event horizons and the notion of black holes were widely re-examined , and several theories have been developed , some with , and some without , event horizons . Stephen Hawking , one of front line developers of black hole theories , has suggested an apparent horizon be used instead of event horizon , saying gravitational collapse produces apparent horizons but no event horizons and eventually arrived at the conclusion that The absence of event horizons mean that there are no black holes - in the sense of regimes from which light ca n't escape to infinity . This does not mean denying the existence of black holes , it merely expresses the distrust towards the conventional strict definition of event horizon . Any object approaching the horizon from the observer 's side appears to slow down and never quite pass through the horizon , with its image becoming more and more redshifted as time elapses . This means that the wavelength of the light emitted from the object is getting longer as the object moves away from the observer . An event horizon is an acknowledged feature of an expanding universe . The speed of expansion reaches and even exceeds the speed of light , therefore any signals can not reach to or from such regions . A Cosmic event horizon is a real event horizon because it affects all kinds of signals , including gravitational waves which are proceeding at light speed .",
  "/wiki/White_dwarf": "A white dwarf , also called a degenerate dwarf , is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter . A white dwarf is very dense : its mass is comparable to that of the Sun , while its volume is comparable to that of Earth . A white dwarf 's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy ; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf . The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B , at 8.6 light years , the smaller component of the Sirius binary star . There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun . The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910.:1 The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922 . White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star , that of about 10 solar masses . This includes over 97% of the other stars in the Milky Way . : \u00a71 After the hydrogen-fusing period of a main-sequence star of low or medium mass ends , such a star will expand to a red giant during which it fuses helium to carbon and oxygen in its core by the triple-alpha process . If a red giant has insufficient mass to generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon ( around 1 billion K ) , an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center . After such a star sheds its outer layers and forms a planetary nebula , it will leave behind a core , which is the remnant white dwarf . Usually , white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen .",
  "/wiki/Atomic_nuclei": "The atomic nucleus is the small , dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center of an atom , discovered in 1911 by Ernest Rutherford based on the 1909 Geiger-Marsden gold foil experiment . After the discovery of the neutron in 1932 , models for a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by Dmitri Ivanenko and Werner Heisenberg . An atom is composed of a positively-charged nucleus , with a cloud of negatively-charged electrons surrounding it , bound together by electrostatic force . Almost all of the mass of an atom is located in the nucleus , with a very small contribution from the electron cloud . Protons and neutrons are bound together to form a nucleus by the nuclear force . The diameter of the nucleus is in the range of 1.7566 fm ( 1.7566\u00d710\u221215 m ) for hydrogen ( the diameter of a single proton ) to about 11.7142 fm for the heaviest atom uranium . These dimensions are much smaller than the diameter of the atom itself ( nucleus + electron cloud ) , by a factor of about 26,634 ( uranium atomic radius is about 156 pm ( 156\u00d710\u221212 m ) ) to about 60,250 ( hydrogen atomic radius is about 52.92 pm ) . [ a ] The branch of physics concerned with the study and understanding of the atomic nucleus , including its composition and the forces which bind it together , is called nuclear physics .",
  "/wiki/Neutron_star": "A neutron star is the collapsed core of a giant star which before collapse had a total mass of between 10 and 29 solar masses . Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars , excluding black holes , hypothetical white holes , quark stars and strange stars . Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres ( 6.2 mi ) and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses . They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star , combined with gravitational collapse , that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei . Once formed , they no longer actively generate heat , and cool over time ; however , they may still evolve further through collision or accretion . Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons ( subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons ) ; the electrons and protons present in normal matter combine to produce neutrons at the conditions in a neutron star . Neutron stars are partially supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure , a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle , just as white dwarfs are supported against collapse by electron degeneracy pressure . However neutron degeneracy pressure is not by itself sufficient to hold up an object beyond 0.7M\u2609 and repulsive nuclear forces play a larger role in supporting more massive neutron stars . If the remnant star has a mass exceeding the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit of around 2 solar masses , the combination of degeneracy pressure and nuclear forces is insufficient to support the neutron star and it continues collapsing to form a black hole . Neutron stars that can be observed are very hot and typically have a surface temperature of around 600000 K. [ a ] They are so dense that a normal-sized matchbox containing neutron-star material would have a weight of approximately 3 billion tonnes , the same weight as a 0.5 cubic kilometre chunk of the Earth ( a cube with edges of about 800 metres ) from Earth 's surface . Their magnetic fields are between 108 and 1015 ( 100 million to 1 quadrillion ) times stronger than Earth 's magnetic field . The gravitational field at the neutron star 's surface is about 2\u00d71011 ( 200 billion ) times that of Earth 's gravitational field .",
  "/wiki/Black_hole": "A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing - no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light - can escape from it . The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole . The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon . Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it , no locally detectable features appear to be observed . In many ways , a black hole acts like an ideal black body , as it reflects no light . Moreover , quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation , with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass . This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass , making it essentially impossible to observe . Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace . The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916 , although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by David Finkelstein in 1958 . Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity ; it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity . The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality . Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle ."
