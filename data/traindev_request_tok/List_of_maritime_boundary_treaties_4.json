  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

Some geothermal activity still occurs today , on the islands of Vanua Levu and Taveuni . The geothermal systems on Viti Levu are non-volcanic in origin , with low-temperature ( c. 35-60 degrees Celsius ) surface discharges . Sabeto Hot Springs near Nadi is a good example .",

The treaty was signed in Suva on 19 January 1983 . The text of the treaty is brief and states that the boundaries will be set by the principle of setting an equidistant line between the territories . The boundary with New Caledonia is to the southwest of Fiji and consists of one maritime straight-line segment defined by two specific points . For purposes of drawing the border , the treaty assumes that France has sovereignty over Matthew and Hunter Islands , but since Vanuatu also claims sovereignty over the islands , the treaty states that the treaty is without prejudice to the sovereign rights of any neighbouring State . The boundary with Wallis and Futuna is to the northeast of Fiji and consists of four straight-line segments , defined by five individual coordinate points . The agreement came into force on 21 August 1984 , after both states had ratified it . The Fiji - Wallis and Futuna boundary was adjusted slightly by a 1990 codicil to the treaty .

Its total land area is 4,167 square kilometres ( 1,609 sq mi ) .

The island country lies east-northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands ( which belong to the Solomon Islands ) , southeast of Nauru , south of Kiribati , west of Tokelau , northwest of Samoa and Wallis and Futuna , and north of Fiji . It is composed of three reef islands and six true atolls spread out between the latitude of 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 south and longitude of 176\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 , west of the International Date Line . Tuvalu has a population of 11,192 ( 2017 census ) . The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres ( 10 sq mi ) . The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians . The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about three thousand years ago . During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the islands as Polynesian navigation skills are recognised to have allowed deliberate journeys on double-hull sailing canoes or outrigger canoes . The pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls , with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to further migration into the Polynesian outliers in Melanesia and Micronesia . In 1568 , Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a was the first European to sail through the archipelago , sighting the island of Nui during his expedition in search of Terra Australis . The island of Funafuti was named Ellice 's Island in 1819 ; the name Ellice was applied to all of the nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay . The Ellice Islands came into Great Britain 's sphere of influence in the late 19th century , as the result of a treaty between Great Britain and Germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the Pacific Ocean .",
