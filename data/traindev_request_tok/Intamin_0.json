  "/wiki/Linear_induction_motor": "A linear induction motor ( LIM ) is an alternating current ( AC ) , asynchronous linear motor that works by the same general principles as other induction motors but is typically designed to directly produce motion in a straight line . Characteristically , linear induction motors have a finite primary or secondary length , which generates end-effects , whereas a conventional induction motor is arranged in an endless loop . Despite their name , not all linear induction motors produce linear motion ; some linear induction motors are employed for generating rotations of large diameters where the use of a continuous primary would be very expensive . As with rotary motors , linear motors frequently run on a three-phase power supply and can support very high speeds . However , there are end-effects that reduce the motor 's force , and it is often not possible to fit a gearbox to trade off force and speed . Linear induction motors are thus frequently less energy efficient than normal rotary motors for any given required force output . LIMs , unlike their rotary counterparts , can give a levitation effect . They are therefore often used where contactless force is required , where low maintenance is desirable , or where the duty cycle is low . Their practical uses include magnetic levitation , linear propulsion , and linear actuators . They have also been used for pumping liquid metals .",
  "/wiki/Impulse_roller_coaster": "An Impulse roller coaster is a form of a launched inverted roller coaster manufactured by Intamin . The first Impulse roller coaster appeared in Japan , and the ride type has since evolved to include four specific layouts , three of these varieties being built in the United States . It uses LIMs to launch a train out of the station and ( in most installations ) up a vertical spiral . The train then falls backwards , is powered again through the station , and heads up a back tower . The train then falls forwards , and continues in this fashion for a total of 2\u00bd cycles per ride ( three forward launches , two backwards ) . On the final forward launch , with a slightly reduced speed , the train is sent up the front tower , and brakes then deploy on the launch track . The train then slows down and heads back into the station .",
