  "/wiki/Rome": "Rome ( Latin and Italian : Roma [ \u02c8ro\u02d0ma ] ( listen ) ) is the capital city and a special comune of Italy ( named Comune di Roma Capitale ) . Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region . With 2,879,728 residents in 1,285 km2 ( 496.1 sq mi ) , it is also the country 's most populated comune . It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits . It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome , which has a population of 4,355,725 residents , thus making it the second or third most populous metropolitan city in Italy depending on definition . Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula , within Lazio ( Latium ) , along the shores of the Tiber . Vatican City ( the smallest country in the world ) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome , the only existing example of a country within a city ; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states . Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis . It was first called The Eternal City ( Latin : Urbs Aeterna ; Italian : La Citt\u00e0 Eterna ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC , and the expression was also taken up by Ovid , Virgil , and Livy .",

It constitutes both a county and a municipality . During the Viking Age the area was part of Viken , the northernmost Danish province . Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in the year 1040 under the name \u00c1nslo , and established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada . The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300 . Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence . After being destroyed by a fire in 1624 , during the reign of King Christian IV , a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in the king 's honour . It was established as a municipality ( formannskapsdistrikt ) on 1 January 1838 . The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814-1905 union between Sweden and Norway . From 1877 , the city 's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage , a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities only in 1897 . In 1925 the city , after incorporating the village retaining its former name , was renamed Oslo . In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker , a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger , thus creating the modern , vastly enlarged Oslo municipality .",
