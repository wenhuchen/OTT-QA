His father , Hamilcar Barca , was a leading Carthaginian commander during the First Punic War ( 264-241 BC ) . His younger brothers were Mago and Hasdrubal , and he was brother-in-law to Hasdrubal the Fair ; all also commanded Carthaginian armies . Hannibal lived during a period of great tension in the western Mediterranean Basin , triggered by the emergence of the Roman Republic as a great power after it had established its supremacy over Italy . Although Rome had won the First Punic War , revanchism prevailed in Carthage , symbolised by the alleged pledge that Hannibal made to his father never to be a friend of Rome . The Second Punic War broke out in 218 after Hannibal 's attack on Saguntum , an ally of Rome in Hispania . He then made his famous military exploit of carrying war to Italy by crossing the Alps with his African elephants . In his first few years in Italy , he won a succession of dramatic victories at the Trebia , Lake Trasimene , and Cannae . He distinguished himself for his ability to determine his and his opponent 's respective strengths and weaknesses , and to plan battles accordingly . Hannibal 's well-planned strategies allowed him to conquer several Italian cities allied to Rome . Hannibal occupied most of southern Italy for 15 years , but could not win a decisive victory , as the Romans led by Fabius Maximus avoided confrontation with him , instead waging a war of attrition . A counter-invasion of North Africa led by Scipio Africanus forced him to return to Carthage .",
