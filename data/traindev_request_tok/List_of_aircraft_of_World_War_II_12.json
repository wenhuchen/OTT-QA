Curtiss named the SO3C the Seamew but in 1941 the US Navy began calling it by the name Seagull , the same name as the aircraft it replaced ( the Curtiss SOC a biplane type ) , causing some confusion . The British Royal Navy kept the Curtiss name , ( Seamew ) , for the SO3Cs that they ordered .

It was initially operated primarily as a fleet attack aircraft . During its later years , the Swordfish became increasingly used as an anti-submarine and training platform . The type was in frontline service throughout the Second World War , but it was already considered obsolete at the outbreak of the conflict in 1939 . Nonetheless , the Swordfish achieved some spectacular successes during the war . Notable events included sinking one battleship and damaging two others of the Regia Marina ( the Italian Navy ) during the Battle of Taranto , and the famous attack on the Bismarck , which contributed to her eventual demise . By the end of the war , the Swordfish held the distinction of having caused the destruction of a greater tonnage of Axis shipping than any other Allied aircraft . The Swordfish remained in front-line service until V-E Day , having outlived multiple aircraft that had been intended to replace it in service .",
