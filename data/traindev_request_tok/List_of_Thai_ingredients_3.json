The Thai alphabet itself ( as used to write Thai ) has 44 consonant symbols ( Thai : \u0e1e\u0e22\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e30 , phayanchana ) , 16 vowel symbols ( Thai : \u0e2a\u0e23\u0e30 , sara ) that combine into at least 32 vowel forms , and four tone diacritics ( Thai : \u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e22\u0e38\u0e01\u0e15\u0e4c or \u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e22\u0e38\u0e15 , wannayuk or wannayut ) to create characters mostly representing syllables . Although commonly referred to as the Thai alphabet , the script is in fact not a true alphabet but an abugida , a writing system in which the full characters represent consonants with diacritical marks for vowels ; the absence of a vowel diacritic gives an implied ' a ' or ' o ' . Consonants are written horizontally from left to right , with vowels arranged above , below , to the left , or to the right of the corresponding consonant , or in a combination of positions . Thai has its own set of Thai numerals that are based on the Hindu-Arabic numeral system ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 , lek thai ) , but the standard western Hindu-Arabic numerals ( Thai : \u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e2e\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e39\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e01 , lek hindu arabik ) are mainly used except for government documents and the license plates of military vehicles .",

  "/wiki/Coconut_milk": "Coconut milk is an opaque , milky-white liquid extracted from the grated pulp of mature coconuts . The opacity and rich taste of coconut milk is due to its high oil content , most of which is saturated fat . Coconut milk is a traditional food ingredient used in Southeast Asia , Oceania , South Asia , and East Africa . It is also used for cooking in the Caribbean , tropical Latin America , and West Africa , where coconuts were introduced during the colonial era . Coconut milk is differentiated into subtypes based on fat content . They can be generalized into coconut cream ( or thick coconut milk ) with the highest amount of fat ; coconut milk ( or thin coconut milk ) with a maximum of around 20% fat ; and coconut skim milk with negligible amounts of fat . This terminology is not always followed in commercial coconut milk sold in western countries . Coconut milk can also be used to produce milk substitutes ( differentiated as coconut milk beverages ) . These products are not the same as regular coconut milk products which are meant for cooking , not drinking . A sweetened , processed , coconut milk product from Puerto Rico is also known as cream of coconut .

The onion plant has a fan of hollow , bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached . The bulbs are composed of shortened , compressed , underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale ( leaves ) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem . In the autumn ( or in spring , in the case of overwintering onions ) , the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle .
