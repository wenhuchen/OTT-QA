He played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the Philadelphia Phillies , Philadelphia Athletics ( twice ) , and Cleveland Naps between 1896 and 1916 . He managed the Naps from 1905 through 1909 . Lajoie was signed to the National League 's ( NL ) Phillies in 1896 . By the beginning of the twentieth century , however , the upstart American League ( AL ) was looking to rival the supremacy of the NL and in 1901 , Lajoie and dozens of former National League players joined the American League . National League clubs contested the legality of contracts signed by players who jumped to the other league but eventually , Lajoie was allowed to play for Connie Mack 's Athletics . During the season , Lajoie set the all-time American League single-season mark for the highest batting average ( .426 ) . : p.76 : p.88 One year later , Lajoie went to the Cleveland Bronchos where he would play until the 1915 season when he returned to play for Mack and the Athletics . While with Cleveland , Lajoie 's popularity led to locals electing to change the club 's team name from Bronchos to Napoleons ( Naps for short ) , which remained until after Lajoie departed Cleveland and the name was changed to Indians ( the team 's present-day name ) . Lajoie led the AL in batting average five times in his career and four times recorded the highest number of hits . During several of those years with the Naps he and Ty Cobb dominated AL hitting categories and traded batting titles with each other , most notably coming in 1910 , when the league 's batting champion was not decided until well after the last game of the season and after an investigation by American League President Ban Johnson . Lajoie in 1914 joined Cap Anson and Honus Wagner as the only major league players to record 3,000 career hits .",

However , the names Senators , Nationals and shorter Nats were used interchangeably by fans and media for the next 60 years ; in 2005 , the latter two names were revived for the current National League franchise that had previously played in Montreal . For a time , from 1911 to 1933 , the Senators were one of the more successful franchises in Major League Baseball . The team 's rosters included Baseball Hall of Fame members Goose Goslin , Sam Rice , Joe Cronin , Bucky Harris , Heinie Manush and one of the greatest players and pitchers of all time , Walter Johnson . But the Senators are remembered more for their many years of mediocrity and futility , including six last-place finishes in the 1940s and 1950s . Joe Judge , Cecil Travis , Buddy Myer , Roy Sievers and Eddie Yost were other notable Senators players whose careers were spent in obscurity due to the team 's lack of success .",

Founded in 1901 as one of the American League 's eight charter franchises , the Red Sox ' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since 1912 . The Red Sox name was chosen by the team owner , John I. Taylor , circa 1908 , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the Boston Red Stockings , including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves . The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league , defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918 . However , they then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history , dubbed the Curse of the Bambino after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox ' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after their world championship in 1918 , an 86-year wait before the team 's sixth World Championship in 2004 . The team 's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history , including Enos Slaughter 's mad dash in 1946 , the Impossible Dream of 1967 , Carlton Fisk 's home run in 1975 , and Bill Buckner 's error in 1986 .

He is remembered for his performance on the field and for his association with the Black Sox Scandal , in which members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox participated in a conspiracy to fix the World Series . As a result of Jackson 's association with the scandal , Kenesaw Mountain Landis , Major League Baseball 's first commissioner , banned Jackson from playing after the 1920 season despite his exceptional play in the 1919 World Series , in which he led both teams in several statistical categories and set a World Series record with 12 base hits . Since then , Jackson 's guilt has been fiercely debated with new accounts claiming his innocence and urging Major League Baseball to reconsider his banishment .
