  "/wiki/Comedy_film": "A comedy film is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor . These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect . Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending ( black comedy being an exception ) . One of the oldest genres in film - and derived from the classical comedy in theatre - , some of the very first silent movies were comedies , as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions , without requiring sound . When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s , comedy films took another swing , as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue . Comedy , compared with other film genres , puts much more focus on individual stars , with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity . While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse , others contain political or social commentary ( such as The King of Comedy and Wag the Dog ) .",

Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",

Action films tend to feature a resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds , which include life-threatening situations , a villain , or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the hero ( though a small number of films in this genre have ended in the victory for the villain instead ) . Advancements in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past . However , reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed , as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic , highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism . While action has long been a recurring component in films , the action film genre began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and special effects . Common action scenes in films are generally , but not limited to , explosions , car chases , fistfights , and shootouts . This genre is closely associated with the thriller and adventure genres , and they may also contain elements of drama and spy fiction .",

He is best known for writing and playing his on-stage and television alter egos Dame Edna Everage and Sir Les Patterson . He is also a film producer and script writer , a star of London 's West End musical theatre , an award-winning writer , and an accomplished landscape painter . For his delivery of dadaist and absurdist humour to millions , biographer Anne Pender described Humphries in 2010 as not only the most significant theatrical figure of our time \u2026 [ but ] the most significant comedian to emerge since Charlie Chaplin . Humphries ' characters have brought him international renown , and he also appeared in numerous stage productions , films , and television shows . Originally conceived as a dowdy Moonee Ponds housewife who caricatured Australian suburban complacency and insularity , Dame Edna Everage has evolved over four decades to become a satire of stardom - a gaudily dressed , acid-tongued , egomaniacal , internationally f\u00eated Housewife Gigastar . Humphries ' other satirical characters include the priapic and inebriated cultural attach\u00e9 Sir Les Patterson , who has continued to bring worldwide discredit upon Australian arts and culture , while contributing as much to the Australian vernacular as he has borrowed from it ; gentle , grandfatherly returned gentleman Sandy Stone ; iconoclastic 1960s underground film-maker Martin Agrippa , Paddington socialist academic Neil Singleton ; sleazy trade union official Lance Boyle ; high-pressure art salesman Morrie O'Connor ; and failed tycoon Owen Steele , and archetypal Australian bloke Barry McKenzie .",

Thriller films ' characters conflict with each other or with an outside force , which can sometimes be abstract .

Thriller films are typically hybridized with other genres ; hybrids commonly including : action thrillers , adventure thrillers , fantasy and science fiction thrillers .
