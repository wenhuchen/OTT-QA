  "/wiki/Goalkeeper": "In many team sports which involve scoring goals , the goalkeeper ( sometimes termed goaltender , netminder , goalie or keeper ) is a designated player charged with directly preventing the opposing team from scoring by blocking or intercepting opposing shots on goal . Such positions exist in bandy , rink bandy , camogie , association football , Gaelic football , international rules football , floorball , handball , hurling , field hockey , ice hockey , roller hockey , lacrosse , ringette , rinkball , water polo , and shinty as well as in other sports . In most sports which involve scoring in a net , special rules apply to the goalkeeper that do not apply to other players . These rules are often instituted to protect the goalkeeper ( being a target for dangerous or even violent actions ) . This is most apparent in sports such as ice hockey and lacrosse , where goalkeepers are required to wear special equipment like heavy pads and a face mask to protect their bodies from the impact of the playing object ( eg . ball or puck . ) In some sports , goalkeepers may have the same rights as other players ; in association football , for example , the keeper is allowed to kick the ball just as any other player , but may also use their hands to handle the ball in a restricted area . In other sports , goalkeepers may be limited in the actions they are allowed to take or the area of the field or rink where they may be ; in the NHL , for example , goalkeepers may not play the puck in the restricted areas behind the net or take the puck across the red line .",

  "/wiki/Midfielder": "A midfielder is an association football position . Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team 's defenders and forwards . Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role , breaking up attacks , and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders . Others blur the boundaries , being more mobile and efficient in passing : they are commonly referred to as deep-lying midfielders , play-makers , box-to-box , or holding midfielders . The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team 's formation ; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield . Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team 's attacks , while others may be tasked with creating goals , or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence . Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match . Because midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game they are among the fittest players on the pitch .",
