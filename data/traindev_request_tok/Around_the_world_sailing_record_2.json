  "/wiki/Sunday_Times_Golden_Globe_Race": "The Sunday Times Golden Globe Race was a non-stop , single-handed , round-the-world yacht race , held in 1968-1969 , and was the first round-the-world yacht race . The race was controversial due to the failure of most competitors to finish the race and because of the suicide of one entrant ; however , it ultimately led to the founding of the BOC Challenge and Vend\u00e9e Globe round-the-world races , both of which continue to be successful and popular . The race was sponsored by the British Sunday Times newspaper and was designed to capitalise on a number of individual round-the-world voyages which were already being planned by various sailors ; for this reason , there were no qualification requirements , and competitors were offered the opportunity to join and permitted to start at any time between 1 June and 31 October 1968 . The Golden Globe trophy was offered to the first person to complete an unassisted , non-stop single-handed circumnavigation of the world via the great capes , and a separate \u00a35,000 prize was offered for the fastest single-handed circumnavigation . Nine sailors started the race ; four retired before leaving the Atlantic Ocean . Of the five remaining , Chay Blyth , who had set off with absolutely no sailing experience , sailed past the Cape of Good Hope before retiring ; Nigel Tetley sank with 1,100 nautical miles ( 2,000 km ) to go while leading ; Donald Crowhurst , who , in desperation , attempted to fake a round-the-world voyage to avoid financial ruin , began to show signs of mental illness , and then committed suicide ; and Bernard Moitessier , who rejected the philosophy behind a commercialised competition , abandoned the race while in a strong position to win and kept sailing non-stop until he reached Tahiti after circling the globe one and a half times . Robin Knox-Johnston was the only entrant to complete the race , becoming the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world . He was awarded both prizes , and later donated the \u00a35,000 to a fund supporting Crowhurst 's family .",
