  "/wiki/Hercules": "Hercules ( /\u02c8h\u025c\u02d0rkjuli\u02d0z , -j\u0259-/ ) is a Roman hero and god . He was the Roman equivalent of the Greek divine hero Heracles , who was the son of Zeus ( Roman equivalent Jupiter ) and the mortal Alcmene . In classical mythology , Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures . The Romans adapted the Greek hero 's iconography and myths for their literature and art under the name Hercules . In later Western art and literature and in popular culture , Hercules is more commonly used than Heracles as the name of the hero . Hercules was a multifaceted figure with contradictory characteristics , which enabled later artists and writers to pick and choose how to represent him . This article provides an introduction to representations of Hercules in the later tradition .",
  "/wiki/Roman_mythology": "Roman mythology is the body of traditional stories pertaining to ancient Rome 's legendary origins and religious system , as represented in the literature and visual arts of the Romans . Roman mythology may also refer to the modern study of these representations , and to the subject matter as represented in the literature and art of other cultures in any period . The Romans usually treated their traditional narratives as historical , even when these have miraculous or supernatural elements . The stories are often concerned with politics and morality , and how an individual 's personal integrity relates to his or her responsibility to the community or Roman state . Heroism was an important theme . When the stories illuminate Roman religious practices , they are more concerned with ritual , augury , and institutions than with theology or cosmogony . The study of Roman religion and myth is complicated by the early influence of Greek religion on the Italian peninsula during Rome 's protohistory , and by the later artistic imitation of Greek literary models by Roman authors . In matters of theology , the Romans were curiously eager to identify their own gods with those of the Greeks ( interpretatio graeca ) , and to reinterpret stories about Greek deities under the names of their Roman counterparts . Rome 's early myths and legends also have a dynamic relationship with Etruscan religion , less documented than that of the Greeks . While Roman mythology may lack a body of divine narratives as extensive as that found in Greek literature , Romulus and Remus suckling the she-wolf is as famous as any image from Greek mythology except for the Trojan Horse . Because Latin literature was more widely known in Europe throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance , the interpretations of Greek myths by the Romans often had a greater influence on narrative and pictorial representations of classical mythology than Greek sources . In particular , the versions of Greek myths in Ovid 's Metamorphoses , written during the reign of Augustus , came to be regarded as canonical .",

  "/wiki/Aircraft_pilot": "An aircraft pilot or aviator is a person who controls the flight of an aircraft by operating its directional flight controls . Some other aircrew members , such as navigators or flight engineers , are also considered aviators , because they are involved in operating the aircraft 's navigation and engine systems .

In recognition of the pilots ' qualifications and responsibilities , most militaries and many airlines worldwide award aviator badges to their pilots .",
  "/wiki/Don_Bradman": "Sir Donald George Bradman , AC ( 27 August 1908 - 25 February 2001 ) , often referred to as The Don , was an Australian international cricketer , widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time . Bradman 's career Test batting average of 99.94 has been cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport . The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore . Bradman 's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years . Before his 22nd birthday , he had set many records for top scoring , some of which still stand , and became Australia 's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression . During a 20-year playing career , Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him , in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull , worth three batsmen to Australia . A controversial set of tactics , known as Bodyline , was specially devised by the England team to curb his scoring . As a captain and administrator , Bradman was committed to attacking , entertaining cricket ; he drew spectators in record numbers . He hated the constant adulation , however , and it affected how he dealt with others . The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some teammates , administrators and journalists , who thought him aloof and wary . Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War , he made a dramatic comeback , captaining an Australian team known as The Invincibles on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England . A complex , highly driven man , not given to close personal relationships , Bradman retained a pre-eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator , selector and writer for three decades following his retirement .",
  "/wiki/Cricket": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre ( 22-yard ) pitch with a wicket at each end , each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps . The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat , while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player ( so they are out ) . Means of dismissal include being bowled , when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails , and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat , but before it hits the ground . When ten players have been dismissed , the innings ends and the teams swap roles . The game is adjudicated by two umpires , aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches . They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match 's statistical information . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs , to Test matches , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length . Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit , but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours . In addition to the basic kit , some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball , which is a hard , solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core which is layered with tightly wound string . Historically , cricket 's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England in the middle of the 16th century . It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire , leading to the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century . The game 's governing body is the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) , which has over 100 members , twelve of which are full members who play Test matches .",

  "/wiki/Australian_rules_football": "Australian rules football , officially known as Australian football , or simply called Aussie rules , football or footy , is a contact sport played between two teams of eighteen players on an oval-shaped field , often a modified cricket ground . Points are scored by kicking the oval-shaped ball between the middle goal posts ( worth six points ) or between a goal and behind post ( worth one point ) . During general play , players may position themselves anywhere on the field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball . The primary methods are kicking , handballing and running with the ball . There are rules on how the ball can be handled : for example , players running with the ball must intermittently bounce or touch it on the ground . Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught holding the ball . A distinctive feature of the game is the mark , where players anywhere on the field who catch the ball from a kick ( with specific conditions ) are awarded possession . Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a free kick or mark is paid . Players can tackle using their hands or use their whole body to obstruct opponents . Dangerous physical contact ( such as pushing an opponent in the back ) , interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks , distance penalties or suspension for a certain number of matches , depending on the seriousness of the infringement . The game features frequent physical contests , spectacular marking , fast movement of both players and the ball and high scoring . The sport 's origins can be traced to football matches played in Melbourne , Victoria in 1858 , inspired by English public school football games .",
