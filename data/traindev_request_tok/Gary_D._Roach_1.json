Until June 23 , 2016 , Bradley 's father John Bradley , Navy corpsman , was misidentified as being one of the figures who raised the second flag , and incorrectly depicted on the memorial as the third bronze statue from the base of the flagstaff with the 32-foot ( 9.8-m ) bronze statues of the other five flag-raisers on the monument . The film is taken from the American viewpoint of the Battle of Iwo Jima , while its companion film , Letters from Iwo Jima , which Eastwood also directed , is from the Japanese viewpoint of the battle .
