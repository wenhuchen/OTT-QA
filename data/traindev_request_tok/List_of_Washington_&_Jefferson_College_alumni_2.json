  "/wiki/General_Consul": "A consul is an official representative of the government of one state in the territory of another , normally acting to assist and protect the citizens of the consul 's own country , and to facilitate trade and friendship between the people of the two countries . A consul is distinguished from an ambassador , the latter being a representative from one head of state to another , but both have a form of immunity . There can be only one ambassador from one country to another , representing the first country 's head of state to that of the second , and his or her duties revolve around diplomatic relations between the two countries ; however , there may be several consuls , one in each of several major cities , providing assistance with bureaucratic issues to both the citizens of the consul 's own country traveling or living abroad and to the citizens of the country in which the consul resides who wish to travel to or trade with the consul 's country . A less common usage is an administrative consul , who takes a governing role and is appointed by a country that has colonised or occupied another .",

  "/wiki/James_G._Blaine": "James Gillespie Blaine ( January 31 , 1830 - January 27 , 1893 ) was an American statesman and Republican politician who represented Maine in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1863 to 1876 , serving as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1869 to 1875 , and then in the United States Senate from 1876 to 1881 . Blaine twice served as Secretary of State ( 1881 , 1889-1892 ) , one of only two persons to hold the position under three separate presidents ( the other being Daniel Webster ) , and unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for President in 1876 and 1880 before being nominated in 1884 . In the general election , he was narrowly defeated by Democrat Grover Cleveland . Blaine was one of the late 19th century 's leading Republicans and champion of the moderate reformist faction of the party known as the Half-Breeds . Blaine was born in the western Pennsylvania town of West Brownsville and after college moved to Maine , where he became a newspaper editor . Nicknamed the Magnetic Man , he was a charismatic speaker in an era that prized oratory . He began his political career as an early supporter of Abraham Lincoln and the Union war effort in the American Civil War . In Reconstruction , Blaine was a supporter of black suffrage , but opposed some of the more coercive measures of the Radical Republicans . Initially a protectionist , he later worked for a reduction in the tariff and an expansion of American trade with foreign countries . Railroad promotion and construction were important issues in his time , and as a result of his interest and support , Blaine was widely suspected of corruption in the awarding of railroad charters , especially with the emergence of the Mulligan letters ; these allegations plagued his 1884 presidential candidacy . As Secretary of State , Blaine was a transitional figure , marking the end of an isolationist era in foreign policy and foreshadowing the rise of the American Century that would begin with the Spanish-American War . His efforts at expanding the United States ' trade and influence began the shift to a more active American foreign policy .",

  "/wiki/1884_United_States_presidential_election": "The 1884 United States presidential election was the 25th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 4 , 1884 . It saw the first election of a Democrat as President of the United States since 1856 . Governor Grover Cleveland of New York defeated Republican James G. Blaine of Maine . The election was set apart by unpleasant mudslinging and shameful allegations that eclipsed substantive issues , for example , civil administration change . Cleveland won the presidential nomination on the second ballot of the 1884 Democratic National Convention . President Chester A. Arthur had acceded to the presidency in 1881 following the assassination of James A. Garfield , but he was unsuccessful in his bid for nomination to a full term . Blaine , who had served as Secretary of State under President Garfield , defeated Arthur and other candidates on the fourth ballot of the 1884 Republican National Convention . A group of reformist Republicans known as Mugwumps abandoned Blaine 's candidacy , viewing him as corrupt . The campaign was marred by exceptional political acrimony and personal invective . Blaine 's reputation for public corruption and his inadvertent alienation of Catholic voters proved decisive . In the election , Cleveland won 48.9% of the nationwide popular vote and 219 electoral votes , carrying the Solid South and several key swing states . Blaine won 48.3% of the popular vote and 182 electoral votes .",
  "/wiki/Grover_Cleveland": "Stephen Grover Cleveland ( March 18 , 1837 - June 24 , 1908 ) was an American politician and lawyer who was the 22nd and 24th president of the United States , the only president in American history to serve two non-consecutive terms in office ( 1885-1889 and 1893-1897 ) . [ b ] He won the popular vote for three presidential elections - in 1884 , 1888 , and 1892 - and was one of two Democrats ( with Woodrow Wilson ) to be elected president during the era of Republican political domination dating from 1861 to 1933 . Born to a Presbyterian minister , Cleveland grew up in upstate New York . In 1881 , he was elected Mayor of Buffalo and later , governor of New York . Cleveland was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs ; Free Silver ; inflation ; imperialism ; and subsidies to business , farmers , or veterans . His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era . Cleveland won praise for his honesty , self-reliance , integrity , and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism . He fought political corruption , patronage , and bossism . As a reformer , Cleveland had such prestige that the like-minded wing of the Republican Party , called Mugwumps , largely bolted the GOP presidential ticket and swung to his support in the 1884 election . As his second administration began , disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression , which Cleveland was unable to reverse . It ruined his Democratic Party , opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896 . The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era .",
  "/wiki/Half-Breed_(politics)": "The Half-Breeds were a political faction of the United States Republican Party in the late 19th century . The Half-Breeds were a moderate group , and were the opponents of the Stalwarts , the other main faction of the Republican Party . The main issue that divided the Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds was political patronage . The Stalwarts were in favor of political machines and spoils system-style patronage , while the Half-Breeds , led by Maine senator James G. Blaine , were in favor of civil service reform and a merit system . The epithet Half-Breed was invented in derision by the Stalwarts to denote those whom they perceived as being only half Republican . In the 1880 Republican National Convention , the Stalwart candidate , former president Ulysses S. Grant , was pitted against Half-Breed James G. Blaine for the party nomination . Grant 's campaign was led by Stalwart leader Roscoe Conkling of New York , the state with the deepest split between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds . Despite Conkling 's attempts at imposing a unit-rule in the Republican National Convention by which a state 's votes would be grouped together for only one candidate , a number of Stalwarts went against him by vocalizing their support for the Half-Breed Blaine . The Half-Breeds united to defeat the unit-rule in a vote , and elected Half-Breed George Frisbie Hoar to the position as temporary chairman of the convention . Both sides knew there was no chance of victory for either candidate , and the Half-Breeds chose James Garfield as a compromise candidate . Garfield won the party 's nomination on the thirty-sixth ballot , and won the 1880 presidential election . Blaine was chosen as Garfield 's Secretary of State , and carried heavy influence over the political appointments Garfield issued for congressional approval .",
  "/wiki/Reconstruction_Era": "The Reconstruction era was the period in American history which lasted from 1863 to 1877 . It was a significant chapter in the history of American civil rights . The term has two applications : the first applies to the complete history of the entire country from 1865 to 1877 following the American Civil War ; the second , to the attempted transformation of the 11 former Confederate states from 1863 to 1877 , as directed by Congress , and the role of the Union states in that transformation . Reconstruction ended the remnants of Confederate secession and abolished slavery , making the newly freed slaves citizens with civil rights ostensibly guaranteed by three new constitutional amendments . Three visions of Civil War memory appeared during Reconstruction : the reconciliationist vision , which was rooted in coping with the death and devastation the war had brought ; the white supremacist vision , which included segregation and the preservation of the traditional cultural standards of the South ; and the emancipationist vision , which sought full freedom , citizenship , and constitutional equality for African Americans . When President Abraham Lincoln , a Republican , was assassinated at the end of the Civil War , Vice President Andrew Johnson , a Democrat from Tennessee and former slave holder , became president . Johnson favored rapid measures to bring the South back into the Union , allowing the Southern states to determine the rights of former slaves . Radical Republicans in Congress sought stronger , federal measures to upgrade the rights of African Americans , including the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , while curtailing the rights of former Confederates , such as through the provisions of the Wade-Davis Bill . Johnson , the most prominent Southerner to oppose the Confederacy , followed a lenient policy toward ex-Confederates . Lincoln 's last speeches show that he was leaning toward supporting the suffrage of all freedmen , whereas Johnson and the Democratic Party were strongly opposed to this . Johnson 's weak Reconstruction policies prevailed until the congressional elections of 1866 . Those elections followed outbreaks of violence against blacks in the former rebel states , including the Memphis riots of 1866 and the New Orleans massacre of 1866 .",

[ Note 7 ] Germany regarded its operations in the region as part of its overall war efforts on the Eastern Front and provided Finland with critical material support and military assistance . The Continuation War began 15 months after the end of the Winter War , also fought between Finland and the USSR . There have been numerous reasons proposed for the Finnish decision to invade , with regaining territory lost during the Winter War being regarded as the most common . Other justifications for the conflict included President Ryti 's vision of a Greater Finland and Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim 's desire to retake Karelia . Plans for the attack were developed jointly between the Wehrmacht and a small faction of Finnish political and military leaders with the rest of the government remaining ignorant . Despite the co-operation in this conflict , Finland never formally signed the Tripartite Pact that had established the Axis powers and justified its alliance with Germany as self-defence . In June 1941 , with the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union , the Finnish Defence Forces launched their offensive following Soviet airstrikes . By September 1941 , Finland had reversed its post-Winter War concessions to the Soviet Union by retaking the Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia .

Ministries of the Interior in these other countries correspond primarily to the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S . Cabinet and secondarily to the Department of Justice . Because the policies and activities of the Department of the Interior and many of its agencies have a substantial impact in the Western United States , the Secretary of the Interior has typically come from a western state ; only three of the individuals to hold the office since 1949 have not been from a state lying west of the Mississippi River .

  "/wiki/Henry_Stanbery": "Henry Stanbery ( February 20 , 1803 - June 26 , 1881 ) was an American lawyer from Ohio . He was most notable for his service as Ohio 's first attorney general from 1846 to 1851 and the United States Attorney General from 1866 to 1868 . A native of New York City who was raised in Zanesville , Ohio , Stanbery was a superior student who graduated from Washington College in 1819 at age 16 , studied law with two Zanesville attorneys , and attained admission to the bar as soon as he reached the minimum required age of 21 . Stanbery resided for many years in Lancaster , where he practiced law in partnership with Thomas Ewing . Stanbery was selected by the state legislature to serve as Ohio 's first state attorney general , a post he held from 1846 to 1851 . After leaving office he relocated to the Cincinnati area , where he continued to practice law . In 1866 , Stanbery was appointed U.S. Attorney General . He served until 1868 and worked to sustain President Andrew Johnson 's view that the president should control post-Civil War Reconstruction , and that the former Confederate states should be readmitted to the Union even if they took no steps to guarantee rights to former slaves . In 1868 , Stanbery resigned so he could join Johnson 's defense team during his impeachment trial . Johnson was acquitted , and Johnson attempted to reappoint him as attorney general , but the U.S. Senate would not confirm him . After Johnson left office , Stanbery returned to the Cincinnati area , where he continued to practice law until failing eyesight curbed his activities in 1880 . He traveled to New York City for surgery to remove cataracts , which did not improve his vision , and he was blind for the last six months of his life .",

  "/wiki/Andrew_Johnson": "Andrew Johnson ( December 29 , 1808 - July 31 , 1875 ) was the 17th president of the United States , serving from 1865 to 1869 . Johnson assumed the presidency as he was vice president of the United States at the time of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln . A Democrat who ran with Lincoln on the National Union ticket , Johnson came to office as the Civil War concluded . He favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the Union without protection for the former slaves . This led to conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress , culminating in his impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868 . Johnson was subsequently acquitted in the Senate by one vote . Johnson 's main accomplishment as president was the Alaska purchase . Johnson was born in poverty in Raleigh , North Carolina , and never attended school . Apprenticed as a tailor , he worked in several frontier towns before settling in Greeneville , Tennessee . He served as alderman and mayor there before being elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1835 . After brief service in the Tennessee Senate , Johnson was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1843 , where he served five two-year terms . He became governor of Tennessee for four years , and was elected by the legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1857 .",
  "/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson": "The impeachment of Andrew Johnson was initiated on February 24 , 1868 , when the United States House of Representatives resolved to impeach Andrew Johnson , the 17th president of the United States , for high crimes and misdemeanors , which were detailed in 11 articles of impeachment . The primary charge against Johnson was violation of the Tenure of Office Act , passed by Congress in March 1867 , over his veto . Specifically , he had removed from office Edwin M. Stanton , the secretary of war - whom the act was largely designed to protect - and attempted to replace him with Brevet Major General Lorenzo Thomas ( earlier , while the Congress was not in session , Johnson had suspended Stanton and appointed General Ulysses S. Grant as secretary of war ad interim ) . Johnson became the first American president to be impeached on March 2-3 , 1868 , when the House formally adopted the articles of impeachment and forwarded them to the United States Senate for adjudication . The trial in the Senate began three days later , with Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase presiding . On May 16 , the Senate did not convict Johnson on one of the articles , with the 35-19 vote in favor of conviction falling short of the necessary two-thirds majority by a single vote . A 10-day recess was called before attempting to convict him on additional articles . The delay did not change the outcome , however , as on May 26 , the Senate did not convict the president on two articles , both by the same margin , after which the trial was adjourned without considering the remaining eight articles of impeachment . The impeachment and trial of Andrew Johnson had important political implications for the balance of federal legislative-executive power . It maintained the principle that Congress should not remove the president from office simply because its members disagreed with him over policy , style , and administration of the office . It also resulted in diminished presidential influence on public policy and overall governing power , fostering a system of governance which Woodrow Wilson referred to in the 1870s as Congressional Government . Johnson remained the only U.S. president to have been impeached and face a Senate trial for over a century , until Bill Clinton became the second in 1998 .",
