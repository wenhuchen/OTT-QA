Born in Burwood , New South Wales ( a suburb of Sydney ) as one of six children of Alec Dennis , a policeman who acted as a police prosecutor , Clare and her siblings were taught to swim by their father , himself an amateur swimmer , after their family relocated from Burwood to Clovelly Beach . Dennis ' sister Thora developed quickly into a competent competitive swimmer , and joined the Sydney Ladies ' Swimming Club and was later selected for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam , but was prevented from going on the grounds of being too young to travel alone overseas . Dennis pleaded with her father to let her join , which he agreed to on the condition that she first swim the 33 yards ( approximately 30 metres ) across Clovelly Bay . She managed this by pushing off the bottom of the ocean , disguising this with extravagant stroking . Her first lesson and race at the club ended in her having to be fished out of the pool after her endurance failed and the bottom of the pool was too deep to push off . Dennis attended Randwick Primary School , where she acquired a reputation for being interested in sport rather than schoolwork . She spent large amounts of time playing cricket against the male students . Dennis initially swam as a freestyler , but converted to breaststroke at the age of 13 . At her first New South Wales Championships in 1930 , held at the Ramsgate Baths , she was disqualified after drifting out of her unmarked lane .

  "/wiki/Sydney": "Sydney ( /\u02c8s\u026adni/ ( listen ) SID-nee ) is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania . Located on Australia 's east coast , the metropolis surrounds Port Jackson and extends about 70 km ( 43.5 mi ) on its periphery towards the Blue Mountains to the west , Hawkesbury to the north , the Royal National Park to the south and Macarthur to the south-west . Sydney is made up of 658 suburbs , 40 local government areas and 15 contiguous regions . Residents of the city are known as Sydneysiders . As of June 2017 , Sydney 's estimated metropolitan population was 5,230,330 and is home to approximately 65% of the state 's population . Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000 years , and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region , making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites . During his first Pacific voyage in 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia , making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area . In 1788 , the First Fleet of convicts , led by Arthur Phillip , founded Sydney as a British penal colony , the first European settlement in Australia . Phillip named the city Sydney in recognition of Thomas Townshend , 1st Viscount Sydney . Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842 . A gold rush occurred in the colony in 1851 , and over the next century , Sydney transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre . After World War II , it experienced mass migration and became one of the most multicultural cities in the world .",
  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

She lost to Clare Dennis a mere 0.1 of a second . During the post-Olympic celebration after her return to Japan , she stated that she was considering to retire from competitive swimming due to family issues , but then Tokyo mayor Hidejir\u014d Nagata reportedly asked her why she did not bring back a gold medal . Over the next four years , Maehata trained very hard , and set a new world record for the 200-meter breaststroke on September 30 , 1933 . During the 1936 Berlin Olympics , Maehata competed in a dead heat against the reigning German national champion , Martha Genenger , winning the gold medal for the Women 's 200 m breaststroke by over one second .

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south .

Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",
