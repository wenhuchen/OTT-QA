  "/wiki/Berlin": "Berlin ( /b\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8l\u026an/ ; German : [ b\u025b\u0281\u02c8li\u02d0n ] ( listen ) ) is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population . Its 3,748,148 ( 2018 ) inhabitants make it the most populous city proper of the European Union . The city is one of Germany 's 16 federal states . It is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg , and contiguous with Potsdam , Brandenburg 's capital . The two cities are at the center of the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region , which is , with about six million inhabitants and an area of more than 30,000 km\u00b2 , Germany 's third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions . Berlin straddles the banks of the River Spree , which flows into the River Havel ( a tributary of the River Elbe ) in the western borough of Spandau . Among the city 's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree , Havel , and Dahme rivers ( the largest of which is Lake M\u00fcggelsee ) . Due to its location in the European Plain , Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate . About one-third of the city 's area is composed of forests , parks , gardens , rivers , canals and lakes . The city lies in the Central German dialect area , the Berlin dialect being a variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian dialects . First documented in the 13th century and situated at the crossing of two important historic trade routes , Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg ( 1417-1701 ) , the Kingdom of Prussia ( 1701-1918 ) , the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) , the Weimar Republic ( 1919-1933 ) , and the Third Reich ( 1933-1945 ) . Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world .",
  "/wiki/Weimar_Republic": "The Weimar Republic ( German : Weimarer Republik [ \u02c8va\u026ama\u0281\u0250 \u0281epu\u02c8bli\u02d0k ] ( listen ) ) is an unofficial historical designation for the German state from 1918 to 1933 . The name derives from the city of Weimar , where its constitutional assembly first took place . The official name of the republic remained Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) unchanged from 1871 , because of the German tradition of substates . Although commonly translated as German Empire , the word Reich here better translates as realm , in that the term does not necessarily have monarchical connotations in itself . The Reich was changed from a constitutional monarchy into a republic . In English , the country was usually known simply as Germany . Germany became a de facto republic on 9 November 1918 when Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated the German and Prussian thrones with no agreement made on a succession by his son Crown Prince Wilhelm , and became a de jure republic in February 1919 when the position of President of Germany was created . A national assembly was convened in Weimar , where a new constitution for Germany was written and adopted on 11 August 1919 . In its fourteen years , the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems , including hyperinflation , political extremism ( with contending paramilitaries ) as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War . Resentment in Germany towards the Treaty of Versailles was strong especially on the political right where there was great anger towards those who had signed and submitted to the treaty . The Weimar Republic fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations ( by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan ) . Under the Locarno Treaties , Germany accepted the western borders of the country by abandoning irredentist claims on France and Belgium , but continued to dispute the eastern borders and sought to persuade Austria to join Germany as one of Germany 's states .",

  "/wiki/Fascist_Italy_(1922\u20131943)": "Fascist Italy is the era of National Fascist Party government from 1922 to 1943 with Benito Mussolini as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy . The Italian Fascists imposed totalitarian rule and crushed political and intellectual opposition , while promoting economic modernization , traditional social values and a rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church . According to Payne ( 1996 ) , [ the ] Fascist government passed through several relatively distinct phases . The first phase ( 1923-1925 ) was nominally a continuation of the parliamentary system , albeit with a legally-organized executive dictatorship . The second phase ( 1925-1929 ) was the construction of the Fascist dictatorship proper . The third phase ( 1929-1934 ) was with less activism . The fourth phase ( 1935-1940 ) was characterized by an aggressive foreign policy : Second Italo-Ethiopian War , which was launched from Eritrea and Somaliland ; confrontations with the League of Nations , leading to sanctions ; growing economic autarky ; invasion of Albania ; and the signing of the Pact of Steel . The fifth phase ( 1940-1943 ) was World War II itself which ended in military defeat , while the sixth and final phase ( 1943-1945 ) was the rump Sal\u00f2 Government under German control . Italy was a leading member of the Axis powers in World War II , battling on several fronts with initial success . However , after the German-Italian defeat in Africa and Soviet Union and the subsequent Allied landings in Sicily , King Victor Emmanuel III overthrew and arrested Mussolini , and the Fascist Party in areas ( south of Rome ) controlled by the Allied invaders was shut down . The new government signed an armistice with the Allies on September 1943 . Nazi Germany , with Fascists ' help , seized control of the northern half of Italy and freed Mussolini , setting up the Italian Social Republic , a collaborationist puppet state still led by Mussolini and his Fascist loyalists .",
  "/wiki/Sounding_rocket": "A sounding rocket , sometimes called a research rocket , is an instrument-carrying rocket designed to take measurements and perform scientific experiments during its sub-orbital flight . The rockets are used to carry instruments from 30 to 90 miles ( 48 to 145 km ) above the surface of the Earth , the altitude generally between weather balloons and satellites ; the maximum altitude for balloons is about 25 mi ( 40 km ) and the minimum for satellites is approximately 75 mi ( 121 km ) . Certain sounding rockets have an apogee between 620 and 930 miles ( 1,000 and 1,500 km ) , such as the Black Brant X and XII , which is the maximum apogee of their class . Sounding rockets often use military surplus rocket motors . NASA routinely flies the Terrier Mk 70 boosted Improved Orion , lifting 600-1,000-pound ( 270-450 kg ) payloads into the exoatmospheric region between 60 and 125 miles ( 97 and 201 km ) .",
  "/wiki/Nazi_Germany": "Nazi Germany is the common English name for Germany between 1933 and 1945 , when Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) controlled the country through a dictatorship . Under Hitler 's rule , Germany became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government . The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich ( German Reich ) until 1943 and Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich ( Greater German Reich ) from 1943 to 1945 . Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich ( Drittes Reich ) , meaning Third Realm or Third Empire , the first two being the Holy Roman Empire ( 800-1806 ) and the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) . The Nazi regime ended after the Allies defeated Germany in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic , Paul von Hindenburg , on 30 January 1933 . The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power . Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency . A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer ( leader ) of Germany . All power was centralised in Hitler 's person and his word became the highest law . The government was not a coordinated , co-operating body , but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler 's favour . In the midst of the Great Depression , the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy .",

The charge remains until it is able to move away by means of an electric current or electrical discharge . Static electricity is named in contrast with current electricity , which flows through wires or other conductors and transmits energy . A static electric charge can be created whenever two surfaces contact and separate , and at least one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electric current ( and is therefore an electrical insulator ) . The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because people can feel , hear , and even see the spark as the excess charge is neutralized when brought close to a large electrical conductor ( for example , a path to ground ) , or a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity ( positive or negative ) . The familiar phenomenon of a static shock - more specifically , an electrostatic discharge - is caused by the neutralization of charge .",

Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair .

The Kosmos-3M uses UDMH fuel and AK27I oxidizer ( red fuming nitric acid ) to lift roughly 1,400 kg ( 3,100 lb ) of payload into orbit . It differed from the earlier Kosmos-3 in its finer control of the second-stage burn , allowing operators to tune the thrust and even channel it through nozzles that helped orient the rocket for the launching of multiple satellites at one time . PO Polyot has manufactured these launch vehicles in the Russian town of Omsk for decades . It was originally scheduled to be retired from service in 2011 ; however , in April 2010 the Commander of the Russian Space Forces confirmed that it would be retired by the end of 2010 . One further launch , with Kanopus-ST , was planned ; however , this was cancelled in late 2012 as the rocket had exceeded its design life while in storage ahead of the launch .",

Ninety-three were launched , of which one failed . Another was destroyed before launch . It was originally built as a specialised version of the earlier Vostok-2 , for injecting lighter payloads into higher sun-synchronous orbits . It was a member of the R-7 family of rockets , and the last Vostok . The Vostok-2M made its maiden flight on 28 August 1964 , from Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome , successfully placing Kosmos 44 , a Meteor weather satellite into orbit . Its only launch failure occurred on 1 February 1969 , when the launch of a Meteor failed due to an upper stage problem . At 16:01 GMT on 18 March 1980 , a Vostok-2M exploded during fueling at Plesetsk Site 43/4 , ahead of the launch of a Tselina-D satellite , killing 48 people who were working on the rocket at the time . A filter in a hydrogen peroxide tank of the third stage had accidentally been soldered with lead instead of tin , with the catalytically active lead solder on the filter causing the explosion upon contact hydrogen peroxide . As a consequence , the H2O2 broke down , overheated , and melted the solder , causing pieces to fall into the H2O2 storage tank and cause a runaway chemical reaction . This led to a fire inside the third stage and eventual explosion which resulted in the complete destruction of the launch vehicle and severe pad damage ( LC-43 did not host another launch for three years ) . Vostok-2M launches occurred from Site 31/6 at Baikonur , and Sites 41/1 and 43 at Plesetsk .",
