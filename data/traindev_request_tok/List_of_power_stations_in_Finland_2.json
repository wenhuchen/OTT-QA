  "/wiki/Biomass": "Biomass is plant or animal material used for energy production ( electricity or heat ) , or in various industrial processes as raw substance for a range of products . It can be purposely grown energy crops ( e.g . miscanthus , switchgrass ) , wood or forest residues , waste from food crops ( wheat straw , bagasse ) , horticulture ( yard waste ) , food processing ( corn cobs ) , animal farming ( manure , rich in nitrogen and phosphorus ) , or human waste from sewage plants . Burning plant-derived biomass releases CO2 , but it has still been classified as a renewable energy source in the EU and UN legal frameworks because photosynthesis cycles the CO2 back into new crops . In some cases , this recycling of CO2 from plants to atmosphere and back into plants can even be CO2 negative , as a relatively large portion of the CO2 is moved to the soil during each cycle . Cofiring with biomass has increased in coal power plants , because it makes it possible to release less CO2 without the cost associated with building new infrastructure . Co-firing is not without issues however , often an upgrade of the biomass is beneficiary . Upgrading to higher grade fuels can be achieved by different methods , broadly classified as thermal , chemical , or biochemical ( see below ) .",
  "/wiki/Peat": "Peat ( /pi\u02d0t/ ) , also known as turf ( /t\u025c\u02d0rf/ ) , is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter . It is unique to natural areas called peatlands , bogs , mires , moors , or muskegs . The peatland ecosystem is the most efficient carbon sink on the planet , because peatland plants capture CO2 naturally released from the peat , maintaining an equilibrium . In natural peatlands , the annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition , but it takes thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of 1.5 to 2.3 m [ 4.9 to 7.5 ft ] , which is the average depth of the boreal [ northern ] peatlands . Sphagnum moss , also called peat moss , is one of the most common components in peat , although many other plants can contribute . The biological features of Sphagnum mosses act to create a habitat aiding peat formation , a phenomenon termed 'habitat manipulation ' . Soils consisting primarily of peat are known as histosols . Peat forms in wetland conditions , where flooding or stagnant water obstructs the flow of oxygen from the atmosphere , slowing the rate of decomposition . Peatlands , particularly bogs , are the primary source of peat , although less-common wetlands including fens , pocosins , and peat swamp forests also deposit peat . Landscapes covered in peat are home to specific kinds of plants including Sphagnum moss , ericaceous shrubs , and sedges ( see bog for more information on this aspect of peat ) . Because organic matter accumulates over thousands of years , peat deposits provide records of past vegetation and climate by preserving plant remains , such as pollen . This allows the reconstruction of past environments and study changes in land use .",

  "/wiki/Coal": "Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock , formed as rock strata called coal seams . Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements ; chiefly hydrogen , sulfur , oxygen , and nitrogen . Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years . Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands - called coal forests - that covered much of the Earth 's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous ( Pennsylvanian ) and Permian times . As a fossil fuel burned for heat , coal supplies about a quarter of the world 's primary energy and two-fifths of its electricity . Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal . The extraction and use of coal causes many premature deaths and much illness . The coal industry damages the environment , including by climate change as it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide , 14 gigatonne ( Gt ) in 2016 , which is 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions and almost 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions . As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have stopped using or use less coal , and the UN Secretary General has asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020 . To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2 \u00b0C ( 3.6 \u00b0F ) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030 . The largest consumer and importer of coal is China . China mines almost half the world 's coal , followed by India with about a tenth .",
  "/wiki/Natural_gas": "Natural gas ( also called fossil gas ) is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane , but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes , and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide , nitrogen , hydrogen sulfide , or helium . It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years . The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas . Natural gas is a non-renewable hydrocarbon used as a source of energy for heating , cooking , and electricity generation . It is also used as a fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals . Natural gas has a complicated effect on climate change ; it itself is a greenhouse gas , and it releases carbon dioxide when burned . However , natural gas use often supplants coal use , which is far more environmentally damaging , leading to lower net carbon dioxide emissions in countries such as the United States . Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates . Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found close to and with natural gas . Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms : biogenic and thermogenic . Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes , bogs , landfills , and shallow sediments . Deeper in the earth , at greater temperature and pressure , thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material .",

  "/wiki/Wood": "Wood is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants . It is an organic material - a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression . Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees , or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs . [ citation needed ] In a living tree it performs a support function , enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves . It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves , other growing tissues , and the roots . Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties , and to material engineered from wood , or wood chips or fiber . Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel , as a construction material , for making tools and weapons , furniture and paper . More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives , such as cellophane and cellulose acetate . As of 2005 , the growing stock of forests worldwide was about 434 billion cubic meters , 47% of which was commercial . As an abundant , carbon-neutral renewable resource , woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy .
