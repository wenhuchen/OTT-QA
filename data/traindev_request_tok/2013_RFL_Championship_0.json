Historically part of Lancashire , it was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1867 and merged with Dalton-in-Furness Urban District in 1974 to form the Borough of Barrow-in-Furness . At the tip of the Furness peninsula , close to the Lake District , it is bordered by Morecambe Bay , the Duddon Estuary and the Irish Sea . In 2011 , Barrow 's population was 57,000 , making it the second largest urban area in Cumbria after Carlisle , although it is geographically closer to the whole of Lancashire and most of Merseyside . Natives of Barrow , as well as the local dialect , are known as Barrovian . In the Middle Ages , Barrow was a small hamlet within the parish of Dalton-in-Furness with Furness Abbey , now on the outskirts of the modern-day town , controlling the local economy before its dissolution in 1537 . The iron prospector Henry Schneider arrived in Furness in 1839 and , with other investors , opened the Furness Railway in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast . Further hematite deposits were discovered , of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel . For a period of the late 19th century , the Barrow Hematite Steel Company-owned steelworks was the world 's largest . Barrow 's location and the availability of steel allowed the town to develop into a significant producer of naval vessels , a shift that was accelerated during World War I and the local yard 's specialisation in submarines . The original iron- and steel-making enterprises closed down after World War II , leaving Vickers shipyard as Barrow 's main industry and employer . Several Royal Navy flagships , the vast majority of its nuclear submarines as well as numerous other naval vessels , ocean liners and oil tankers have been manufactured at the facility .",

It is the administrative seat of the Borough of Copeland , and has a town council for the parish of Whitehaven . The population of the town was 23,986 at the 2011 census . The town 's growth was largely due to the exploitation of the extensive coal measures by the Lowther family , driving a growing export of coal through the harbour from the 17th century onwards . It was also a major port for trading with the American colonies , and was , after London , the second busiest port of England by tonnage from 1750 to 1772 . This prosperity led to the creation of a Georgian planned town in the 18th century which has left an architectural legacy of over 170 listed buildings . Whitehaven has been designated a gem town by the Council for British Archaeology due to the historic quality of the town environment .
