  "/wiki/Decathlon": "The decathlon is a combined event in athletics consisting of ten track and field events .

Events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all . Performance is judged on a points system in each event , not by the position achieved . The decathlon is contested mainly by male athletes , while female athletes typically compete in the heptathlon . Traditionally , the title of World 's Greatest Athlete has been given to the person who wins the decathlon , thus the world 's greatest athlete of all times is the record-man of decathlon ( Kevin Mayer as of September 2018 ) . This began when King Gustav V of Sweden told Jim Thorpe , You , sir , are the world 's greatest athlete after Thorpe won the decathlon at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912 . The event is similar to the pentathlon held at the ancient Greek Olympics , and also similar to a competition called an all-around , which was contested at the United States amateur championships in 1884 . Another all-around was held at the 1904 Summer Olympics . The modern decathlon first appeared at the 1912 Games .

The distance or time for each event is converted to points via scoring tables , with the overall ranking determined by total points . Since 1949 the events have been sprint hurdling , high jump , shot put , long jump , and a flat race . The sprint hurdles distance was 80 m outdoors until 1969 and thereafter 100 m ; in indoor pentathlon the distance is 60 m. The flat race was 200 m until 1976 and thereafter 800 m.

Pentathlon is still contested at school and masters level and indoors .",
