  "/wiki/Small_nuclear_RNA": "Small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) is a class of small RNA molecules that are found within the splicing speckles and Cajal bodies of the cell nucleus in eukaryotic cells . The length of an average snRNA is approximately 150 nucleotides . They are transcribed by either RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III . Their primary function is in the processing of pre-messenger RNA ( hnRNA ) in the nucleus . They have also been shown to aid in the regulation of transcription factors ( 7SK RNA ) or RNA polymerase II ( B2 RNA ) , and maintaining the telomeres . snRNA are always associated with a set of specific proteins , and the complexes are referred to as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( snRNP , often pronounced snurps ) . Each snRNP particle is composed of a snRNA component and several snRNP-specific proteins ( including Sm proteins , a family of nuclear proteins ) . The most common human snRNA components of these complexes are known , respectively , as : U1 spliceosomal RNA , U2 spliceosomal RNA , U4 spliceosomal RNA , U5 spliceosomal RNA , and U6 spliceosomal RNA . Their nomenclature derives from their high uridine content . snRNAs were discovered by accident during a gel electrophoresis experiment in 1966 . An unexpected type of RNA was found in the gel and investigated . Later analysis has shown that these RNA were high in uridylate and were established in the nucleus .",
  "/wiki/Eukaryotes": "Eukaryotes ( /ju\u02d0\u02c8k\u00e6rio\u028at , -\u0259t/ ) are organisms whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within membranes , unlike prokaryotes ( Bacteria and Archaea ) , which have no membrane-bound organelles . Eukaryotes belong to the domain Eukaryota or Eukarya . Their name comes from the Greek \u03b5\u1f56 ( eu , well or true ) and \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd ( karyon , nut or kernel ) . Eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus , and in addition , some cells of plants and algae contain chloroplasts . Unlike unicellular archaea and bacteria , eukaryotes may also be multicellular and include organisms consisting of many cell types forming different kinds of tissue . Animals and plants are the most familiar eukaryotes . Eukaryotes can reproduce both asexually through mitosis and sexually through meiosis and gamete fusion . In mitosis , one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cells . In meiosis , DNA replication is followed by two rounds of cell division to produce four haploid daughter cells . These act as sex cells ( gametes ) . Each gamete has just one set of chromosomes , each a unique mix of the corresponding pair of parental chromosomes resulting from genetic recombination during meiosis . [ citation needed ] The domain Eukaryota is monophyletic and makes up one of the domains of life in the three-domain system .",
  "/wiki/Archaea": "Archaea ( /\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8ki\u02d0\u0259/ ( listen ) or /\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8ke\u026a\u0259/ ar-KEE-\u0259 or ar-KAY-\u0259 ) ( singular archaeon ) constitute a domain of single-celled organisms . These microorganisms lack cell nuclei and are therefore prokaryotes . Archaea were initially classified as bacteria , receiving the name archaebacteria ( in the Archaebacteria kingdom ) , but this classification is outmoded . They have been renamed to clarify that archaea are not only not bacteria , but are more closely related to eukaryotes ( life whose cells can have a nucleus , including humans ) than to real bacteria . Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains , Bacteria and Eukaryota . Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla . Classification is difficult because most have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment . Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape , although a few archaea have very different shapes , such as the flat and square cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi . Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria , archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes , notably for the enzymes involved in transcription and translation . Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique , such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes , including archaeols . Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes : these range from organic compounds , such as sugars , to ammonia , metal ions or even hydrogen gas . Salt-tolerant archaea ( the Haloarchaea ) use sunlight as an energy source , and other species of archaea fix carbon , but unlike plants and cyanobacteria , no known species of archaea does both .",
  "/wiki/Small_nucleolar_RNA": "Small nucleolar RNAs ( snoRNAs ) are a class of small RNA molecules that primarily guide chemical modifications of other RNAs , mainly ribosomal RNAs , transfer RNAs and small nuclear RNAs . There are two main classes of snoRNA , the C/D box snoRNAs , which are associated with methylation , and the H/ACA box snoRNAs , which are associated with pseudouridylation . SnoRNAs are commonly referred to as guide RNAs but should not be confused with the guide RNAs that direct RNA editing in trypanosomes .",
  "/wiki/SmY_RNA": "SmY ribonucleic acids ( SmY RNAs ) are a family of small nuclear RNAs found in some species of nematode worms . They are thought to be involved in mRNA trans-splicing . SmY RNAs are about 70-90 nucleotides long and share a common secondary structure , with two stem-loops flanking a consensus binding site for Sm protein . Sm protein is a shared component of spliceosomal snRNPs .",
  "/wiki/Nematodes": "The nematodes ( UK : /\u02c8n\u025bm\u0259to\u028adz/ NEM-\u0259-tohdz , US : /\u02c8ni\u02d0m-/ NEEM- Greek : \u039d\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03ce\u03b4\u03b1 ; Latin : Nemat\u00f3da ) or roundworms constitute the phylum Nematoda ( also called Nemathelminthes ) . They are a diverse animal phylum inhabiting a broad range of environments . Taxonomically , they are classified along with insects and other moulting animals in the clade Ecdysozoa , and unlike flatworms , have tubular digestive systems with openings at both ends . Like tardigrades they have a reduced number of Hox genes , but as their sister phylum Nematomorpha has kept the ancestral protostome Hox genotype , it shows that the reduction has occurred within the nematode phylum . Nematode species can be difficult to distinguish from one another . Consequently , estimates of the number of nematode species described to date vary by author and may change rapidly over time . A 2013 survey of animal biodiversity published in the mega journal Zootaxa puts this figure at over 25,000 . Estimates of the total number of extant species are subject to even greater variation . A widely referenced article published in 1993 estimated there may be over 1 million species of nematode , a claim which has since been repeated in numerous publications , without additional investigation , in an attempt to accentuate the importance and ubiquity of nematodes in the global ecosystem ( rather than as a sign of agreement with the estimated taxonomic figure ) . Many other publications have since vigorously refuted this claim on the grounds that it is unsupported by fact , and is the result of speculation and sensationalism . More recent , fact-based estimates have placed the true figure closer to 40,000 species worldwide . Nematodes have successfully adapted to nearly every ecosystem : from marine ( salt ) to fresh water , soils , from the polar regions to the tropics , as well as the highest to the lowest of elevations .",
  "/wiki/Small_Cajal_body-specific_RNA": "Small Cajal body-specific RNAs ( scaRNAs ) are a class of small nucleolar RNAs ( snoRNAs ) that specifically localise to the Cajal body , a nuclear organelle ( cellular sub-organelle ) involved in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( snRNPs or snurps ) . ScaRNAs guide the modification ( methylation and pseudouridylation ) of RNA polymerase II transcribed spliceosomal RNAs U1 , U2 , U4 , U5 and U12 . The first scaRNA identified was U85 . It is unlike typical snoRNAs in that it is a composite C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs and can guide both pseudouridylation and 2'-O-methylation . Not all scaRNAs are composite C/D and H/ACA box snoRNA and most scaRNAs are structurally and functionally indistinguishable from snoRNAs , directing ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) modification in the nucleolus .",
  "/wiki/Guide_RNA": "Guide RNAs ( a.k.a . gRNA , sgRNA ) are the RNAs that guide the insertion or deletion of uridine residues into mitochondrial mRNAs in kinetoplastid protists in a process known as RNA editing . The terms guide RNA and gRNA are also used in prokaryotic DNA editing involving CRISPR and Cas9 . For this prokaryotic DNA-editing system , the gRNA confers target sequence specificity to the CRISPR-Cas9 system . These gRNAs are non coding short RNA sequences which bind to the complementary target DNA sequences . Guide RNA first binds to the Cas9 enzyme and the gRNA sequence guides the complex via pairing to a specific location on the DNA , where Cas9 performs its endonuclease activity by cutting the target DNA strand . In addition to expression of the Cas9 nuclease , the CRISPR-Cas9 system requires a specific RNA molecule to recruit and direct the nuclease activity to the region of interest . These guide RNAs take one of two forms :",
  "/wiki/Kinetoplastida": "Kinetoplastida ( or Kinetoplastea , as a class ) is a group of flagellated protists belonging to the phylum Euglenozoa , and characterised by the presence of an organelle with a large massed DNA called kinetoplast ( hence the name ) . The organisms are commonly referred to as kinetoplastids or kinetoplasts The group includes a number of parasites responsible for serious diseases in humans and other animals , as well as various forms found in soil and aquatic environments . Their distinguishing feature , the presence of a kinetoplast , is an unusual DNA-containing granule located within the single mitochondrion associated with the base of the cell 's flagella ( the basal body ) . The kinetoplast contains many copies of the mitochondrial genome . The kinetoplastids were first defined by Bronislaw M. Honigberg in 1963 as the members of the flagellated protozoans . They are traditionally divided into the biflagellate Bodonidae and uniflagellate Trypanosomatidae ; the former appears to be paraphyletic to the latter . One family of kinetoplastids , the trypanosomatids , is notable as it includes several genera which are exclusively parasitic . Bodo is a typical genus within kinetoplastida and including various common free-living species which feed on bacteria . Others include Cryptobia and the parasitic Leishmania .",
  "/wiki/Mitochondria": "The mitochondrion ( /\u02ccm\u028c\u026at\u0259\u02c8k\u0252ndr\u026a\u0259n/ , /-t\u0259\u028a-/ , plural mitochondria ) is a double-membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms . Some cells in some multicellular organisms may , however , lack them ( for example , mature mammalian red blood cells ) . A number of unicellular organisms , such as microsporidia , parabasalids , and diplomonads , have also reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures . To date , only one eukaryote , Monocercomonoides , is known to have completely lost its mitochondria . The word mitochondrion comes from the Greek \u03bc\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 , mitos , thread , and \u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03bd , chondrion , granule or grain-like . Mitochondria generate most of the cell 's supply of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , used as a source of chemical energy . A mitochondrion is thus termed the powerhouse of the cell . Mitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 \u03bcm\u00b2 in area but vary considerably in size and structure . Unless specifically stained , they are not visible . In addition to supplying cellular energy , mitochondria are involved in other tasks , such as signaling , cellular differentiation , and cell death , as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth . Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes . Mitochondria have been implicated in several human diseases , including mitochondrial disorders , cardiac dysfunction , heart failure and autism .",
  "/wiki/RNase_P": "Ribonuclease P ( EC 3.1.26.5 , RNase P ) is a type of ribonuclease which cleaves RNA . RNase P is unique from other RNases in that it is a ribozyme - a ribonucleic acid that acts as a catalyst in the same way that a protein-based enzyme would . Its function is to cleave off an extra , or precursor , sequence of RNA on tRNA molecules . Further , RNase P is one of two known multiple turnover ribozymes in nature ( the other being the ribosome ) , the discovery of which earned Sidney Altman and Thomas Cech the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1989 : in the 1970s , Altman discovered the existence of precursor tRNA with flanking sequences and was the first to characterize RNase P and its activity in processing of the 5 ' leader sequence of precursor tRNA . Recent findings also reveal that RNase P has a new function . It has been shown that human nuclear RNase P is required for the normal and efficient transcription of various small noncoding RNAs , such as tRNA , 5S rRNA , SRP RNA and U6 snRNA genes , which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III , one of three major nuclear RNA polymerases in human cells .",
  "/wiki/RNase_MRP": "RNase MRP ( also called RMRP ) is an enzymatically active ribonucleoprotein with two distinct roles in eukaryotes . RNAse MRP stands for RNAse for mitochondrial RNA processing . In mitochondria it plays a direct role in the initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication . In the nucleus it is involved in precursor rRNA processing , where it cleaves the internal transcribed spacer 1 between 18S and 5.8S rRNAs . Despite distinct functions , RNase MRP has been shown to be evolutionarily related to RNase P. Like eukaryotic RNase P , RNase MRP is not catalytically active without associated protein subunits . Mutations in the RNA component of RNase MRP cause cartilage-hair hypoplasia , a pleiotropic human disease . Responsible for this disease is a mutation in the RNase MRP RNA gene ( RMRP ) , a non-coding RNA gene . RMRP was the first non-coding nuclear RNA gene found to cause disease .",
  "/wiki/DNA_replication": "In molecular biology , DNA replication is the biological process of producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original DNA molecule . DNA replication occurs in all living organisms acting as the basis for biological inheritance . The cell possesses the distinctive property of division , which makes replication of DNA essential . DNA is made up of a double helix of two complementary strands . During replication , these strands are separated . Each strand of the original DNA molecule then serves as a template for the production of its counterpart , a process referred to as semiconservative replication . As a result of semi-conservative replication , the new helix will be composed of an original DNA strand as well as a newly synthesized strand . Cellular proofreading and error-checking mechanisms ensure near perfect fidelity for DNA replication . In a cell , DNA replication begins at specific locations , or origins of replication , in the genome . Unwinding of DNA at the origin and synthesis of new strands , accommodated by an enzyme known as helicase , results in replication forks growing bi-directionally from the origin . A number of proteins are associated with the replication fork to help in the initiation and continuation of DNA synthesis . Most prominently , DNA polymerase synthesizes the new strands by adding nucleotides that complement each ( template ) strand .",

  "/wiki/Animal": "Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia . With few exceptions , animals consume organic material , breathe oxygen , are able to move , can reproduce sexually , and grow from a hollow sphere of cells , the blastula , during embryonic development . Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described - of which around 1 million are insects - but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total . Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres ( 110 ft ) . They have complex interactions with each other and their environments , forming intricate food webs . The kingdom Animalia includes humans , but in colloquial use the term animal often refers only to non-human animals . The scientific study of animals is known as zoology . Most living animal species are in the Bilateria , a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan . The Bilateria include the protostomes - in which many groups of invertebrates are found , such as nematodes , arthropods , and molluscs - and the deuterostomes , containing both the echinoderms as well as the chordates , the latter containing the vertebrates . Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian . Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion , which began around 542 million years ago . 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified ; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago .",
  "/wiki/Telomerase_RNA": "Telomerase RNA component , also known as TR , TER or TERC , is an ncRNA found in eukaryotes that is a component of telomerase , the enzyme used to extend telomeres . TERC serves as a template for telomere replication ( reverse transcription ) by telomerase . Telomerase RNAs differ greatly in sequence and structure between vertebrates , ciliates and yeasts , but they share a 5 ' pseudoknot structure close to the template sequence . The vertebrate telomerase RNAs have a 3 ' H/ACA snoRNA-like domain .",
  "/wiki/Telomere": "A telomere ( /\u02c8t\u025bl\u0259m\u026a\u0259r/ or /\u02c8t\u026al\u0259m\u026a\u0259r/ ) is a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromosome , which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes . Its name is derived from the Greek nouns telos ( \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ) end and mer\u03bfs ( \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 , root : \u03bc\u03b5\u03c1- ) part . For vertebrates , the sequence of nucleotides in telomeres is AGGGTT , with the complementary DNA strand being TCCCAA , with a single-stranded TTAGGG overhang . This sequence of TTAGGG is repeated approximately 2,500 times in humans . In humans , average telomere length declines from about 11 kilobases at birth to fewer than 4 kilobases in old age , with the average rate of decline being greater in men than in women . During chromosome replication , the enzymes that duplicate DNA can not continue their duplication all the way to the end of a chromosome , so in each duplication the end of the chromosome is shortened ( this is because the synthesis of Okazaki fragments requires RNA primers attaching ahead on the lagging strand ) . The telomeres are disposable buffers at the ends of chromosomes which are truncated during cell division ; their presence protects the genes before them on the chromosome from being truncated instead . The telomeres themselves are protected by a complex of shelterin proteins , as well as by the RNA that telomeric DNA encodes ( TERRA ) . Over time , due to each cell division , the telomere ends become shorter . They are replenished by an enzyme , telomerase reverse transcriptase .",

The SL1 RNA is involved in trans-splicing , which is a form of RNA processing . The acquisition of a spliced leader from an SL RNA is an inter-molecular reaction that precisely joins exons derived from separately transcribed RNAs . This mechanism of mRNA maturation has been shown to occur in a number of lower eukaryotes and is commonplace in nematodes ."
