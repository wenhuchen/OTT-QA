Established in 1947 as an alternative to the Edinburgh International Festival , it takes place annually in Edinburgh , Scotland , in the month of August . The Edinburgh Festival Fringe has become a world-leading celebration of arts and culture , surpassed only by the Olympics in terms of global ticketed events . As an event it has done more to place Edinburgh in the forefront of world cities than anything else . It is an open access ( or unjuried ) performing arts festival , meaning there is no selection committee , and anyone may participate , with any type of performance . The official Fringe Programme categorises shows into sections for theatre , comedy , dance , physical theatre , circus , cabaret , children 's shows , musicals , opera , music , spoken word , exhibitions and events . Comedy is the largest section , making up over one-third of the programme and the one that in modern times has the highest public profile , due in part to the Edinburgh Comedy Awards . The Festival is supported by the Festival Fringe Society , which publishes the programme , sells tickets to all events from a central physical box office and website , and offers year-round advice and support to performers . The Society 's permanent location is at the Fringe Shop on the Royal Mile , and in August they also manage Fringe Central , a separate collection of spaces in Appleton Tower and other University of Edinburgh buildings , dedicated to providing support for Fringe participants during their time at the festival . The Fringe board of directors is drawn from members of the Festival Fringe Society , who are often Fringe participants themselves - performers or administrators . Elections are held once a year , in August , and Board members serve a term of four years . The Board appoints the Fringe Chief Executive ( formerly known as the Fringe Administrator or Director ) , currently Shona McCarthy who assumed the role in March 2016 .",

  "/wiki/Mr_Puntila_and_his_Man_Matti": "Mr Puntila and his Man Matti ( German : Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti ) is an epic comedy by the German modernist playwright Bertolt Brecht . It was written in 1940 and first performed in 1948 . The story describes the aristocratic land-owner Puntila 's relationship to his servant , Matti , as well as his daughter , Eva , who he wants to marry off to an Attach\u00e9 . Eva herself loves Matti and so Puntila has to decide whether to marry his daughter to his driver or to an Attach\u00e9 , while he also deals with a drinking problem . In his essay Notes on the Folk Play ( written in 1940 ) , Brecht warns that naturalistic acting is not enough in this case and recommends an approach to staging that draws on the Commedia dell'Arte . The central relationship between Mr Puntila and Matti - in which Puntila is warm , friendly and loving when drunk , but cold , cynical and penny-pinching when sober - echoes the relationship between the Tramp and the Millionaire in Charlie Chaplin 's City Lights ( 1931 ) . The duality of Mr. Puntila is an example of Brecht 's use of the literary device , the split character . The play is also an inspiration for some of the main characters in Vishal Bhardwaj 's Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola .",
