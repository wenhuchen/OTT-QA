In particular , it features a hierarchy of source repositories , and allows atomic updates of multiple files , features found in later version-control systems such as Subversion and Perforce . TeamWare allows distributed development by copying a repository to another which might reside on another machine or network . Developers can then commit changes to the local copy of the repository , periodically integrating accumulated changes in the local repository back into the original repository . TeamWare is implemented as a layer over the older SCCS , which is used to track changes to individual files .

Nokia is a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry , having assisted in the development of the GSM , 3G and LTE standards ( and currently in 5G ) , and was once the largest worldwide vendor of mobile phones and smartphones . After a partnership with Microsoft and subsequent market struggles , its mobile phone business was bought by Microsoft , creating Microsoft Mobile as its successor in 2014 . After the sale , Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business and on Internet of things technologies , marked by the divestiture of its Here mapping division and the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent , including its Bell Labs research organization . The company then also experimented with virtual reality and digital health , the latter through the purchase of Withings .",
  "/wiki/Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication": "The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ( SWIFT ) , legally S.W.I.F.T . SCRL , provides a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure , standardized and reliable environment . SWIFT also sells software and services to financial institutions , much of it for use on the SWIFTNet network , and ISO 9362. Business Identifier Codes ( BICs , previously Bank Identifier Codes ) are popularly known as SWIFT codes . As of 2018 , around half all high-value cross-border payments worldwide used the SWIFT network . As of 2015 [ update ] , SWIFT linked more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories , who were exchanging an average of over 32 million messages per day ( compared to an average of 2.4 million daily messages in 1995 ) . SWIFT transports financial messages in a highly secure way but does not hold accounts for its members and does not perform any form of clearing or settlement . SWIFT does not facilitate funds transfer : rather , it sends payment orders , which must be settled by correspondent accounts that the institutions have with each other . Each financial institution , to exchange banking transactions , must have a banking relationship by either being a bank or affiliating itself with one ( or more ) so as to enjoy those particular business features . SWIFT has been criticized for its inefficiency , with the Financial Times observing in 2018 that transfers frequently pass through multiple banks before reaching their final destination , making them time-consuming , costly and lacking transparency on how much money will arrive at the other end . At the time its market dominance was described as being challenged by blockchain technology , such as Ripple , although SWIFT argued that the scalability issues of blockchain solutions remained unsolved , confining them to bilateral and intra-bank applications . SWIFT has introduced its own improved service , called Global Payments Innovation ( GPI ) , stating that as of 2018 it had been adopted by 165 banks , and was completing half of its payments in under 30 minutes . SWIFT is a cooperative society under Belgian law owned by its member financial institutions with offices around the world .",

While the adoption of the Linux kernel in desktop computer operating system is low , Linux-based operating systems dominate nearly every other segment of computing , from mobile devices to mainframes . Since November 2017 [ update ] , all of the world 's 500 most powerful supercomputers run Linux . The Android operating system for tablet computers , smartphones , and smartwatches also uses the Linux kernel . The Linux kernel was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his personal computer and with no cross-platform intentions , but has since expanded to support a huge array of computer architectures , many more than other kernels do . Linux rapidly attracted developers and users who adopted it as the kernel for other free software projects , notably the GNU Operating System , which was created as a free , non-proprietary operating system , and based on UNIX as a by-product of the fallout of the Unix wars . The Linux kernel API , the application programming interface ( API ) through which user programs interact with the kernel , is meant to be very stable and to not break userspace programs ( some programs , such as those with GUIs , rely on other APIs as well ) . As part of the kernel 's functionality , device drivers control the hardware ; mainlined ( included in the kernel ) device drivers are also meant to be very stable . However , the interface between the kernel and loadable kernel modules ( LKMs ) , unlike in many other kernels and operating systems , is not meant to be very stable by design .

Though Perl is not officially an acronym , there are various backronyms in use , including Practical Extraction and Reporting Language . Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier . Since then , it has undergone many changes and revisions . Raku , which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000 , eventually evolved into a separate language . Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another . The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C , shell script ( sh ) , AWK , and sed ; Wall also alludes to BASIC and Lisp in the introduction to Learning Perl ( Schwartz & Christiansen ) and so on . They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools , facilitating manipulation of text files . Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language , in part due to its unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities .

The build system is based on BitBake recipes , which specify how a particular package is built , but also includes lists of dependencies and source code locations , as well as instructions on how to install and remove a compiled package . OpenEmbedded tools use these recipes to fetch and patch source code , compile and link binaries , produce binary packages ( ipk , deb , rpm ) , and create bootable images . Historically , OpenEmbedded 's collection of recipes were stored in a single repository , and the metadata was structured in a form now called OpenEmbedded-Classic . By 2010 , it had become increasingly difficult to manage the ever-growing number of recipes . To resolve this , recipe metadata was split into multiple layers . The lowest layer , which includes platform-independent and distribution-independent metadata is called OpenEmbedded-Core . Architecture-specific , application-specific and distribution-dependent instructions are applied in appropriate target support layers that can override or complement the instructions from lower layers . Additionally , changes to the recipes at the core layer are now managed with a pull model : instead of committing their changes directly to the repository ( as was previously the case ) , developers now send their patches to the mailing list .

All basic configurations are controlled by text files , including the construction of menus and the mapping of key-bindings . Fluxbox has high compliance to the Extended Window Manager Hints specification . Fluxbox is basic in appearance , but it can show a few options for improved attractiveness : colors , gradients , borders , and several other basic appearance attributes can be specified . Recent versions support rounded corners and graphical elements . Effects managers such as xcompmgr , cairo-compmgr and transset-df ( deprecated ) can add true transparency to desktop elements and windows . Enhancements can also be provided by using iDesk or fbdesk , SpaceFM , PCMan_File_Manager or the ROX Desktop . Fluxbox also has several features Blackbox lacks , including tabbed windows and a configurable titlebar . Because of its small memory footprint and quick loading time , Fluxbox is popular in many Live CDs such as GParted . It was the default window manager of Damn Small Linux and antiX , but was replaced with JWM in 2007 and 2009 respectively . It is currently the default window manager of PCFluxboxOS , a remaster of PCLinuxOS , and of Linux Mint Fluxbox CE .",

Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin , having 3 to 4 times more usage than any other JavaScript library . jQuery 's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document , select DOM elements , create animations , handle events , and develop Ajax applications . jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library . This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation , advanced effects and high-level , themeable widgets . The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications . The set of jQuery core features - DOM element selections , traversal and manipulation - enabled by its selector engine ( named Sizzle from v1.3 ) , created a new programming style , fusing algorithms and DOM data structures . This style influenced the architecture of other JavaScript frameworks like YUI v3 and Dojo , later stimulating the creation of the standard Selectors API .

The library is internally written in C and possibly , depending on the target platform , C++ or Objective-C , and provides the application programming interface in C , with bindings to other languages available . It is free and open-source software subject to the requirements of the zlib License since version 2.0 , and with prior versions subject to the GNU Lesser General Public License . Under the zlib License , SDL 2.0 is freely available for static linking in closed-source projects , unlike SDL 1.2 . SDL is extensively used in the industry in both large and small projects . Over 700 games , 180 applications , and 120 demos have been posted on the library website .",

  "/wiki/I2P": "The Invisible Internet Project ( I2P ) is an anonymous network layer ( implemented as a Mix Network ) that allows for censorship-resistant , peer to peer communication . Anonymous connections are achieved by encrypting the user 's traffic ( by using end-to-end encryption ) , and sending it through a volunteer-run network of roughly 55,000 computers distributed around the world . Given the high number of possible paths the traffic can transit , a third party watching a full connection is unlikely . The software that implements this layer is called an I2P router , and a computer running I2P is called an I2P node . I2P is free and open source , and is published under multiple licenses .",

  "/wiki/FreeBSD": "FreeBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , which was based on Research Unix . The first version of FreeBSD was released in 1993 . In 2005 , FreeBSD was the most popular open-source BSD operating system , accounting for more than three-quarters of all installed BSD systems . FreeBSD has similarities with Linux , with two major differences in scope and licensing : FreeBSD maintains a complete system , i.e . the project delivers a kernel , device drivers , userland utilities , and documentation , as opposed to Linux only delivering a kernel and drivers , and relying on third-parties for system software ; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a permissive BSD license , as opposed to the copyleft GPL used by Linux . The FreeBSD project includes a security team overseeing all software shipped in the base distribution . A wide range of additional third-party applications may be installed using the pkg package management system or FreeBSD Ports , or by compiling source code . Due to its licensing , much of FreeBSD 's codebase has become an integral part of other operating systems , such as Apple 's Darwin ( the basis for macOS , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS ) , FreeNAS ( an open-source NAS/SAN operating system ) , and the system software for Sony 's PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 .",
