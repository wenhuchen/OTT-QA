  "/wiki/PlayStation_Vita": "The PlayStation Vita ( also known as the PS Vita or simply Vita ) is a handheld video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment . It was first released in Japan on December 17 , 2011 , and in North America , Europe , and other international territories beginning on February 22 , 2012 . The console is the successor to the PlayStation Portable , and a part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices ; as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles , it primarily competed with the Nintendo 3DS . The original model of the handheld includes a 5-inch ( 130 mm ) OLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen , two analog joysticks , and front and shoulder push-button input , and supports Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , and optional 3G . Internally , the Vita features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a quad-core SGX543MP graphics processing unit . The PS Vita 2000 series , a revised version of the system , was released across 2013 and 2014 , sports all of the same features with a slightly smaller size , extended battery life , and an LCD screen replacing the OLED display . Sony also released the PlayStation TV , a short-lived , re-purposed version of the Vita that allowed for the play of PS Vita games on a television screen similar to a home video game console , though the PS TV variant was discontinued by the end of 2015 . The system 's design was created to meld the experience of big budget , dedicated video game platforms with the then up-and-coming trend of mobile gaming through smart phones and tablets . However , in the year after the device 's successful launch , sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled , threatening to end its lifespan . A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West , combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies , helped keep the platform afloat . While this led to less diversity in its game library , it did garner strong support in JRPGs and visual novels , alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games , leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan , and build a smaller , yet passionate userbase in the West . While Sony has not released exact sales figures , late-lifespan estimates in sales fall around 15 to 16 million units .",

The player is given access to a flowchart , which allows them to revisit any previously completed section , and choose a different option to cause the story to proceed in another direction . The game was developed as a result of the unexpected critical success that its predecessor , Nine Hours , Nine Persons , Nine Doors , received in North America . Game director Kotaro Uchikoshi wrote the script , which was then localized by Aksys Games and Rising Star Games for North America and Europe respectively . Virtue 's Last Reward was released to positive reviews . Critics praised the story and characters but were divided in their opinions of the Escape sections . Despite positive reviews , the game was a commercial failure in Japan , which led to the temporary cancellation of its sequel . Development on the sequel eventually resumed , and Zero Time Dilemma was released in 2016 .",

The game was published in 2009 by Marvelous Entertainment ( Japan ) , Ignition Entertainment ( North America ) , and Rising Star Games ( Europe ) . The Vita version was published in 2013 by Marvelous AQL in Japan and Aksys Games in Western territories . Using a 2D side-scrolling perspective , the gameplay revolves around a beat 'em up fighting system , while incorporating role-playing elements such as leveling and questing . Muramasa takes place during the Edo period on Japan 's main island of Honshu . Due to ruling sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi 's thirst for power , conflicts have arisen over ownership of the Demon Blades , samurai swords that force their wielders to kill others before bringing tragedy and madness upon them . The story revolves around two different protagonists related to this conflict - Momohime , a woman who is possessed by the spirit of vengeful r\u014dnin Jinkuro Izuna ; and Kisuke , an amnesiac ninja on the run for a forgotten crime who is tied up with the tragedy that destroyed Momohime 's family . The Vita port includes four self-contained stories based on Japanese folklore released under the banner title Genroku Legends ( \u5143\u7984\u602a\u5947\u8b5a , Genroku Kaikitan ) . The concept work for Muramasa began during the middle of development on Odin Sphere . Along with improving on the action gameplay over Odin Sphere , a great deal of effort was put into making the game 's setting authentic to the period . Kamitani created the story based on kabuki theatre , incorporating Japanese folklore and Buddhist theology .
