  "/wiki/Exclusive_Brethren": "The Exclusive Brethren are a subset of the Christian evangelical movement generally described as the Plymouth Brethren . They are distinguished from the Open Brethren from whom they separated in 1848 . The Exclusive Brethren are now divided into a number of groups , most of which differ on minor points of doctrine or practice . Perhaps the best-known of these , mainly through media attention , is the Raven-Taylor-Hales group , now known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church , which maintains the doctrine of uncompromising separation from the world based on their interpretation of 2 Corinthians 6 and 2 Timothy 2 , believing that attendance at the Communion Service , the 'Lord 's Supper ' , governs and strictly limits their relationship with others , even other Brethren groups . These brethren have one fellowship in some nineteen countries - including France , Germany , Spain , Italy , Denmark , the Netherlands , Switzerland , Sweden , Egypt , and Argentina , but they are more numerous in Australia , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , and North America where they are referred to just as the Exclusive Brethren or Brethren .",
