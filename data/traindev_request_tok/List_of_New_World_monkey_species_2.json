  "/wiki/Panamanian_night_monkey": "The Panamanian night monkey or Chocoan night monkey ( Aotus zonalis ) is a species of night monkey formerly considered a subspecies of the gray-bellied night monkey of the family Aotidae . Its range consists of Panama and the Choc\u00f3 region of Colombia . There are also unconfirmed reports of its occurrence in Costa Rica , especially on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica . The species definitely occurs in the Atlantic lowlands of Panama close to the Costa Rica border . The exact classification of the Panamanian Night Monkey is uncertain . While some authors consider it a subspecies of the gray-bellied night monkey , A. lemurinus , other authors follow a study by Thomas Defler from 2001 , which concluded that it is a separate species , A. zonalis . The Panamanian night monkey is a relatively small monkey , with males weighing approximately 889 grams ( 31.4 oz ) and females weighing about 916 grams ( 32.3 oz ) . The fur on the back ranges from grayish brown to reddish brown . The belly is yellow . The hair on the back of the hands and feet is black or dark brown , which is a key distinguishing feature from other northern gray-necked Aotus species ; also , its hair is shorter . Other distinguishing features relate to its skull , which has a broad braincase , a depressed interorbital region , and large molariform teeth . Like other night monkeys , the Panamanian night monkey has large eyes , befitting its nocturnal lifestyle .",

  "/wiki/Thomas_Defler": "Thomas R. Defler ( born 26 November 1941 ; Denver , Colorado ) is a North American primatologist who lives and works in Colombia . He earned his PhD from the University of Colorado at Denver in 1976 and then he moved to Colombia . Defler worked in eastern Colombia , in the Llanos until 1984 and then in the Amazonian Vaup\u00e9s Department where he developed and lived in his research station , Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica Capar\u00fa until 1998 when he was obligated to flee from his research station by FARC guerrillas . He had run a primate rehabilitation center in Vaupes . He is the author of many papers about primates and of the books Primates de Colombia ( 2003 ) , Primates of Colombia ( 2004 ) and Historia Natural de los Primates Colombianos ( 2010 ) . He also edited a monograph on woolly monkeys . Currently , he heads another Amazonian research station that he has developed in the southern Colombian Amazon , Estaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica Om\u00e9 , that is affiliated with the National University of Colombia and he teaches at the Bogot\u00e1 campus of the same university . He and the Colombian biologist Marta Bueno are credited with first describing Hern\u00e1ndez-Camacho 's night monkey ( Aotus jorgehernandezi ) in 2007 . Together with Javier Garcia , he led an expedition in which they discovered and described a new species of titi monkey , the Caquet\u00e1 titi ( Callicebus caquetensis ) . Using karyotypes , Defler has done work clarifying the taxonomy of various species of night monkey ( Aotus ) . He has done field studies in the Colombian llanos and the Colombian Amazon on the white-fronted capuchin ( Cebus albifrons ) , the brown woolly monkey ( Lagothrix lagothricha ) , the black-headed uakari ( Cacajao melanocephalus ) , the black titi ( Callicebus lugens ) , the Lucifer titi ( Callicebus lucifer ) , and the Venezuelan red howler ( Alouatta seniculus ) and has accomplished many primate censuses in different parts of eastern Colombia .",

  "/wiki/Three-striped_night_monkey": "The three-striped night monkey ( Aotus trivirgatus ) , also known as northern night monkey or northern owl monkey , is one of several species of owl monkeys currently recognised . It is found in Venezuela and north-central Brazil . Until 1983 , all the owl monkeys were regarded as subspecies of Aotus trivirgatus , and all were referred to as douroucoulis . The use of the name douroucouli exclusively for the three-striped night monkey is not universally accepted ; some authors use it for the entire genus , or for the grey-necked group of species within it ( to which A. trivirgatus belongs ) . Like other owl monkeys , the three-striped night monkey lives in woodlands including rain forest . It is mainly black , with striking white markings on its face . Its body size is 27-48 cm , and its tail is about the same length again . Adults weigh up to 1 kg . It has very large eyes , and is most active on moonlit nights , feeding on fruit , nuts , leaves , insects and other small invertebrates , and birds ' eggs . The three-striped night monkey forms pair bonds which are broken only by the death of one partner . It lives in family groups , with the immature young staying with their parents until sexual maturity at the age of 3 or 4 . Normally only one infant is born , after a gestation period of a little over 4 months .",

  "/wiki/Spix's_night_monkey": "Spix 's night monkey ( Aotus vociferans ) is a night monkey species from South America . It is found in Brazil , Colombia , Ecuador and Peru . The Spix 's night monkey is a small bodied monkey species usually having a mass of around one kilogram . It belongs to the only nocturnal genus of New World primates Aotus . This type of monkey can leap farther than most due to it having longer arms than legs . The monkey averages 0.5 meters in height . The night monkey is considered to be a new world monkey . The social behavior of the Aotus vociferans is group based . These groups usually consist of breeding pairs and their offspring . This species has a monogamous mating system . After the offspring are born , the father becomes the main caretaker , only giving up the offspring for them to suckle . The offspring will usually stay with their birth group until they reach two and a half to three and a half years old .",
  "/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt": "Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt ( 14 September 1769 - 6 May 1859 ) was a Prussian polymath , geographer , naturalist , explorer , and proponent of Romantic philosophy and science . He was the younger brother of the Prussian minister , philosopher , and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt ( 1767-1835 ) . Humboldt 's quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography . Humboldt 's advocacy of long-term systematic geophysical measurement laid the foundation for modern geomagnetic and meteorological monitoring . Between 1799 and 1804 , Humboldt travelled extensively in the Americas , exploring and describing them for the first time from a modern scientific point of view . His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years . Humboldt was one of the first people to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined ( South America and Africa in particular ) . Humboldt resurrected the use of the word cosmos from the ancient Greek and assigned it to his multivolume treatise , Kosmos , in which he sought to unify diverse branches of scientific knowledge and culture . This important work also motivated a holistic perception of the universe as one interacting entity . He was the first person to describe the phenomenon and cause of human-induced climate change , in 1800 and again in 1831 , based on observations generated during his travels .",
  "/wiki/Peruvian_night_monkey": "The Peruvian night monkey ( Aotus miconax ) , also known as the Andean night monkey , is a nocturnal New World monkey endemic to northern Peru .
