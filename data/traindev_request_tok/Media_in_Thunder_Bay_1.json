  "/wiki/Public_broadcasting": "Public broadcasting involves radio , television and other electronic-media outlets whose primary mission is public service . In many countries of the world , funding comes from governments , especially via annual fees charged on receivers . In the United States , public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources , but generally most of their financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses ( ranging from small shops to corporations ) , along with audience contributions via pledge drives . The great majority operate as private not-for-profit corporations . [ citation needed ] Public broadcasting may be nationally or locally operated , depending on the country and the station . In some countries a single organization runs public broadcasting . Other countries have multiple public-broadcasting organizations operating regionally or in different languages . Historically , public broadcasting was once the dominant or only form of broadcasting in many countries ( with the notable exception of the United States ) . Commercial broadcasting now also exists in most of these countries ; the number of countries with only public broadcasting declined substantially during the latter part of the 20th century .

  "/wiki/News": "News is information about current events . This may be provided through many different media : word of mouth , printing , postal systems , broadcasting , electronic communication , or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events . Common topics for news reports include war , government , politics , education , health , the environment , economy , business , fashion , and entertainment , as well as athletic events , quirky or unusual events . Government proclamations , concerning royal ceremonies , laws , taxes , public health , and criminals , have been dubbed news since ancient times . Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news , which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information . Technological and social developments , often driven by government communication and espionage networks , have increased the speed with which news can spread , as well as influenced its content . The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the newspaper , which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread , with paper and printing press , to Europe .",
  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further . Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as TuneIn , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm .",

The English- and French-language service units of the corporation are commonly known as CBC and Radio-Canada , respectively . Although some local stations in Canada predate the CBC 's founding , CBC is the oldest existing broadcasting network in Canada . The CBC was established on November 2 , 1936 . The CBC operates four terrestrial radio networks : The English-Language CBC Radio One and CBC Music , and the French-Language Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re and Ici Musique .

CBC/Radio-Canada offers programming in English , French and eight aboriginal languages on its domestic radio service , and in five languages on its web-based international radio service , Radio Canada International ( RCI ) . However , budget cuts in the early 2010s have contributed to the corporation reducing its service via the airwaves , discontinuing RCI 's shortwave broadcasts as well as terrestrial television broadcasts in all communities served by network-owned rebroadcast transmitters , including communities not subject to Canada 's over-the-air digital television transition .

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere . In 2015 , approximately 40% of the francophone population ( including L2 and partial speakers ) lived in Europe , 35% in sub-Saharan Africa , 15% in North Africa and the Middle East , 8% in the Americas , and 1% in Asia and Oceania . French is the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union . Of Europeans who speak other languages natively , approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language .",
  "/wiki/Greater_Sudbury": "Sudbury , officially Greater Sudbury ( French : Grand-Sudbury ) , is a city in Ontario , Canada . It is the largest city in Northern Ontario by population , with a population of 161,531 at the 2016 Canadian Census . By land area , it is the largest in Ontario and the fifth largest in Canada . It is administratively a Unitary authority , and thus not part of any district , county , or regional municipality . The Sudbury region was inhabited by the Ojibwe people of the Algonquin group for thousands of years prior to the founding of Sudbury following the discovery of nickel ore in 1883 during the construction of the transcontinental railway . Greater Sudbury was formed in 2001 by merging the cities and towns of the former Regional Municipality of Sudbury with several previously unincorporated townships . Being located inland , the local climate is extremely seasonal with average January lows of around \u221218 \u00b0C ( 0 \u00b0F ) and average July highs of 25 \u00b0C ( 77 \u00b0F ) . The population resides in an urban core and many smaller communities scattered around 330 lakes and among hills of rock blackened by historical smelting activity . Sudbury was once a major lumber centre and a world leader in nickel mining . Mining and related industries dominated the economy for much of the 20th century . The two major mining companies which shaped the history of Sudbury were Inco , now Vale Limited , which employed more than 25% of the population by the 1970s , and Falconbridge , now Glencore . Sudbury has since expanded from its resource-based economy to emerge as the major retail , economic , health and educational centre for Northeastern Ontario .",

  "/wiki/Adult_contemporary": "In North American music , adult contemporary music ( AC ) is a form of radio-played popular music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart .",

Those in the Arctic area are distinct and known as Inuit . The M\u00e9tis , another distinct ethnicity , developed after European contact and relations primarily between First Nations people and Europeans . There are 634 recognized First Nations governments or bands spread across Canada , roughly half of which are in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia . Under Charter Jurisprudence , First Nations are a designated group , along with women , visible minorities , and people with physical or mental disabilities . First Nations are not defined as a visible minority by the criteria of Statistics Canada . North American indigenous peoples have cultures spanning thousands of years . Some of their oral traditions accurately describe historical events , such as the Cascadia earthquake of 1700 and the 18th-century Tseax Cone eruption . Written records began with the arrival of European explorers and colonists during the Age of Discovery , beginning in the late 15th century . European accounts by trappers , traders , explorers , and missionaries give important evidence of early contact culture . In addition , archeological and anthropological research , as well as linguistics , have helped scholars piece together an understanding of ancient cultures and historic peoples . Although not without conflict , early Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cers ' , Acadians ' , and Newfoundlanders ' interactions with First Nations , M\u00e9tis , and Inuit populations were less combative compared to the often violent battles between colonists and native peoples in the United States .",

In 2003 , the station 's owners , Big Pond Communications , applied to the CRTC to increase the station 's signal to 15,000 watts , on the grounds that with a signal that could not adequately reach some parts of the city , the station was economically not viable . However , the CRTC determined that in the previous year 's BBM ratings , there was no evidence that the station 's audience had geographic gaps in the city . In addition , competing commercial broadcasters noted that the launch of CJUK had significantly affected their own economic stability , and alleged that the station was merely using a back door approach toward winning a protected Class A license . The application was consequently denied . Around 2007 , the station shifted from adult contemporary to hot adult contemporary , giving the AC format to CKPR-FM , which converted from AM 580 . In 2005 , the station was acquired by Newcap . On September 24 , 2006 , Magic morning host Rob Brown died after a short battle with cancer .

  "/wiki/Classic_hits": "Classic hits is a radio format which generally includes songs from the top 40 music charts from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s , with music from the 1980s serving as the core of the format . Music that was popularized by MTV in the early 1980s and the nostalgia behind it is a major driver to the format . It is considered the successor to the oldies format , a collection of top 40 songs from the late 1950s through the late 1970s that was once extremely popular in the United States . The term is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for the adult hits format , which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from all decades to the present with a major focus on 1990s and 2000s rock and alternative songs . In addition , adult hits stations tend to have larger playlists , playing a given song only a few times per week , compared to the tighter libraries on classic hits stations . For example , KRTH , a classic hits station in Los Angeles , plays power songs up to 30 times a week , which is another differentiator compared to other formats that share songs with classic hits libraries . The classic hits format has become extremely popular in the last few years with stations like KRTH , WCBS-FM in New York , and WLS-FM in Chicago having successful ratings with this model . Classic hits was named format of the summer of 2018 by Nielsen Audio 's research team emphasizing the huge popularity of the format . In addition , the Millennial generation is listening to this format in record numbers , according to a Nielsen report .

Sometimes campus radio stations are operated for the purpose of training professional radio personnel , sometimes with the aim of broadcasting educational programming , while other radio stations exist to provide alternative to commercial broadcasting or government broadcasters . Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists . Campus radio supported U2 and REM Many campus radio stations carry a variety of programming including news ( often local ) , sports ( often relating to the campus ) , and spoken word programming as well as general music . Often the radio format is best described as a freeform , with a lot of creativity and individualism among the disc jockeys and show hosts . A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet . Although the term campus radio implies full-power AM or FM transmission over the air , many radio stations experiment with low-power broadcasting , closed circuit or carrier current systems , often to on-campus listeners only .

Its popularized roots originate in the Southern United States of the early 1920s . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and/or blue-collar American life , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional English ballads , cowboy songs , and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants ."
