  "/wiki/Afrikaner": "Afrikaners ( Afrikaans : [ afr\u0259\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0n\u0259rs , afri- ] ) are a Southern African ethnic group descended from predominantly Dutch settlers first arriving at the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th and 18th centuries . They traditionally dominated South Africa 's politics and commercial agricultural sector prior to 1994 . Afrikaans , South Africa 's third most widely spoken home language , evolved as the mother tongue of Afrikaners and most Cape Coloureds . It originated from the Dutch vernacular of South Holland , incorporating words brought from the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) and Madagascar by slaves . Afrikaners make up approximately 5.2% of the total South African population based on the number of white South Africans who speak Afrikaans as a first language in the South African National Census of 2011 . The arrival of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama at Calicut in 1498 opened a gateway of free access to Asia from Western Europe around the Cape of Good Hope ; however , it also necessitated the founding and safeguarding of trade stations in the East . The Portuguese landed in Mossel Bay in 1500 , explored Table Bay two years later , and by 1510 had started raiding inland . Shortly afterwards the Dutch Republic sent merchant vessels to India , and in 1602 founded the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie ( Dutch East India Company ; VOC ) . As the volume of traffic rounding the Cape increased , the Company recognised its natural harbour as an ideal watering point for the long voyage around Africa to the Orient and established a victualling station there in 1652 . VOC officials did not favour the permanent settlement of Europeans in their trading empire , although during the 140 years of Dutch rule many VOC servants retired or were discharged and remained as private citizens . Furthermore , the exigencies of supplying local garrisons and passing fleets compelled the administration to confer free status upon employees and oblige them to become independent farmers . Encouraged by the success of this experiment , the Company extended free passage from 1685 to 1707 for Hollanders wishing to settle at the Cape .",

It evolved from the Dutch vernacular of Holland ( Hollandic dialect ) spoken by the largely Dutch settlers ( and then by the native Africans who associated with them ) in the south-west of what is now South Africa , where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century . Hence , it is a daughter language of Dutch . Although Afrikaans has adopted words from other languages , including German and the Khoisan languages , an estimated 90 to 95% of the vocabulary of Afrikaans is of Dutch origin . [ note 1 ] Therefore , differences with Dutch often lie in the more analytic-type morphology and grammar of Afrikaans , and a spelling that expresses Afrikaans pronunciation rather than standard Dutch . There is a large degree of mutual intelligibility between the two languages - especially in written form . With about 7 million native speakers in South Africa , or 13.5% of the population , it is the third-most-spoken language in the country . Estimates of the total number of Afrikaans speakers range between 15 and 23 million . [ note 2 ] It has the widest geographical and racial distribution of all the 11 official languages of South Africa , and is widely spoken and understood as a second or third language .

( A few other tribes in the Northern , Luapula and Copperbelt provinces of Zambia speak languages that are similar to Bemba but are not the same ( E.g . Lamba , Mambwe , Bisa etc. ) . Bemba history is a major historical phenomenon in the development of chieftainship in a large and culturally homogeneous region of central Africa . The Bemba are those who consider themselves subjects of the Chitimukulu , the Bemba 's single paramount chief . They lived in villages of 100 to 200 people and numbered 250,000 strong in 1963 . There are over 30 Bemba clans , named after animals or natural organisms , such as the royal clan , the people of the crocodile ( Bena Ng'andu ) or the Bena Bowa ( Mushroom Clan ) . They were the people who finally put a halt to the northward march of the Nguni and Sotho-Tswana descended Ngoni people , through Chief Chileshe Chitapankwa Muluba . The BaShimba Leopard Clan or bena Ngo living among the Bemba people are part of the Basimba people now living in Tanzania , Uganda and the DR Congo .

  "/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_the_English_language": "Dialects are linguistic varieties which may differ in pronunciation , vocabulary , spelling and grammar . For the classification of varieties of English in terms of pronunciation only , see Regional accents of English . Dialects can be defined as sub-forms of languages which are , in general , mutually comprehensible . English speakers from different countries and regions use a variety of different accents ( systems of pronunciation ) , as well as various localized words and grammatical constructions ; many different dialects can be identified based on these factors . Dialects can be classified at broader or narrower levels : within a broad national or regional dialect , various more localized sub-dialects can be identified , and so on . The combination of differences in pronunciation and use of local words may make some English dialects almost unintelligible to speakers from other regions . The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into three general categories : the British Isles dialects , those of North America , and those of Australasia . Dialects can be associated not only with place , but also with particular social groups . Within a given English-speaking country , there will often be a form of the language considered to be Standard English - the Standard Englishes of different countries differ , and can themselves be considered dialects . Standard English is often associated with the more educated layers of society , as well as more formal registers . British and American English are the reference norms for English as spoken , written , and taught in the rest of the world , excluding countries where English is spoken natively such as Australia , Canada , Ireland and New Zealand . In many former British Empire countries where English is not spoken natively , British English forms are closely followed , alongside numerous AmE usages which have become widespread throughout the English-speaking world .",

They are grouped with the hunter-gatherer San ( literally Foragers ) peoples . The designation Khoekhoe is actually a kare or praise address , not an ethnic endonym , but it has been used in the literature as an ethnic term for Khoe-speaking peoples of Southern Africa , particularly pastoralist groups , such as the ! Ora , ! Gona , Nama , Xiri and \u01c2N\u016bkhoe nations . While it is clear that the presence of Khoekhoen in southern Africa predates the Bantu expansion , it is not certain by how much ( possibly in the Late Stone Age ) . Khoekhoen maintained large herds of Nguni cattle in the Cape region at the time of VOC colonisation in the 17th century . Their nomadic pastoralism was mostly discontinued in the 19th to 20th century . Their Khoekhoe language is related to certain dialects spoken by foraging San peoples of the Kalahari , such as the Khwe and Tshwa , forming the Khoe language family . The main Khoekhoe subdivisions today are the Nama people of Namibia , Botswana and South Africa ( with numerous clans ) , the \u01c2N\u016bkhoen ( so-called Damara or Daman ) of Namibia , the !

They speak the Bantu languages spoken by their geographic neighbours and resemble them physically , but they have some religious practices and beliefs similar to those in Judaism and Islam , which they say were transmitted by oral tradition . The name Lemba may originate in chilemba , a Swahili word for turbans worn by some Bantu peoples , or lembi , a Bantu word meaning non-African or respected foreigner . Magdel le Roux says that the name VaRemba may be translated as the people who refuse - probably in the context of not eating with others ( according to one of her interviewees ) . In Zimbabwe and South Africa , the people prefer the name Mwenye . Since the late twentieth century , there has been increased media and scholarly attention to the Lemba 's claim of common descent to the Jewish people .

  "/wiki/Northern_Ndebele_people": "The Northern Ndebele people ( Northern Ndebele : amaNdebele ) are a Bantu-speaking nation and ethnic group in Southern Africa , who share a common Ndebele culture and Ndebele language ( isiNdebele ) . The Northern Ndebele were historically referred to as the Matabele which derives from the Sesotho expression thebele , indicating people who sheltered behind tall cowhide shields . The term Bathebele was applied to at least two Nguni-speaking groups who settled in the region later called the Transvaal , long before the Mfecane . Although the amaNdebele of Mzilikazi used the much smaller cowhide shields and short stabbing assegai of King Shakas army , they also were called Bathebele , which in isiNguni was rendered as amaNdebele . The history of the Northern Ndebele began when a Nguni group split from King Shaka in the early 19th century under the leadership of Mzilikazi , a former chief in his kingdom and ally . Under his command the disgruntled abaNguni went on to conquer and rule the chiefdoms of the Southern Ndebele . This was where the name and identity of the eventual kingdom was adopted . During a turbulent period in Nguni and Sotho-Tswana history known as the Mfecane or the crushing , Mzilikazis regiment , initially numbering 500 soldiers , moved west towards the present-day city of Pretoria , where they founded a settlement called Mhlahlandlela . The Great Trek in 1838 saw Mzilikazi defeated by the Voortrekkers at Vegkop after which he was exiled into present-day Zimbabwe where the Ndebele overwhelmed the local Lozvi , eventually carving out a home now called Matabeleland and encompassing the west and southwest region of the country . In the course of the migration , large numbers of conquered local clans and individuals were absorbed into the Ndebele nation , adopting the Ndebele language and culture .

Northern Ndebele is related to the Zulu language , spoken in South Africa . This is because the Northern Ndebele people of Zimbabwe descend from followers of the Zulu leader Mzilikazi ( one of Zulu King Shaka 's generals ) , who left the Zulu Kingdom in the early 19th century , during the Mfecane , arriving in present-day Zimbabwe in 1839 . Although there are some differences in grammar , lexicon and intonation between Zulu and Northern Ndebele , the two languages share more than 85% of their lexicon .

In this area , stone tools and rock art paintings date back over 70,000 years and are by far the oldest known art . S\u0101n were traditionally semi-nomadic , moving seasonally within certain defined areas based on the availability of resources such as water , game animals , and edible plants .

  "/wiki/Sotho_language": "Sotho ( /\u02c8su\u02d0tu\u02d0/ ) or Sesotho ( /s\u025b\u02c8su\u02d0tu\u02d0/ ) ( also known as Southern Sotho or Southern Sesotho ) , is a Southern Bantu language of the Sotho-Tswana ( S.30 ) group , spoken primarily by the Basotho in Lesotho , where it is the national and official language , South Africa , where it is one of the 11 official languages and in Zimbabwe where it is one of 16 official languages . Like all Bantu languages , Sesotho is an agglutinative language , which uses numerous affixes and derivational and inflexional rules to build complete words .",
  "/wiki/Swazi_people": "The Swazi ( Swazi : siSwazi ) are a Bantu ethnic group of Southern Africa , predominantly inhabiting modern Eswatini and South Africa 's Mpumalanga province and Mozambique . The Swazi are part of the Nguni family that can be archaeologically traced in East Africa where the same tradition , beliefs and cultural practices are found . The Swazi share a unique experience , culture and Royal lineage . This lineage is exclusive to the inhabitants of Eswatini , even though there have been more Swazi people that have moved to South Africa and the United Kingdom in the 20th century . The original inhabitants of Eswatini no longer reside in Eswatini as a majority population while some remain in the land . The Swazi people and the Kingdom of Eswatini today are named after Mswati II , who became king in 1839 after the death of his father King Sobhuza who strategically defeated the British who occupied Swaziland . The Kingdom of Swaziland was a region occupied by the San people of Southern Africa and the current Swazis came in from North Eastern regions through to Mozambique and eventually Swaziland in the 15th century . Mixtures with the San people and other Nguni tribes occurred . Their royal lineage can be traced to a chief named Dlamini I ; this is still the royal clan name . About three-quarters of the clan groups are Nguni ; the remainder are Sotho , Tsonga , others North East African and San descendants . These groups have intermarried freely . There are slight differences among Swazis as a nation with varying features and skin tones yet Swazi identity extends to all those with allegiance to the twin monarchs Ingwenyama the Lion ( the king ) and Indlovukati the She-Elephant ( the queen mother ) .",
  "/wiki/Swati_language": "The Swazi , Swati or siSwati language ( Swazi : siSwati ) ( pronounced [ siswat\u02bci ] ) is a Bantu language of the Nguni group spoken in Eswatini and South Africa by the Swazi people . The number of speakers is estimated to be in the region of 12 million . The language is taught in Eswatini and some South African schools in Mpumalanga , particularly former KaNgwane areas . Swazi is an official language of Eswatini ( along with English ) , and is also one of the eleven official languages of South Africa . Although the preferred term is siSwati among native speakers , in English it is generally referred to as Swazi . Swazi is most closely related to the other Tekela languages , like Phuthi and Northern Transvaal ( Sumayela ) Ndebele , but is also very close to the Zunda languages : Zulu , Southern Ndebele , Northern Ndebele , and Xhosa .",
  "/wiki/Tonga_people_(Malawi)": "The Tonga ( also called Batonga , Lake Shore Tonga or Nyasa Tonga ) are an ethnic group living in northern Malawi on the shores of Lake Malawi in Nkhata Bay and northern part of Nkhotakota . They are to be distinguished from the Tonga people of Zambia and Zimbabwe , whose language belongs to a different branch of the Bantu family .",
  "/wiki/Tsonga_people": "The Tsonga people ( Tsonga : Vatsonga ) are a Bantu ethnic group native mainly to Southern Mozambique and South Africa ( Northern Transvaal and Eastern Transvaal ) . They speak Xitsonga , a Southern Bantu language which has Nguni influence in particular Swazi and Zulu . The Swazis and the Zulus were the original neighbours of the Tsonga people for more than 1,000 years . Evidence of a very close neighborhood between the Tsonga and the Swazis as well as the Zulus can be seen in similarities in surnames . For example , Mnisi is a surname shared between the Tsonga , Swati and Zulu people . In all these three groups , Mnisi means the one who causes the rain to fall . Tshabalala is another very popular surnames found between the Tsonga , the Swati and the Zulu people . In Tsonga ( Chabalala ) , Swati ( Shabalala ) and Zulu ( Tshabalala ) , again in all these three groups , Tshabalala means Mshengu . A very small number of Tsonga people are also found in Zimbabwe and Northern Swaziland . The Tsonga people of South Africa share some history with the Tsonga people of Southern Mozambique ; however they differ culturally and linguistically from the Tonga people of Zambia and Zimbabwe .",
  "/wiki/Tsonga_language": "Tsonga ( /\u02c8ts\u0252\u014b\u0261\u0259 , \u02c8ts\u0254\u02d0-/ ) or Xitsonga ( Tsonga : Xitsonga ) is a Bantu language spoken by the Tsonga people . It is mutually intelligible with Tswa and Ronga , and the name Tsonga is often used as a cover term for all three , also sometimes referred to as Tswa-Ronga . The Xitsonga language has been standardized for both academic and home use , making it the base language for the Tsonga people . Like with many other languages , there are various dialects within the Tsonga language group ."
