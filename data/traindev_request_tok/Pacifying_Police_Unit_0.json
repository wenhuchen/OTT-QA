  "/wiki/Bairro": "A bairro ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ \u02c8baj\u0281u ] ) is a Portuguese word for a quarter or a neighborhood or , sometimes , a district which is within a city or town . It is commonly used in Brazil , Mozambique , Guinea-Bissau , Portugal , and other Portuguese-speaking places . Bairro is cognate with Germanic berg , burg , borg , burgh , borough etc , and Spanish barrio , all of which descend from the same Proto-Indo European root . In Brazil , the word is frequently applied to urban areas in cities , in which the bairros are generally defined only unofficially and have rough borders , without any official administrative function . In some cities , however , the bairros have defined territorial limits set by the municipal government , but most follow popular definition by its citizens . In Portugal , the word is used with the same meaning as in Brazil , defining a non administrative urban area , frequently without clear borders , an example being the Bairro Alto in Lisbon . Occasionally , a Portuguese bairro can coincide with an administrative freguesia ( civil parish ) . In the past , the cities of Lisbon and Porto were divided in large administrative divisions - each encompassing several freguesias - which were also named bairros . In Mozambique , bairros are administrative subdivisions of urban districts with important functions in the identification of the residents and determine the attributes of the area in regard to construction or agriculture , much like zoning . They are directed by secret\u00e1rios . In Guinea-Bissau , bairros are first the peri-urban quarters of the capital Bissau beyond the old city centre ( Pra\u00e7a ) , e.g . Bairro de Ajuda , Bairro Militar , Pessak , Quelele , Luanda , Mpantcha , and by extension quarters of smaller towns throughout the country .",

Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil 's third-most populous state . Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site , named Rio de Janeiro : Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea , by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape . Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese , the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro , a domain of the Portuguese Empire . Later , in 1763 , it became the capital of the State of Brazil , a state of the Portuguese Empire . In 1808 , when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil , Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal , who subsequently , in 1815 , under the leadership of her son , the Prince Regent , and future King Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal , raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom , within the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil , and Algarves . Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822 , when the War of Brazilian Independence began . This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies . Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy , the Empire of Brazil , until 1889 , and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Bras\u00edlia . Rio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country , and 30th largest in the world in 2008 , estimated at about R $ 343 billion ( nearly US $ 201 billion ) . It is headquarters to Brazilian oil , mining , and telecommunications companies , including two of the country 's major corporations - Petrobras and Vale - and Latin America 's largest telemedia conglomerate , Grupo Globo . The home of many universities and institutes , it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil , accounting for 17% of national scientific output according to 2005 data .",

It is located near S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o and Engenho de Dentro , within the Centro ( Downtown ) Administrative Region .

After the jesuits were expelled from the Portuguese Empire by the marquis of Pombal , in 1759 , possessions in Benfica were granted to various private owners , and the region became further populated .
