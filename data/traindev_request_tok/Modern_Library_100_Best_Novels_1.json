  "/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged": "Atlas Shrugged is a 1957 novel by Ayn Rand . Rand 's fourth and final novel , it was also her longest , and the one she considered to be her magnum opus in the realm of fiction writing . Atlas Shrugged includes elements of science fiction , mystery , and romance , and it contains Rand 's most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction . The book depicts a dystopian United States in which private businesses suffer under increasingly burdensome laws and regulations . Railroad executive Dagny Taggart and her lover , steel magnate Hank Rearden , struggle against looters who want to exploit their productivity . Dagny and Hank discover that a mysterious figure called John Galt is persuading other business leaders to abandon their companies and disappear as a strike of productive individuals against the looters . The novel ends with the strikers planning to build a new capitalist society based on Galt 's philosophy of reason and individualism . The theme of Atlas Shrugged , as Rand described it , is the role of man 's mind in existence . The book explores a number of philosophical themes from which Rand would subsequently develop Objectivism . In doing so , it expresses the advocacy of reason , individualism , and capitalism , and depicts what Rand saw to be the failures of governmental coercion . Atlas Shrugged received largely negative reviews after its 1957 publication , but achieved enduring popularity and ongoing sales in the following decades . After several unsuccessful attempts to adapt the novel for film or television , a film trilogy based on it was released from 2011 to 2014 .",

After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful , she achieved fame with her 1943 novel , The Fountainhead . In 1957 , Rand published her best-known work , the novel Atlas Shrugged . Afterward , she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy , publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982 . Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion . She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism . In politics , she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism , instead supporting laissez-faire capitalism , which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights , including property rights . In art , Rand promoted romantic realism .",
  "/wiki/The_Fountainhead": "The Fountainhead is a 1943 novel by Russian-American author Ayn Rand , her first major literary success . The novel 's protagonist , Howard Roark , is an individualistic young architect who designs modernist buildings and refuses to compromise with an architectural establishment unwilling to accept innovation . Roark embodies what Rand believed to be the ideal man , and his struggle reflects Rand 's belief that individualism is superior to collectivism . Roark is opposed by what he calls second-handers , who value conformity over independence and integrity . These include Roark 's former classmate , Peter Keating , who succeeds by following popular styles but turns to Roark for help with design problems . Ellsworth Toohey , a socialist architecture critic who uses his influence to promote his political and social agenda , tries to destroy Roark 's career . Tabloid newspaper publisher Gail Wynand seeks to shape popular opinion ; he befriends Roark , then betrays him when public opinion turns in a direction he can not control . The novel 's most controversial character is Roark 's lover , Dominique Francon . She believes that non-conformity has no chance of winning , so she alternates between helping Roark and working to undermine him . Feminist critics have condemned Roark and Dominique 's first sexual encounter , accusing Rand of endorsing rape . Twelve publishers rejected the manuscript before an editor at the Bobbs-Merrill Company risked his job to get it published . Contemporary reviewers ' opinions were polarized .",

  "/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings": "The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien . The story began as a sequel to Tolkien 's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit , but eventually developed into a much larger work . Written in stages between 1937 and 1949 , The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written , with over 150 million copies sold . The title of the novel refers to the story 's main antagonist , the Dark Lord Sauron , [ a ] who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth . From quiet beginnings in the Shire , a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside , the story ranges across Middle-earth , following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters , most notably the hobbits Frodo , Sam , Merry and Pippin . Although generally known to readers as a trilogy , the work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set , the other to be The Silmarillion , but this idea was dismissed by his publisher . For economic reasons , The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 . The three volumes were titled The Fellowship of the Ring , The Two Towers and The Return of the King . Structurally , the novel is divided internally into six books , two per volume , with several appendices of background material included at the end . Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume . The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into 38 languages . Tolkien 's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins .",
  "/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien": "John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE FRSL ( /ru\u02d0l \u02c8t\u0252lki\u02d0n/ ; [ a ] 3 January 1892 - 2 September 1973 ) was an English writer , poet , philologist , and academic , who authored the classic high fantasy works The Hobbit , The Lord of the Rings , and The Silmarillion . He served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College , Oxford , from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College , Oxford , from 1945 to 1959 . He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis - they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings . Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972 . After Tolkien 's death , his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father 's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts , including The Silmarillion . These , together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings , form a connected body of tales , poems , fictional histories , invented languages , and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth [ b ] within it . Between 1951 and 1955 , Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings . While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien , the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre . This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the father of modern fantasy literature - or , more precisely , of high fantasy . In 2008 , The Times ranked him sixth on a list of The 50 greatest British writers since 1945 . Forbes ranked him the fifth top-earning dead celebrity in 2009 .",
