She was one of the most renowned and influential opera singers of the 20th century . Many critics praised her bel canto technique , wide-ranging voice and dramatic interpretations . Her repertoire ranged from classical opera seria to the bel canto operas of Donizetti , Bellini and Rossini and , further , to the works of Verdi and Puccini ; and , in her early career , to the music dramas of Wagner . Her musical and dramatic talents led to her being hailed as La Divina . Born in Manhattan to Greek immigrant parents , she was raised by an overbearing mother who had wanted a son . Maria received her musical education in Greece at age 13 and later established her career in Italy . Forced to deal with the exigencies of 1940s wartime poverty and with near-sightedness that left her nearly blind onstage , she endured struggles and scandal over the course of her career . She turned herself from a heavy woman into a svelte and glamorous one after a mid-career weight loss , which might have contributed to her vocal decline and the premature end of her career . The press exulted in publicizing Callas 's temperamental behavior , her supposed rivalry with Renata Tebaldi and her love affair with Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis . Although her dramatic life and personal tragedy have often overshadowed Callas the artist in the popular press , her artistic achievements were such that Leonard Bernstein called her the Bible of opera and her influence so enduring that , in 2006 , Opera News wrote of her : Nearly thirty years after her death , she 's still the definition of the diva as artist - and still one of classical music 's best-selling vocalists .",

  "/wiki/London_Philharmonic_Orchestra": "The London Philharmonic Orchestra ( LPO ) is a British orchestra and one of five permanent symphony orchestras based in London [ clarification needed ] . It was founded by the conductors Sir Thomas Beecham and Malcolm Sargent in 1932 as a rival to the existing London Symphony Orchestra and BBC Symphony Orchestra . The founders ' ambition was to build an orchestra the equal of any European or American rival . Between 1932 and the Second World War the LPO was widely judged to have succeeded in this regard . After the outbreak of war , the orchestra 's private backers withdrew and the players reconstituted the LPO as a self-governing cooperative . In the post-war years , the orchestra faced challenges from two new rivals ; the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic , founded respectively in 1946 and 1947 , achieved a quality of playing not matched by the older orchestras , including the LPO . By the 1960s the LPO had regained its earlier standards , and in 1964 it secured a valuable engagement to play in the Glyndebourne Festival opera house during the summer months . In 1993 it was appointed resident orchestra of the Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames , one of London 's major concert venues . Since 1995 the residency has been jointly held with the Philharmonia . In addition to its work at the Festival Hall and Glyndebourne , the LPO performs regularly at the Congress Theatre , Eastbourne and the Brighton Dome , and tours nationally and internationally . Since Beecham , the orchestra has had ten principal conductors , including Sir Adrian Boult , Bernard Haitink , Sir Georg Solti , Klaus Tennstedt and Vladimir Jurowski . The orchestra has been active in recording studios since its earliest days , and has played on hundreds of sets made by EMI , Decca and other companies .",

Among the conductors who worked with the orchestra in its early years were Richard Strauss , Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler and Arturo Toscanini ; of the Philharmonia 's younger conductors , the most important to its development was Herbert von Karajan , who though never formally chief conductor was closely associated with the orchestra in the late 1940s and early 1950s . The Philharmonia became widely regarded as the finest of London 's five symphony orchestras in its first two decades . From the late 1950s to the early 1970s the orchestra 's chief conductor was Otto Klemperer , with whom the orchestra gave many concerts and made numerous recordings of the core orchestral repertoire . During Klemperer 's tenure Legge , citing the difficulty of maintaining the orchestra 's high standards , attempted to disband it in 1964 , but the players , backed by Klemperer , formed themselves into a self-governing ensemble as the New Philharmonia Orchestra . After thirteen years under this title , they negotiated the rights to revert to the original name . In Klemperer 's last years the orchestra suffered a decline , both financial and artistic , but recovered under his successor , Riccardo Muti , who revitalised the orchestra in his ten-year term , 1972-1982 . The orchestra 's standards remained high throughout the controversial chief conductorship of Giuseppe Sinopoli from 1984 to 1994 , and the more orthodox tenure of Christoph von Dohn\u00e1nyi between 1997 and 2008 .

Initially Rossini had been invited to compose a work for the inauguration of the house , but he was too busy and so the task fell to Bellini . However , that inaugural season saw three Rossini operas staged , including Mo\u00efse et Pharaon , Semiramide , and Il barbiere di Siviglia .
