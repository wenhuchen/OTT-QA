  "/wiki/Pycard": "Pycard , also spelt Picard and Picart ( late 14th century - early 15th century ) was an English or French Medieval and Renaissance transitional composer . He may have served in John of Gaunt 's household in the 1390s as 'Jehan Pycard alias Vaux ' . The name Picard suggests a French origin , but his music is regarded as being in an English tradition . He is one of the most prolific composers represented in the Old Hall Manuscript ( British Library : Additional 57950 ) , with nine works from it attributed to him . His music is in the ars nova style , and is unusual in its virtuosity .",
  "/wiki/Leonel_Power": "Leonel Power ( also spelled Lionel , Lyonel , Leonellus , Leonelle ; Polbero ; 1370 to 1385 - 5 June 1445 ) was an English composer of the late Medieval and early Renaissance eras . Along with John Dunstaple , he was one of the major figures in English music in the early 15th century .",
  "/wiki/Roy_Henry": "Roy Henry ( King Henry ) ( fl . around 1410 ) was an English composer , almost certainly a king of England : probably Henry V , but also possibly Henry IV . His music , two compositions in all , appears in a position of prominence in the Old Hall Manuscript . Musicologists have not been able to agree on which English monarch wrote the two mass movements which appear , at the head of their respective sections , in the Old Hall Manuscript . Henry IV , who reigned from 1399 to 1413 , was in his early forties when the music was most likely written , since stylistic evidence places it around 1410 . However , by 1410 Henry IV was suffering from a disfiguring disease and struggling to maintain his regal power . Therefore , it is unlikely that he , albeit a talented musician , could be the composer of the two pieces . Whereas Henry V , despite being extremely 'busy on campaigns ' after his succession , was recorded to never have ceased in his fondness for music . In 1420 the Pell Rolls recorded payments for two new harps to be shipped to the King in France . And the King even went so far as to take his chapel to the Agincourt campaign . This , as well as being substantial evidence for his piety , suggests that the latter is the composer . Henry V , who reigned from 1413 to 1422 , was known to have cultivated music in his youth .",
  "/wiki/Byttering": "Byttering ( also Bytering , Bytteryng , or Biteryng ; possible first name Thomas ) ( fl . c. 1400 - 1420 ) was an English composer during the transitional period from Medieval to Renaissance styles . Five of his compositions have survived , all of them in the Old Hall Manuscript . A possible identification of Byttering with a Thomas Byteryng has been made . Byteryng was a canon at Hastings Castle between 1405 and 1408 , and was a rector somewhere in London in 1414 . There is no information on the composer in the Old Hall Manuscript other than that his surname is attached to several pieces . Those pieces stand out from many of the works in the manuscript by their relatively advanced stylistic traits . Byttering 's music includes three mass sections - two Glorias and a Credo - a motet based on Nesciens Mater , and a substantial three-voice , isorhythmic wedding motet , En Katerine solennia/Virginalis contio/Sponsus amat sponsum , his best-known work , which was almost certainly written for the wedding , on 2 June 1420 , of King Henry V and Catherine of Valois . The four-voice Gloria , No . 18 in the Old Hall MS , is one of the most complex canons of the early 15th century , and represents what was probably the extreme of stylistic differentiation between English and continental practice . Canons in continental sources are extremely rare , but there are seven in the Old Hall MS , and Byttering 's is the only one with the standard arrangement of the same tune in all four voices .",
  "/wiki/John_Dunstaple": "John Dunstaple ( or Dunstable , c. 1390 - 24 December 1453 ) was an English composer of polyphonic music of the late medieval era and early Renaissance periods . He was one of the most famous composers active in the early 15th century , a near-contemporary of Leonel Power , and was widely influential , not only in England but on the continent , especially in the developing style of the Burgundian School . The spelling Dunstaple is preferred by Margaret Bent , since it occurs in more than twice as many musical attributions as that of Dunstable . The few English musical sources are equally divided between b and p ; however , the contemporary non-musical sources , including those with a claim to a direct association with the composer , spell his name with a p. Both spellings remain in common usage .",
  "/wiki/John_Plummer_(composer)": "John Plummer ( also Plomer , Plourmel , Plumere , Polmier , Polumier ; c. 1410 - c. 1483 ) was an English composer who flourished during the reign of Henry VI of England . Not many of Plummer 's compositions survive . The motets Anna mater matris Christi ( Anne , mother of the mother of Christ ) and Tota Pulchra Es ( My Love is Wholly Beautiful ) are widely available and recorded . A number of Plummer 's compositions appear in the manuscript Brussels Bilioth\u00e8que Royale MS 5557 . During his own lifetime , knowledge and performance of his works spread at least as far as the present-day Czech Republic , where pieces such as Tota Pulchra Es were copied into the Codex Speci\u00e1ln\u00edk ( c. 1500 ) . These pieces are unaccompanied sacred vocal music written for use in the great royal and noble chapels of northern Europe . Plummer was a member of the English Chapel Royal at least from 1438 , and was also apparently the first to hold the office of Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal from 1444 to 1455 . He left the royal household towards the end of his career and moved to St Georges Chapel , Windsor , where he was a verger . This post is likely to have supported him in his declining years .",

  "/wiki/William_Horwood_(composer)": "William Horwood , also Horewud , was an English polyphonic vocal composer in the late-medieval period ( c. 1430 - 1484 ) . In 1470 , he was a singer at Lincoln Cathedral , in 1476 , he was a vicar choral at Lincoln , and from 1477 until 1484 , he was the Cathedral choirmaster . He has three complete pieces and one incomplete piece in the Eton Choirbook , and one incomplete piece in a York manuscript . Horwood 's Magnificat secundi toni a 5 bears a strong resemblance to compositions of his near contemporary Josquin des Prez ( c. 1440-1521 ) , so much so that he might easily be mistaken for Josquin upon first audition . No mention is made of Horwood among the listing of Josquin 's contemporaries in Grout ; neither is the Eton Choirbook mentioned in Grout . A very scanty on-line article - only a thumbnail description of the composer - is present on ( FM 99.5 , New York ) WBAI producer Chris Whent 's Here of a Sunday Morning site .

  "/wiki/John_Hothby": "John Hothby ( Otteby , Hocby , Octobi , Ottobi , c. 1410-1487 ) , also known by his Latinised names Johannes Ottobi or Johannes de Londonis , was an English Renaissance composer and musical theorist who travelled widely in Europe and gained an international reputation for his work .",
  "/wiki/William_Hawte": "Sir William Hawte ( also Haute or Haut ) ( c. 1430- 2 Jul 1497 ) was a prominent member of a Kentish gentry family of long standing in royal service , which , through its near connections to the Woodville family , became closely and dangerously embroiled in the last phases of the Wars of the Roses . It is claimed that he is the same Sir William Hawte who was a composer of liturgical and devotional choral music ( who flourished c. 1460-1470 ) , represented in a number of manuscript choirbooks that survive to this day . Two settings of the Benedicamus Domino are found in the Pepys Manuscript , and another work attributed to him , a Stella coeli , extirpavit ( a Latin prayer to the Virgin , for protection from plague ) exists in the Ritson Manuscript .",
  "/wiki/Richard_Hygons": "Richard Hygons ( also Higons , Huchons , Hugo ; c. 1435 - c. 1509 ) was an English composer of the early Renaissance . While only two compositions of this late 15th-century composer have survived , one of them , a five-voice setting of the Salve Regina Marian antiphon , has attracted interest from musicologists because of its close relationship to music being written at the same time on the continent , as well as its high level of workmanship .",
  "/wiki/Gilbert_Banester": "Gilbert Banester ( c. 1445 - 1487 ) was an English composer and poet of Flemish influences . Possibly a native of London , he was Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal from 1478 to 1490 . His works are found in a number of Tudor manuscript collections of church music , including the Pepys Manuscript ; there is also an antiphon by his hand in the Eton Choirbook . Stylistically the work is similar to those of William Horwood in the same book , but is unusual in that it is written to a prose text . Two poems have been ascribed to Banester , the Miracle of St Thomas of 1467 and a translation of Boccaccio , dating to 1450 , that is the first known in the English language . Little else is known of Banester 's life . He was recorded as the king 's servant in 1471 . In addition , it is known that Edward IV provided him with corrodies for two Abbeys , and he was made a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1475 . In 1478 he became master of the choristers . He died in 1487 .",

Several works are listed in the name of Turges in the Eton Choirbook , which survived Henry VIII 's Dissolution of the Monasteries between 1536 and 1541 . Turges also has a Magnificat extant in the Caius Choirbook , and compositions in the Fayrfax Boke . A Kyrie and Gloria are ascribed to Sturges in the Ritson Manuscript .
