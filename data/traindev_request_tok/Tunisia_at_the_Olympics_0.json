Meanwhile , Mellouli faded down the stretch to pick up a bronze in 14:40.31 , edging out of South Korea 's Park Tae-hwan ( 14:50.61 ) by a wide margin of 10.3 seconds . Italian teenager Gregorio Paltrinieri finished fifth in 14:51.92 , while U.S. swimmer Connor Jaeger posted a sixth-place time of 14:52.99 .
