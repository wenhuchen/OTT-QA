The league evolved from the former Victorian Football Association ( VFA ) , and has been known by its current name since 1996 . For historical purposes , the present VFL is sometimes referred to as the VFA/VFL , to distinguish it from the present day Australian Football League , which was known until 1990 as the Victorian Football League and is sometimes referred to as the VFL/AFL . The VFA was formed in 1877 and is the second-oldest Australian rules football league , replacing the loose affiliation of clubs that had been the hallmark of the early years of the game . Initially serving a primarily administrative function , the VFA premiership served as the top level of club competition in Victoria until 1896 . The VFA became the secondary level of club competition from 1897 after its eight strongest clubs seceded to form the VFL . From 1897 until 1995 , the VFA remained independent from the VFL as Victoria 's secondary senior club competition . Although always much less popular than the VFL/AFL , the VFA enjoyed peaks of popularity in the 1940s with a faster-paced rival code of rules , and in the 1970s bolstered by playing on Sundays at a time when the VFL was played solely on Saturdays . Since 1995 , the league has been administered by AFL Victoria ( and its predecessors ) , and serves as one of the second-tier regional Australian semi-professional competitions which sits underneath the fully professional Australian Football League . From the 2018 season it will comprise 15 teams from throughout Victoria , nine of which have a continuous VFA heritage . Since 2000 , the VFL has served partially as a reserves competition for the AFL , with some Victorian-based clubs fielding their reserves teams in the VFL and others affiliated such that their reserves player can play in VFL teams .
