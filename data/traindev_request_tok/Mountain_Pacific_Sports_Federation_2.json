  "/wiki/NCAA_D-I": "NCAA Division I ( D-I ) is the highest level of intercollegiate athletics sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) in the United States . D-I schools include the major collegiate athletic powers , with larger budgets , more elaborate facilities and more athletic scholarships than Divisions II and III as well as many smaller schools committed to the highest level of intercollegiate competition . This level was once called the University Division of the NCAA , in contrast to the lower level College Division ; these terms were replaced with numeric divisions in 1973 . The University Division was renamed Division I , while the College Division was split in two ; the College Division members that offered scholarships or wanted to compete against those who did became Division II , while those who did not want to offer scholarships became Division III . For college football only , D-I schools are further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and those institutions that do not have any football program . FBS teams have higher game attendance requirements and more players receiving athletic scholarships than FCS teams . The FBS is named for its series of postseason bowl games , with various polls ranking teams after the conclusion of these games , while the FCS national champion is determined by a multi-team bracket tournament . For the 2014-15 school year , Division I contained 345 of the NCAA 's 1,066 member institutions , with 125 in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , 125 in the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and 95 non-football schools , with six additional schools in the transition from Division II to Division I . There was a moratorium on any additional movement up to D-I until 2012 , after which any school that wants to move to D-I must be accepted for membership by a conference and show the NCAA it has the financial ability to support a D-I program .",
