  "/wiki/Theology": "As defined by Scholasticism , theology is constituted by a triple aspect : what is taught by God , teaches of God and leads to God ( Latin : Theologia a Deo docetur , Deum docet , et ad Deum ducit ) . This indicates the three distinct areas of God as theophanic revelation , the systematic study of the nature of divine and , more generally , of religious belief , and the spiritual path . Theology is taught as an academic discipline , typically in universities and seminaries . It occupies itself with the unique content of analyzing the supernatural , but also deals with religious epistemology , asks and seeks to answer the question of revelation . Revelation pertains to the acceptance of God , gods , or deities , as not only transcendent or above the natural world , but also willing and able to interact with the natural world and , in particular , to reveal themselves to humankind . While theology has turned into a secular field , religious adherents still consider theology to be a discipline that helps them live and understand concepts such as life and love and that helps them lead lives of obedience to the deities they follow or worship .",

When he fell gravely ill several days after his birth , he was baptized by Fr . Chien de Santo Tomas , taking the name of Vicente Liem . Since Tr\u00e0 L\u0169 was one of those Tonkinese villages where Dominican friars preached the Catholic faith , Li\u00eam grew up to be a Christian . He was later brought by his parents to a missionary center where he learned catechism . In 1738 , King Philip V of Spain opened the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and the University of Santo Tomas ( UST ) in the Philippines to Chinese and Tonkinese students , since China and Tonkin did not have Christian educational institutions . The Dominican fathers decided to let Li\u00eam and four other Tonkinese ( Jose de Santo Tomas , Juan de Santo Domingo , Pedro Martir and Pedro de San Jacinto ) study in the Philippines . Vicente took the trivium and the quadrivium in Colegio de San Juan de Letran , now the equivalent of elementary and secondary education . He finished a degree of lector of humanities at Letran .

  "/wiki/Auxiliary_Bishop": "An auxiliary bishop is a bishop assigned to assist the diocesan bishop in meeting the pastoral and administrative needs of the diocese . Auxiliary bishops can also be titular bishops of sees that no longer exist . In the Catholic Church , auxiliary bishops exist in both the Latin Church and in the Eastern Catholic Churches . The particular duties of an auxiliary bishop are given by the diocesan bishop and can vary widely depending on the auxiliary bishop , the ordinary , and the needs of the diocese . In a larger archdiocese , they might be in assigned to serve a portion of the archdiocese ( sometimes called deaneries , regions , or vicariates ) or to serve a particular population such as immigrants or those of a particular heritage or language . Canon law requires that the diocesan bishop appoint each auxiliary bishop as vicar general or episcopal vicar of the diocese . In Eastern Orthodox Churches , auxiliary bishops are also called vicarian bishops or simply vicar-bishops . In the Serbian Orthodox Church , the office of auxiliary ( vicar ) bishop is entrusted to titular bishops , who are assigned with assisting diocesan bishops in various aspects of diocesan administration . The Greek word protosyncellus defines an auxiliary bishop who has been elevated to the dignity of vicarian of another titular bishop , and who is assigned to assist and act on behalf of his episcopal authority over the jurisdiction of the episcopal see .

  "/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War": "The Spanish Civil War ( Spanish : Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola ) [ note 2 ] was a civil war in Spain fought from 1936 to 1939 . Republicans loyal to the left-leaning Second Spanish Republic , in alliance with anarchists and communists , fought against a revolt by the Nationalists , an alliance of Falangists , monarchists , conservatives and Catholics , led by a military group among whom General Francisco Franco soon achieved a preponderant role . Due to the international political climate at the time , the war had many facets and was variously viewed as class struggle , a war of religion , a struggle between dictatorship and republican democracy , between revolution and counterrevolution , and between fascism and communism . It has been frequently called the dress rehearsal for World War II . The Nationalists won the war , which ended in early 1939 , and ruled Spain until Franco 's death in November 1975 . The war began after a pronunciamiento ( a declaration of military opposition ) against the Republican government by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces , originally under the leadership of Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo . The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans , supported in the Cortes by communist and socialist parties , under the leadership of centre-left President Manuel Aza\u00f1a . The Nationalist group was supported by a number of conservative groups , including CEDA , monarchists , including both the opposing Alfonsists and the religious conservative Carlists , and the FE de las JONS , a fascist political party . After the deaths of Sanjurjo , Emilio Mola and Manuel Goded Llopis , Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side . The coup was supported by military units in the Spanish protectorate in Morocco , Pamplona , Burgos , Zaragoza , Valladolid , C\u00e1diz , C\u00f3rdoba , and Seville . However , rebelling units in some important cities - such as Madrid , Barcelona , Valencia , Bilbao , and M\u00e1laga - did not gain control , and those cities remained under the control of the government .

  "/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)": "Civil law , or civilian law , is a legal system originating in Europe , intellectualized within the framework of Roman law , the main feature of which is that its core principles are codified into a referable system which serves as the primary source of law . This can be contrasted with common law systems , the intellectual framework of which comes from judge-made decisional law , and gives precedential authority to prior court decisions , on the principle that it is unfair to treat similar facts differently on different occasions ( doctrine of judicial precedent , or stare decisis ) . Historically , a civil law is the group of legal ideas and systems ultimately derived from the Corpus Juris Civilis , but heavily overlaid by Napoleonic , Germanic , canonical , feudal , and local practices , as well as doctrinal strains such as natural law , codification , and legal positivism . Conceptually , civil law proceeds from abstractions , formulates general principles , and distinguishes substantive rules from procedural rules . It holds case law secondary and subordinate to statutory law . Civil law is often paired with the inquisitorial system , but the terms are not synonymous . There are key differences between a statute and a codal article . The most pronounced features of civil systems are their legal codes , with brief legal texts that typically avoid factually specific scenarios . The short articles in a civil law code deal in generalities and stand in contrast with statutory systems , which are often very long and very detailed .",

  "/wiki/Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)": "The canon law of the Catholic Church ( Latin : jus canonicum ) is the system of laws and legal principles made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities of the Catholic Church to regulate its external organization and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics toward the mission of the Church . It was the first modern Western legal system and is the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West , while the unique traditions of Oriental canon law govern the 23 Eastern Catholic particular churches sui iuris . Positive ecclesiastical laws , based directly or indirectly upon immutable divine law or natural law , derive formal authority in the case of universal laws from promulgation by the supreme legislator - the Supreme Pontiff , who possesses the totality of legislative , executive , and judicial power in his person , or by the College of Bishops acting in communion with the pope - while particular laws derive formal authority from promulgation by a legislator inferior to the supreme legislator , whether an ordinary or a delegated legislator . The actual subject material of the canons is not just doctrinal or moral in nature , but all-encompassing of the human condition . It has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system : laws , courts , lawyers , judges , a fully articulated legal code for the Latin Church as well as a code for the Eastern Catholic Churches , principles of legal interpretation , and coercive penalties . It lacks civilly-binding force in most secular jurisdictions . Those who are versed and skilled in canon law , and professors of canon law , are called canonists ( or colloquially , canon lawyers ) . Canon law as a sacred science is called canonistics .

In present-day use , however , apologetics is no longer treated as part of dogmatic theology but has attained the rank of an independent science , being generally regarded as the introduction to and foundation of dogmatic theology . The term dogmatic theology became more widely used following the Protestant Reformation and was used to designate the articles of faith that the Church had officially formulated . An example of dogmatic theology is the doctrinal statements or dogmas that were formulated by the early church councils who sought to resolve theological problems and to take a stance against a heretical teaching . These creeds or dogmas that came out of the church councils were considered to be authoritative and binding on all Christians because the church officially affirmed them . One of the purposes of dogmatic theology is to formulate and communicate doctrine that is considered essential to Christianity and which if denied would constitute heresy .",
