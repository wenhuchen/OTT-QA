  "/wiki/Recreation_Park_(Pittsburgh)": "Recreation Park was a sporting grounds and stadium located in what is today Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The stadium existed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . During the park 's heyday , the location was considered to be within Allegheny City , but in 1907 , the entire municipality was annexed by its larger neighbor and eventually became Pittsburgh 's North Side . The field was the first National League home for the Pittsburgh Pirates ( at the time referred to as the Alleghenys ) of Major League Baseball . It also hosted many football games of the University of Pittsburgh ( at the time referred to as the Western University of Pennsylvania ) . In November 1892 , the park was the location of the first known American football game that included a professional player . The park left a scant pictorial record . Only one known photograph , taken from a very distant vantage point , shows the grounds in its longtime baseball configuration . It was discovered in 2015 in a time capsule left by scientific instrument maker John Brashear . A much-altered facility appears in later photos , including several newspaper shots of football games ."
