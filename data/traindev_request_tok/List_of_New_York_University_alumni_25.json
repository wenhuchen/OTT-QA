He began his career as a comedy writer in the 1950s , writing jokes and scripts for television and publishing several books of short humor pieces .

In 2004 Comedy Central ranked Allen fourth on a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians , while a UK survey ranked Allen the third-greatest comedian . By the mid-1960s Allen was writing and directing films , first specializing in slapstick comedies before moving into dramatic material influenced by European art cinema during the 1970s , and alternating between comedies and dramas to the present .

  "/wiki/The_Shadow": "The Shadow is the name of a collection of serialized dramas , originally in 1930s pulp novels , and then in a wide variety of media .

The radio drama included episodes voiced by Orson Welles . Originally created to be a mysterious radio-show narrator , The Shadow was developed into a distinctive literary character in 1931 by writer Walter B. Gibson . The Shadow debuted on July 31 , 1930 , as the mysterious narrator of the radio program Detective Story Hour , which was developed to boost sales of Street & Smith 's monthly pulp Detective Story Magazine . When listeners of the program began asking at newsstands for copies of that Shadow detective magazine , Street & Smith decided to create a magazine based on a character called The Shadow and hired Gibson to create a character concept to fit the name and voice and write a story featuring him . The first issue of The Shadow Magazine went on sale on April 1 , 1931 , a pulp series . On September 26 , 1937 , The Shadow radio drama , a new radio series based on the character as created by Gibson for the pulp magazine , premiered with the story The Death House Rescue , in which The Shadow was characterized as having the power to cloud men 's minds so they can not see him . In the magazine stories , The Shadow was not given the literal ability to become invisible . The introduction from The Shadow radio program Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men ? The Shadow knows ! , spoken by actor Frank Readick , has earned a place in the American idiom . These words were accompanied by an ominous laugh and a musical theme , Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns ' Le Rouet d'Omphale ( Omphale 's Spinning Wheel , composed in 1872 ) ."
