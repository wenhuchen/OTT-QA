He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally , bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States . He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III , and awarded a lifetime pension . Although musically precocious , Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant . There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education . When an opportunity for such an education arose , he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory , from which he graduated in 1865 . The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five , with whom his professional relationship was mixed . Tchaikovsky 's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood . From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style - a task that did not prove easy .",

The libretto is adapted from E. T. A. Hoffmann 's story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King . Although the original production was not a success , the 20-minute suite that Tchaikovsky extracted from the ballet was . However , the complete Nutcracker has enjoyed enormous popularity since the late 1960s and is now performed by countless ballet companies , primarily during the Christmas season , especially in North America . Major American ballet companies generate around 40% of their annual ticket revenues from performances of The Nutcracker . The ballet 's score has been used in several film adaptations of Hoffmann 's story . Tchaikovsky 's score has become one of his most famous compositions . Among other things , the score is noted for its use of the celesta , an instrument that the composer had already employed in his much lesser known symphonic ballad The Voyevoda .",

The ballet was premiered by the Bolshoi Ballet on 4 March [ O.S . 20 February ] 1877 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow .

The overture debuted in Moscow on August 20 , 1882 , conducted by Ippolit Al'tani under a tent near the then-unfinished Cathedral of Christ the Saviour , which also memorialized the 1812 defence of Russia . Tchaikovsky himself conducted another performance at the dedication of Carnegie Hall in New York City . That was one of the first times a major European composer visited the United States . The 15 minute overture is best known for its climactic volley of cannon fire , ringing chimes , and brass fanfare finale .

  "/wiki/Symphonies_by_Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky": "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky struggled with sonata form , the primary Western principle for building large-scale musical structures since the middle of the 19th century . Traditional Russian treatment of melody , harmony and structure actually worked against sonata form 's modus operandi of movement , growth and development . Russian music - the Russian creative mentality as a whole , in fact - functioned on the principle of stasis . Russian novels , plays and operas were written as collections of self-contained tableaux , with the plots proceeding from one set-piece to the next . Russian folk music operated along the same lines , with songs comprised as a series of self-contained melodic units repeated continually . Compared to this mindset , the precepts of sonata form probably seemed as alien as if they had arrived from the moon . Sonata form also was not designed to accommodate the emotionally charged statements that Tchaikovsky wanted to make . In this , he was far from alone - it was a major preoccupation of the Romantic age , to the point that the validity of the symphony was questioned seriously and alternatives to it were actually devised . These alternatives , which included program music in general and the symphonic poem in particular , did not offer a complete solution . Instead , they left Tchaikovsky facing a paradox . He reportedly did not care for program music , to the point of reproaching himself for writing the fantasy-overture Romeo and Juliet . Yet the notion of writing symphonies as purely intellectual patterns of chords , rhythms and modulations was at least equally abhorrent .",

His work as choir trainer and organist set standards for Anglican church music that are still influential . He was also active as an academic , becoming Heather Professor of Music at Oxford . Stainer was born in Southwark , London , in 1840 , the son of a cabinet maker .

Unlike most opera composers , Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works . Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Carl Maria von Weber and Giacomo Meyerbeer , Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk ( total work of art ) , by which he sought to synthesise the poetic , visual , musical and dramatic arts , with music subsidiary to drama . He described this vision in a series of essays published between 1849 and 1852 . Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen ( The Ring of the Nibelung ) . His compositions , particularly those of his later period , are notable for their complex textures , rich harmonies and orchestration , and the elaborate use of leitmotifs - musical phrases associated with individual characters , places , ideas , or plot elements . His advances in musical language , such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres , greatly influenced the development of classical music . His Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music . Wagner had his own opera house built , the Bayreuth Festspielhaus , which embodied many novel design features . The Ring and Parsifal were premiered here and his most important stage works continue to be performed at the annual Bayreuth Festival , run by his descendants . His thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again , and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works , including Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg ( The Mastersingers of Nuremberg ) . Until his final years , Wagner 's life was characterised by political exile , turbulent love affairs , poverty and repeated flight from his creditors .",
  "/wiki/Die_Walk\u00fcre": "Die Walk\u00fcre ( The Valkyrie ) , WWV 86B is the second of the four music dramas that constitute Richard Wagner 's Der Ring des Nibelungen , ( English : The Ring of the Nibelung ) . It was performed , as a single opera , at the National Theatre Munich on 26 June 1870 , and received its first performance as part of the Ring cycle at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus on 14 August 1876 . As the Ring cycle was conceived by Wagner in reverse order of performance , Die Walk\u00fcre was the penultimate of the four texts to be written , although Wagner composed the music in performance-sequence . The text was completed by July 1852 , and the music by March 1856 . Wagner largely followed the principles related to the form of musical drama which he had set out in his 1851 essay Opera and Drama under which the music would interpret the text emotionally , reflecting the feelings and moods behind the work , using a system of recurring leitmotifs to represent people , ideas and situations rather than the conventional operatic units of arias , ensembles , and choruses . Wagner showed flexibility in the application of these principles here , particularly in Act 3 when the Valkyries engage in frequent ensemble singing . As with Das Rheingold , Wagner wished to defer any performance of the new work until it could be shown in the context of the completed cycle , but the 1870 Munich premiere was arranged at the insistence of his patron , King Ludwig II of Bavaria . More than the other Ring dramas , Die Walk\u00fcre has achieved some popularity as a stand-alone work , and continues to be performed independently from its role in the tetralogy . The story of Die Walk\u00fcre is based on the Norse mythology told in the Volsunga Saga and the Poetic Edda . In this version the Volsung twins Sieglinde and Siegmund , separated in childhood , meet and fall in love . This union angers the gods who demand that Siegmund must die . Sieglinde and the couple 's unborn child are saved by the defiant actions of Wotan 's daughter , the title character , Valkyrie Br\u00fcnnhilde , who as a result faces the gods ' retribution .",

His bourgeois family did not approve of a musical career for him , and he studied law in Paris and then worked as a civil servant until the age of thirty-nine while immersing himself in the modernist artistic life of the French capital and composing in his spare time . From 1880 until his final illness he was a full-time composer . Although known primarily for two of his orchestral works , Espa\u00f1a and Joyeuse marche , Chabrier left a corpus of operas ( including L'\u00e9toile ) , songs , and piano music , but no symphonies , concertos , quartets , sonatas , or religious or liturgical music . His lack of academic training left him free to create his own musical language , unaffected by established rules , and he was regarded by many later composers as an important innovator and a catalyst who paved the way for French modernism . He was admired by , and influenced , composers as diverse as Debussy , Ravel , Richard Strauss , Satie , Stravinsky , and the group of composers known as Les six . Writing at a time when French musicians were generally proponents or opponents of the music of Wagner , Chabrier steered a middle course , sometimes incorporating Wagnerian traits into his music and at other times avoiding them . Chabrier was associated with some of the leading writers and painters of his time . Among his closest friends was the painter \u00c9douard Manet , and Chabrier collected Impressionist paintings long before they became fashionable . A number of such paintings from his personal collection by artists known to him are now housed in some of the world 's leading art museums . He penned a large number of letters to friends and colleagues which offer an insight into his musical opinions and character . Chabrier died in Paris at the age of fifty-three from a neurological disease , probably caused by syphilis .",

He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy , although both composers rejected the term . In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France 's greatest living composer . Born to a music-loving family , Ravel attended France 's premier music college , the Paris Conservatoire ; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment , whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal . After leaving the conservatoire , Ravel found his own way as a composer , developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of baroque , neoclassicism and , in his later works , jazz . He liked to experiment with musical form , as in his best-known work , Bol\u00e9ro ( 1928 ) , in which repetition takes the place of development . He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers ' music , of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known . A slow and painstaking worker , Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries . Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano , chamber music , two piano concertos , ballet music , two operas and eight song cycles ; he wrote no symphonies or church music . Many of his works exist in two versions : first , a piano score and later an orchestration . Some of his piano music , such as Gaspard de la nuit ( 1908 ) , is exceptionally difficult to play , and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9 ( 1912 ) require skilful balance in performance . Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public .",

The etymology of the name is uncertain , but some propose it may derive from the name of a Royal hunting lodge , the Palacio de la Zarzuela near Madrid , where , allegedly , this type of entertainment was first presented to the court . The palace was named after the place called La Zarzuela because of the profusion of brambles ( zarzas ) that grew there , and so the festivities held within the walls became known as Zarzuelas . There are two main forms of zarzuela : Baroque zarzuela ( c. 1630-1750 ) , the earliest style , and Romantic zarzuela ( c. 1850-1950 ) , which can be further divided into two . Main subgenres are g\u00e9nero grande and g\u00e9nero chico , although other sub-divisions exist . Zarzuela spread to the Spanish dominions , and many Hispanic countries - notably Cuba - developed their own traditions . There is also a strong tradition in the Philippines where it is also known as sarswela/sarsuela . Other regional and linguistic variants in Spain include the Basque zartzuela and the Catalan sarsuela . A masque-like musical theatre had existed in Spain since the time of Juan del Encina . The zarzuela genre was innovative in giving a dramatic function to the musical numbers , which were integrated into the argument of the work .

Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area , he submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany , but did not win , and the unreturned manuscript was lost until rediscovered many decades later .

  "/wiki/Giuseppe_Silvestri": "Giuseppe Silvestri ( 1841-1921 ) was an Italian classical composer and mandolin virtuoso . He is principally remembered today for his role as a mandolinist and for his composition Serenade d'Autrefois ( Serenata medioevale or Serenade of Olden Times ) . He was a celebrated teacher of the mandolin in Naples and Paris , and became popular enough to get the criticism that he was causing Parisians to leave the piano for the mandolin . His fame spread after the Paris Exhibition of 1878 , in which he performed to enthusiastic crowds and reviews . One review said that he made the mandolin produce sounds that resembled those made with the violin , and in other hands the instrument sounded meagre .",

  "/wiki/Librettist": "A libretto ( lit . booklet ) is the text used in , or intended for , an extended musical work such as an opera , operetta , masque , oratorio , cantata or musical . The term libretto is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works , such as the Mass , requiem and sacred cantata , or the story line of a ballet . Libretto ( pronounced [ li\u02c8bretto ] ; plural libretti [ li\u02c8bretti ] ) , from Italian , is the diminutive of the word libro ( book ) . Sometimes other-language equivalents are used for libretti in that language , livret for French works and Textbuch for German . A libretto is distinct from a synopsis or scenario of the plot , in that the libretto contains all the words and stage directions , while a synopsis summarizes the plot . Some ballet historians also use the word libretto to refer to the 15-40 page books which were on sale to 19th century ballet audiences in Paris and contained a very detailed description of the ballet 's story , scene by scene . The relationship of the librettist ( that is , the writer of a libretto ) to the composer in the creation of a musical work has varied over the centuries , as have the sources and the writing techniques employed . In the context of a modern English language musical theatre piece , the libretto is often referred to as the book of the work , though this usage typically excludes sung lyrics .",

The opera was given its premiere on 5 March 1868 at La Scala , Milan , under the baton of the composer , despite his lack of experience and skill as a conductor . However , it was not a success and was immediately withdrawn after only two performances . Revisions in 1875 resulted in success in Bologna and , with further adjustments in 1876 for Venice , the opera was performed elsewhere .",

  "/wiki/Ethnomusicologist": "Ethnomusicology is the study of music from the cultural and social aspects of the people who make it . It encompasses distinct theoretical and methodical approaches that emphasize cultural , social , material , cognitive , biological , and other dimensions or contexts of musical behavior , instead of only its isolated sound component . Folklorists , who began preserving and studying folklore music in Europe and the US in the 19th century , are considered the precursors of the field prior to the Second World War . The term ethnomusicology is said to have been first coined by Jaap Kunst from the Greek words \u1f14\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( ethnos , nation ) and \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae ( mousike , music ) , It is often defined as the anthropology or ethnography of music , or as musical anthropology . During its early development from comparative musicology in the 1950s , ethnomusicology was primarily oriented toward non-Western music , but for several decades it has included the study of all and any musics of the world ( including Western art music and popular music ) from anthropological , sociological and intercultural perspectives . Bruno Nettl once characterized ethnomusicology as a product of Western thinking , proclaiming that ethnomusicology as western culture knows it is actually a western phenomenon ; in 1992 , Jeff Todd Titon described it as the study of people making music .",

While still a schoolboy , Massenet was admitted to France 's principal music college , the Paris Conservatoire . There he studied under Ambroise Thomas , whom he greatly admired . After winning the country 's top musical prize , the Prix de Rome , in 1863 , he composed prolifically in many genres , but quickly became best known for his operas . Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles , from op\u00e9ra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths , romantic comedies , lyric dramas , as well as oratorios , cantatas and ballets . Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public . Despite some miscalculations , he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Like many prominent French composers of the period , Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire . He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896 , when he resigned after the death of the director , Ambroise Thomas .

It was first performed at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris on 19 January 1884 , with sets designed by Eug\u00e8ne Carpezat ( act 1 ) , Auguste Alfred Rub\u00e9 and Philippe Chaperon ( acts 2 and 3 ) , and Jean-Baptiste Lavastre ( act 4 ) . Prior to Massenet 's work , Hal\u00e9vy ( Manon Lescaut , ballet , 1830 ) and Auber ( Manon Lescaut , op\u00e9ra comique , 1856 ) had used the subject for musical stage works . Massenet also wrote a one-act sequel to Manon , Le portrait de Manon ( 1894 ) , involving the Chevalier des Grieux as an older man . The composer worked at the score of Manon at his country home outside Paris and also at a house at The Hague once occupied by Pr\u00e9vost himself . Manon is Massenet 's most popular and enduring opera and , having quickly conquered the world 's stages , it has maintained an important place in the repertory since its creation . It is the quintessential example of the charm and vitality of the music and culture of the Parisian Belle \u00c9poque .

It was first performed at the Op\u00e9ra Garnier in Paris on 16 March 1894 , starring the American soprano Sibyl Sanderson , for whom Massenet had written the title role . The original production was directed by Alexandre Lapissida , with costumes designed by Charles Bianchini and sets by Marcel Jambon ( act 1 , scene 1 ; act 3 ) and Eug\u00e8ne Carpezat ( act 1 , scene 2 ; act 2 ) . The opera was later revised by the composer and was premiered at the same opera house on 13 April 1898 . The work was first performed in Italy at the Teatro Lirico Internazionale in Milan on 17 October 1903 with Lina Cavalieri in the title role and Francesco Maria Bonini as Athana\u00ebl . In 1907 , the role served as Mary Garden 's American debut in New York in the U.S. premiere performance . Tha\u00efs takes place in Egypt under the rule of the Roman Empire , where a Cenobite monk , Athana\u00ebl , attempts to convert Tha\u00efs , an Alexandrian courtesan and devotee of Venus , to Christianity , but discovers too late that his obsession with her is rooted in lust ; while the courtesan 's true purity of heart is revealed , so is the religious man 's baser nature . The work is often described as bearing a sort of religious eroticism , and has had many controversial productions . Its famous M\u00e9ditation , the entr'acte for violin and orchestra played between the scenes of act 2 , is an oft-performed concert music piece ; it has been arranged for many different instruments . The role of Tha\u00efs , similar to another Massenet heroine also written for Sibyl Sanderson , Esclarmonde , is notoriously difficult to sing and is reserved for only the most gifted of performers . Modern interpreters have included Carol Neblett , Anna Moffo , Beverly Sills , Leontyne Price , Ren\u00e9e Fleming , and Elizabeth Futral .

  "/wiki/French_Flute_School": "The French Flute School , as practiced by pupils of Claude-Paul Taffanel at the Paris Conservatoire , employed a playing style featuring a light tone and vibrato . Students strived to capture the sound quality of Taffanel in their own playing . Louis Fleury described Taffanel 's tone as , captivating , and also very full.This reference of a full sound has often been described as powerful and brassy , which can be taken as derogatory . However , when Gaubert was questioned once about this , he redressed the balance by reiterating the word 'full ' by insisting that Taffanel produced a perfectly homogenous tone throughout the entire range of the instrument . This became fundamental quality common to the great flautists of the French School and can be seen in Taffanel 's successors . These flautists used metal flutes of the modified Boehm system by Louis Lot and others . This stood in contrast to the mostly wooden German and English instruments , which their flautists played with a strong and steady sound ."
