  "/wiki/New_Democratic_Party_(Canada)": "The New Democratic Party ( NDP ; French : Nouveau Parti d\u00e9mocratique , NPD ) is a social-democratic federal political party in Canada . The party was founded in 1961 out of the merger of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation ( CCF ) with the Canadian Labour Congress ( CLC ) . On the Canadian political spectrum , the party sits to the left of the Liberal Party . Since 2017 , the NDP has been led by Jagmeet Singh , who is the first Indo-Canadian to lead a major federal party in Canada . The federal and provincial ( or territorial ) level NDPs are more integrated than other political parties in Canada , and have shared membership ( except for the New Democratic Party of Quebec ) . Often the third- or fourth-largest party in Canada 's House of Commons , the NDP has never been in power at the federal level , but it has attained second-largest party status once . In the 2011 election under the leadership of Jack Layton , the NDP won the second most seats in the House , gaining the position of Official Opposition for the first time in the party 's history . The NDP subsequently lost 59 seats in the 2015 federal election and fell to third place in Parliament , though it was their second-best seat count to date . Following the 2019 election , the NDP held the balance of power as the Liberals won a minority government , although the party lost 15 seats and fell to fourth place behind the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois .",
  "/wiki/Acadie\u2014Bathurst": "Acadie - Bathurst ( formerly Gloucester ) is a federal electoral district in New Brunswick , Canada , that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1867 . Until 1997 , the riding was largely held by the Liberal Party thanks to strong support from the francophone Acadian population . There is also a notable Red Tory tendency in the riding that enabled the former Progressive Conservative Party to win on occasion . In the 1997 federal election , the New Democratic Party 's Yvon Godin won an unexpected victory over powerful Liberal cabinet minister Doug Young , mostly due to his Union connections and EI recipients ' reaction to Liberal cuts to Employment Insurance . Godin held the riding until his retirement as of the 2015 federal election , at which point the Liberals reclaimed the riding as part of their sweep of Atlantic Canada .",

  "/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada": "The Liberal Party of Canada ( French : Parti lib\u00e9ral du Canada ) is the oldest and longest-serving political party in Canada . The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada 's history , holding power for almost 70 years in the 20th century - more than any other party in a developed country - and as a result , it is sometimes referred to as Canada 's natural governing party . The party espouses the principles of liberalism , and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned to the centre-right and the New Democratic Party ( who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments ) , occupying the centre-left to left . Like their federal Conservative Party rivals , the party is often described as a big tent , attracting support from a broad spectrum of voters . In the late 1970s , Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the radical centre . The Liberals ' signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care , the Canada Pension Plan , Canada Student Loans , peacekeeping , multilateralism , official bilingualism , official multiculturalism , patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada 's Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Clarity Act , legalizing same-sex marriage , euthanasia , and cannabis , national carbon pricing , and reproductive choice .
