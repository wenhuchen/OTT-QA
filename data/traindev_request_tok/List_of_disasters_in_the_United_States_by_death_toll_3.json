The Delaware Valley 's population of 7.2 million ranks it as the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States . Philadelphia is one of the oldest municipalities in the United States . William Penn , an English Quaker , founded the city in 1682 to serve as capital of the Pennsylvania Colony . Philadelphia played an instrumental role in the American Revolution as a meeting place for the Founding Fathers of the United States , who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 at the Second Continental Congress , and the Constitution at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 . Several other key events occurred in Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War including the First Continental Congress , the preservation of the Liberty Bell , the Battle of Germantown , and the Siege of Fort Mifflin . Philadelphia remained the nation 's largest city until being overtaken by New York City in 1790 ; the city was also one of the nation 's capitals during the revolution , serving as temporary U.S. capital while Washington , D.C. was under construction . In the 19th century , Philadelphia became a major industrial center and a railroad hub .

Aside from steel , Pittsburgh has led in manufacturing of aluminum , glass , shipbuilding , petroleum , foods , sports , transportation , computing , autos , and electronics . For part of the 20th century , Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment ; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita . Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 80s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined , and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out . The population dropped from a peak of 675,000 in 1950 to 370,000 in 1990 . However , this rich industrial history left the area with renowned museums , medical centers , parks , research centers , and a diverse cultural district .

  "/wiki/Fire": "Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion , releasing heat , light , and various reaction products . Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition . Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen , O2 , to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy ( 418 kJ per 32 g of O2 ) ; the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here . At a certain point in the combustion reaction , called the ignition point , flames are produced . The flame is the visible portion of the fire . Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide , water vapor , oxygen and nitrogen . If hot enough , the gases may become ionized to produce plasma . Depending on the substances alight , and any impurities outside , the color of the flame and the fire 's intensity will be different . Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration , which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning . Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe . The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems . The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property , atmospheric pollution , and water contamination .",

With its many tributaries , the Mississippi 's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains . The main stem is entirely within the United States ; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi ( 2,980,000 km2 ) , of which only about one percent is in Canada . The Mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest river and fifteenth-largest river by discharge in the world . The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota , Wisconsin , Iowa , Illinois , Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana . Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years . Most were hunter-gatherers , but some , such as the Mound Builders , formed prolific agricultural societies . The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers , then settlers , ventured into the basin in increasing numbers . The river served first as a barrier , forming borders for New Spain , New France , and the early United States , and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link . In the 19th century , during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny , the Mississippi and several western tributaries , most notably the Missouri , formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States .

With an overall length of 785 ft ( 239 m ) , the Akron and her sister ship the Macon were among the largest flying objects ever built . Although the LZ129 Hindenburg and the LZ130 Graf Zeppelin II were some 18 ft ( 5.5 m ) longer and slightly more voluminous , the two German airships were filled with hydrogen , so the US Navy craft still hold the world record for helium-filled airships . The Akron was destroyed in a thunderstorm off the coast of New Jersey on the morning of 4 April 1933 , killing 73 of the 76 crewmen and passengers . This accident involved the greatest loss of life in any airship crash up until that date .",
  "/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean": "The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world 's oceans , with an area of about 106,460,000 square kilometers ( 41,100,000 square miles ) . It covers approximately 20 percent of Earth 's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area . It separates the Old World from the New World . The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated , S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Europe and Africa to the east , and the Americas to the west . As one component of the interconnected World Ocean , it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean , to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest , the Indian Ocean in the southeast , and the Southern Ocean in the south ( other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica ) . The Equatorial Counter Current subdivides it into the North ( ern ) Atlantic Ocean and the South ( ern ) Atlantic Ocean at about 8\u00b0N . Scientific explorations of the Atlantic include the Challenger expedition , the German Meteor expedition , Columbia University 's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office .",
  "/wiki/New_Jersey": "New Jersey is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Northeastern United States . It is bordered on the north and east by the state of New York ; on the east , southeast , and south by the Atlantic Ocean ; on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania ; and on the southwest by the Delaware Bay and the State of Delaware . New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark . New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",

  "/wiki/Flood": "A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry . In the sense of flowing water , the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide . Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture , civil engineering and public health . Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies , such as a river , lake , or ocean , in which the water overtops or breaks levees , resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries , or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood . While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt , these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals . Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel , particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway . Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers . While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water , people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry . Some floods develop slowly , while others can develop in just a few minutes and without visible signs of rain . Additionally , floods can be local , impacting a neighborhood or community , or very large , affecting entire river basins .",

  "/wiki/Earthquake": "An earthquake ( also known as a quake , tremor or temblor ) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth 's lithosphere that creates seismic waves . Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they can not be felt to those violent enough to propel objects ( and people ) into the air , and wreak destruction across entire cities . The seismicity , or seismic activity , of an area is the frequency , type , and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time . The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling . At the Earth 's surface , earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground . When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore , the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami . Earthquakes can also trigger landslides and occasionally , volcanic activity . In its most general sense , the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event - whether natural or caused by humans - that generates seismic waves . Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity , landslides , mine blasts , and nuclear tests . An earthquake 's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter . The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter .",
  "/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake": "The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred on Californias Central Coast on October 17 at 5:04 p.m. local time ( 1989-10-18 00:04 UTC ) . The shock was centered in The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park approximately 10 mi ( 16 km ) northeast of Santa Cruz on a section of the San Andreas Fault System and was named for the nearby Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains . With an Mw magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of IX ( Violent ) , the shock was responsible for 63 deaths and 3,757 injuries . The Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas Fault System had been relatively inactive since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake ( to the degree that it was designated a seismic gap ) until two moderate foreshocks occurred in June 1988 and again in August 1989 . Damage was heavy in Santa Cruz County and less so to the south in Monterey County , but effects extended well to the north into the San Francisco Bay Area , both on the San Francisco Peninsula and across the bay in Oakland . No surface faulting occurred , though many other ground failures and landslides were present , especially in the Summit area of the Santa Cruz Mountains . Liquefaction was also a significant issue , especially in the heavily damaged Marina District of San Francisco , but its effects were also seen in the East Bay , and near the shore of Monterey Bay , where a non-destructive tsunami was also observed . Because it happened during a national live broadcast of the 1989 World Series , taking place between Bay Area teams San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics , it is sometimes referred to as the World Series earthquake . Rush-hour traffic on the Bay Area freeways was lighter than normal because the game , being played at Candlestick Park in San Francisco , was about to begin , and this may have prevented a larger loss of life , as several of the Bay Area 's major transportation structures suffered catastrophic failures . The collapse of a section of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland was the site of the largest number of casualties for the event , but the collapse of man-made structures and other related accidents contributed to casualties occurring in San Francisco , Los Altos , and Santa Cruz .",
  "/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area": "The San Francisco Bay Area , popularly referred to as the Bay Area or simply the Bay , is a populous region surrounding the San Francisco , San Pablo , and Suisun Bay estuaries in Northern California . Although the exact boundaries of the region vary depending on the source , the Bay Area is defined by the Association of Bay Area Governments to include the nine counties that border the aforementioned estuaries : Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , Napa , San Mateo , Santa Clara , Solano , Sonoma , and San Francisco . Other sources may exclude parts of or even entire counties , or expand the definition to include neighboring counties that do not border the bay such as San Benito , San Joaquin , and Santa Cruz . Home to approximately 7.75 million people , Northern California 's nine-county Bay Area contains many cities , towns , airports , and associated regional , state , and national parks , connected by a complex multimodal transportation network . The larger combined statistical area of the region , which includes fourteen counties , is the second-largest in California ( after the Greater Los Angeles area ) , the fifth-largest in the United States , and the 41st-largest urban area in the world with 9.67 million people . The Bay Area 's population is ethnically diverse : for example , roughly half of the region 's residents are Hispanic , Asian , African American , or Pacific Islander , all of whom have a significant presence throughout the region . The earliest archaeological evidence of human settlements in the Bay Area dates back to 8000-10,000 BC ( from shell mounds in the Coyote Hills ) . In 1769 , the Bay Area was inhabited by the Ohlone people when a Spanish exploration party led by Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 entered the Bay - the first documented European visit to the Bay Area . After Mexico established independence from Spain in 1821 , the region was briefly controlled by the Mexican government until the United States purchased the territory in 1846 during the Mexican-American War . Soon after , discovery of gold in California attracted a flood of treasure seekers , many using ports in the Bay Area as an entry point . During the early years of California 's statehood , state legislative business rotated between three locations in the Bay Area before a permanent state capital was established in Sacramento . A major earthquake leveled the city of San Francisco and environs in 1906 , but the region quickly rebuilt in time to host the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition .",
