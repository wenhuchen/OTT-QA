The Olympic Committee of the USSR was formed on April 21 , 1951 , and the IOC recognised the new body in its 45th session ( May 7 , 1951 ) . In the same year , when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member , the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement .

The Unified Team was sometimes informally called the CIS Team ( Commonwealth of Independent States , as a counterpart of CIS national football team taking part in Euro 1992 of the same year ) , although Georgia did not join the CIS until 1993 . During the Winter Olympics , the National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) of the constituent countries had not yet been affiliated to the IOC , so the Olympic Flag was used in place of a national flag at the Opening Ceremony and at medals ceremonies , and the Olympic Hymn was played for gold medallists . By the time of the Summer Olympics , the NOCs had affiliated separately , though they fielded a joint team with a standard uniform as Olympic qualifying rounds had been completed before the final demise of the Soviet Union . Where an EUN individual won a medal , the national flag of the medallist 's nation was raised rather than the Olympic flag , and a gold medallist 's national anthem was played rather than the Olympic Hymn . In team sports , the EUN team continued to use the Olympic flag and the Olympic Hymn , as team members represented different nations . The team finished second in the medal table at the 1992 Winter Games , and first at the 1992 Summer Games , edging its old rival the US in the latter .",
