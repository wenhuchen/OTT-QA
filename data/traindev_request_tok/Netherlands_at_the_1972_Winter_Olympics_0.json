  "/wiki/Stien_Baas-Kaiser": "Christina ( Stien ) Wilhelmina Baas-Kaiser ( born 20 May 1938 ) is a former speed skater from the Netherlands . She was not selected for the 1964 Winter Olympics because of her 'old age ' ( 25 at that time ) but later turned out to be the first Dutch female world class speed skater . In both 1965 and 1966 , she won bronze at the World Allround Championships . After having become World Allround Champion twice ( in 1967 and 1968 ) - and also winning her 3rd and 4th Dutch Allround Championships those years - she participated at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble . Her two bronze medals - on the 1,500 m , behind Finnish skater Kaija Mustonen and Dutch compatriot Carry Geijssen , and on the 3,000 m behind compatriot Ans Schut and , once more , Kaija Mustonen - were a bit disappointing . Not she , but Geijssen ( who not only won silver on the 1,500 m , but also gold on the 1,000 m ) and Schut became the Dutch heroines of those Olympics . Although she was still a formidable competitor in the years that followed , Kaiser was slightly surpassed at major championships by Atje Keulen-Deelstra , who was the same age as Kaiser . In 1972 , by then married and 33 years old , Baas-Kaiser was no longer really considered to be a favourite , especially not after her disappointing 11th place at the European Allround Championships . At the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo , Baas-Kaiser originally was not meant to skate , but since fellow Dutch skater Trijnie Rep had disappointed on the 500 m ( finishing 20th ) and the 1,000 m ( finishing 24th ) , Baas-Kaiser was given a chance on the 1,500 m and the 3,000 m. And she turned it into something beautiful : On the 1,500 m , she won silver behind Dianne Holum , but ahead of Atje Keulen-Deelstra , and on the 3,000 m two days later , she became Olympic Champion ahead of Holum and Keulen-Deelstra . She ended her skating career later that year with a silver medal at the World Allround Championships . Nationally , she won the allround titles in 1964 , 1965 , 1967-1969 and 1971 , finished second in 1970 and 1972 , and third in 1966 . In 1967 , she was chosen the Dutch Sportswoman of the Year .",
