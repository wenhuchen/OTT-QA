The Stanley Cup , the oldest professional sports trophy in North America , is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season . The National Hockey League was organized on November 26 , 1917 , at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) , which had been founded in 1909 in Renfrew , Ontario .

  "/wiki/Goaltender": "In ice hockey , the goaltender or goalie is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team 's net , thus preventing the opposing team from scoring . The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the goal crease ( often referred to simply as the crease or the net ) . Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots . In today 's age of goaltending there are two common styles , butterfly and hybrid ( hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique ) . Because of the power of shots , the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact . The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice , as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game . One-on-one situations , such as breakaways and shootouts , have the tendency to highlight a goaltender 's pure skill , or lack thereof . No more than one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time . Teams are not required to use a goaltender and may instead opt to play with an additional skater , but the defensive disadvantage this poses generally means that the strategy is only used as a desperation maneuver when trailing late in a game or can be used if the opposing team has a delayed penalty ( if the team receiving the penalty touches the puck the play will stop ) . The goaltender is also known as the goalie , goaler , goalkeeper , net minder , and tender by those involved in the hockey community . In the early days of the sport , the term was spelled with a hyphen as goal-tender . The art of playing the position is called goaltending and there are coaches , usually called the goalie coach who specialize exclusively in working with goaltenders .",

Explaining his decision to retire , Jones said , It [ championship golf ] is something like a cage . First you are expected to get into it and then you are expected to stay there . But of course , nobody can stay there . Jones is most famous for his unique Grand Slam , consisting of his victory in all four major golf tournaments of his era ( the open and amateur championships in both the U.S. & the U.K. ) in a single calendar year ( 1930 ) . In all Jones played in 31 majors , winning 13 and placing among the top ten finishers 27 times .",

  "/wiki/James_Joule": "James Prescott Joule FRS FRSE ( /d\u0292a\u028al , d\u0292u\u02d0l/ ; [ a ] 24 December 1818 - 11 October 1889 ) was an English physicist , mathematician and brewer , born in Salford , Lancashire . Joule studied the nature of heat , and discovered its relationship to mechanical work ( see energy ) . This led to the law of conservation of energy , which in turn led to the development of the first law of thermodynamics . The SI derived unit of energy , the joule , is named after him . Joule worked with Lord Kelvin to develop an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale , which came to be called the Kelvin scale . Joule also made observations of magnetostriction , and he found the relationship between the current through a resistor and the heat dissipated , which is also called Joule 's first law . His experiments about energy transformations were first published in 1843 ."
