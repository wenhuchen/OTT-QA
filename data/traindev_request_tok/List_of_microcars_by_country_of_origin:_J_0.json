  "/wiki/Japan": "Japan ( Japanese : \u65e5\u672c , Nippon [ \u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) or Nihon [ \u0272iho\ua71c\u0274 ] ( listen ) ) is an island country located in East Asia . It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

Originally a small fishing village named Edo ( \u6c5f\u6238 ) , the city became a prominent political center of Japan when Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters in 1603 . When Emperor Meiji moved the imperial seat to the city from Kyoto in 1868 , Edo was renamed Tokyo , literally the Eastern Capital . The Tokyo Metropolis formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture ( \u6771\u4eac\u5e9c , T\u014dky\u014d-fu ) and the city of Tokyo ( \u6771\u4eac\u5e02 , T\u014dky\u014d-shi ) . While commonly referred to as a city , Tokyo is a collective entity of multiple smaller municipalities , including 23 special wards and various bed towns in the western area . Modern Tokyo is categorized as an alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network . As of 2019 , the population of Tokyo was estimated to be over 13.9 million , making it Japan 's most populous prefecture . The metropolitan area is the world 's most populous with over 40 million people as well as the world 's largest urban agglomeration economy .
