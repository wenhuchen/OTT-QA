  "/wiki/John_Alexander_McClernand": "John Alexander McClernand ( May 30 , 1812 - September 20 , 1900 ) was an American lawyer and politician , and a Union general in the American Civil War . He was a prominent Democratic politician in Illinois and a member of the United States House of Representatives before the war . McClernand was firmly dedicated to the principles of Jacksonian democracy and supported the Compromise of 1850 . McClernand was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers in 1861 . His was a classic case of the politician-in-uniform coming into conflict with career Army officers , graduates of the United States Military Academy . He served as a subordinate commander under Ulysses S. Grant in the Western Theater , fighting in the battles of Belmont , Fort Donelson , and Shiloh in 1861-62 . A close friend and political ally of Abraham Lincoln , McClernand was given permission to recruit a force to conduct an operation against Vicksburg , Mississippi , which would rival the effort of Grant , his department commander . Grant was able to neutralize McClernand 's independent effort after it conducted an expedition to win the Battle of Arkansas Post , and McClernand became the senior corps commander in Grant 's army for the Vicksburg Campaign in 1863 . During the Siege of Vicksburg , Grant relieved McClernand of his command by citing his intemperate and unauthorized communication with the press , finally putting an end to a rivalry that had caused Grant discomfort since the beginning of the war . McClernand left the Army in 1864 and served as a judge and a politician in the postbellum era .",
  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",

  "/wiki/US_Constitution": "The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States of America . The Constitution , originally comprising seven articles , delineates the national frame of government . Its first three articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers , whereby the federal government is divided into three branches : the legislative , consisting of the bicameral Congress ( Article One ) ; the executive , consisting of the president ( Article Two ) ; and the judicial , consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts ( Article Three ) . Articles Four , Five and Six embody concepts of federalism , describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments , the states in relationship to the federal government , and the shared process of constitutional amendment . Article Seven establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen States to ratify it . It is regarded as the oldest written and codified national constitution in force . Since the Constitution came into force in 1789 , it has been amended 27 times , including one amendment that repealed a previous one , in order to meet the needs of a nation that has profoundly changed since the eighteenth century . In general , the first ten amendments , known collectively as the Bill of Rights , offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and place restrictions on the powers of government . The majority of the seventeen later amendments expand individual civil rights protections . Others address issues related to federal authority or modify government processes and procedures . Amendments to the United States Constitution , unlike ones made to many constitutions worldwide , are appended to the document .

  "/wiki/William_Porcher_Miles": "William Porcher Miles ( July 4 , 1822 - May 11 , 1899 ) was among the ardent states ' rights advocates , supporters of slavery , and Southern secessionists who came to be known as the Fire-Eaters . He is notable for having designed the most popular variant of the Confederate flag , originally rejected as the national flag in 1861 but adopted as a battle flag by the Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee before it was reincorporated . Born in South Carolina , he showed little early interest in politics , and his early career included the study of law and a tenure as a mathematics professor at the Charleston College from 1843 to 1855 . In the late 1840s , as sectional issues roiled South Carolina politics , Miles began to speak up on sectional issues . He opposed both the Wilmot Proviso and the Compromise of 1850 . From then on , Miles would look at any northern efforts to restrict slavery as justification for secession . Miles was elected as mayor of Charleston in 1855 and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1857 until South Carolina seceded , in December 1860 . He was a member of the state secession convention and a representative from South Carolina at the Confederate Convention in Montgomery , Alabama , which established the provisional government and constitution for the Confederate States . He represented his state in the Confederate House of Representatives during the American Civil War .",
  "/wiki/South_Carolina's_4th_congressional_district": "The 4th Congressional District of South Carolina is a congressional district in upstate South Carolina bordering North Carolina . It includes parts of Greenville and Spartanburg counties . The district is characterized by the two major cities of Greenville and Spartanburg . The district is the state 's wealthiest district and one of its most conservative . In the late 20th century , it has been in Republican hands since 1979 , aside from a six-year stint by Democrat Liz J. Patterson , the daughter of former Senator Olin Johnston . Even before the Republicans finally took control of the seat , the 4th had been a rather conservative district . Like in most of the state , the old-line Southern Democrats began splitting their tickets as early as the 1940s . However , this area 's white conservatives became increasingly willing to support Republicans at the state and local level as early as the 1970s , well before the rest of the state swung Republican . The district is a major destination for presidential candidates in election years , as South Carolina is one of the first states to hold a presidential primary . Republican William Timmons has represented the district since January 3 , 2019 . He succeeded Republican Trey Gowdy who did not seek reelection .",

  "/wiki/South_Carolina's_5th_congressional_district": "The 5th Congressional District of South Carolina is a congressional district in northern South Carolina bordering North Carolina . The district includes all of Cherokee , Chester , Fairfield , Kershaw , Lancaster , Lee , Union and York counties and parts of Newberry , Spartanburg and Sumter counties . Outside the rapidly growing cities of Rock Hill , Fort Mill , and Lake Wylie the district is mostly rural and agricultural . The district borders were contracted from some of the easternmost counties in the 2012 redistricting . The district 's character is very similar to other mostly rural districts in the South . Democrats still hold most offices outside Republican-dominated York County . However , few of the area 's Democrats can be described as liberal by national standards ; most are fairly conservative on social issues , but less so on economics . The largest blocs of Republican voters are in the fast-growing suburbs of Charlotte , North Carolina and Cherokee County , which shares the Republican tilt of most of the rest of the Upstate . York County is by far the largest county in the district , with almost one-third of its population , and its Republican bent has pushed the district as a whole into the Republican column in recent years . In November 2010 , the Republican Mick Mulvaney defeated longtime Congressman John Spratt and became the first Republican since Robert Smalls and the end of Reconstruction to represent the district . Following Mulvaney 's confirmation as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget , a special election was held in 2017 to determine his successor . Republican Ralph Norman narrowly won the special election against Archie Parnell .",

  "/wiki/South_Carolina's_6th_congressional_district": "The 6th Congressional District of South Carolina is a congressional district in central and eastern South Carolina . It includes all of Allendale , Bamberg , Clarendon , Colleton , Hampton , Jasper and Williamsburg counties and parts of Beaufort , Berkeley , Calhoun , Charleston , Dorchester , Orangeburg , Richland and Sumter counties . The district borders were shifted south in the 2012 redistricting . It lost its share of the North Carolina border , and now takes in part of the area near the South Carolina-Georgia border . The district 's current configuration dates from a deal struck in the early 1990s between state Republicans and Democrats in the South Carolina General Assembly to create a majority-black district . The rural counties of the historical black belt in South Carolina make up much of the district , but it sweeps south to include most of the majority-black precincts in and around Charleston , and sweeps west to include most of the majority-black precincts in and around Columbia . In all of its configurations , its politics have been dominated by black voters in the Columbia and Charleston areas . Following the Reconstruction era , the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed Jim Crow laws , as well as a new constitution in 1895 that effectively disfranchised blacks , crippling the Republican Party in the state . For most of the next 60 years , South Carolina was essentially a one-party state dominated by the Democrats , and blacks were nearly excluded from the political system . Demographic and political changes have included the Great Migration of blacks out of the state during the Jim Crow era in the first half of the 20th century . At the same time , many white Democrats felt chagrin at the national party 's greater support of civil rights for blacks from the 1940s onward , and began splitting their tickets in federal elections . After successes of the Civil Rights Movement in gaining passage of federal legislation in the mid-1960s to enforce their constitutional rights and ability to vote , blacks in South Carolina supported national Democratic candidates .",

  "/wiki/Mississippi's_2nd_congressional_district": "Mississippi 's 2nd congressional district ( MS-2 ) covers much of Western Mississippi . It includes most of Jackson , the riverfront cities of Greenville and Vicksburg and the interior market cities of Clarksdale , Greenwood and Clinton . The district is approximately 275 miles ( 443 km ) long , 180 miles ( 290 km ) wide and borders the Mississippi River ; it encompasses much of the Mississippi Delta , and a total of 15 counties and parts of several others . It is the only majority-black district in the state . The district is home to four of Mississippi 's eight public four-year colleges and universities : Alcorn State University in Lorman ; Delta State University in Cleveland ; Jackson State University in Jackson ; and Mississippi Valley State University in Itta Bena , a few miles west of Greenwood . All except Delta State are HBCUs and are members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference . From statehood to the election of 1846 , Mississippi elected representatives at-large statewide on a general ticket . This favored candidates who could command a majority of the voters , then consisting mostly of white men of property . Following Reconstruction , the Democratic Party regained control of the state legislature and worked to reduce Republican voting strength in the state . It redefined congressional districts , creating a 'shoestring ' congressional district running the length of the Mississippi River and taking in the black-majority ( then Republican ) areas of the Mississippi Delta . By this gerrymandering , they created five other districts with white majorities . Election campaigns were often accompanied by fraud and violence as Democrats tried to reduce black Republican voting .",
