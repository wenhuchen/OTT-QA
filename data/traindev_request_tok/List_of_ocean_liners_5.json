  "/wiki/RMS_Queen_Elizabeth": "The RMS Queen Elizabeth was an ocean liner operated by Cunard Line . With Queen Mary she provided weekly luxury liner service between Southampton in the United Kingdom and New York City in the United States , via Cherbourg in France . While being constructed in the mid-1930s by John Brown and Company at Clydebank , Scotland , the build was known as Hull 552 . Launched on 27 September 1938 , she was named in honour of Queen Elizabeth , then Queen Consort to King George VI , who became the Queen Mother in 1952 . With a design that improved upon that of Queen Mary , Queen Elizabeth was a slightly larger ship , the largest passenger liner ever built at that time and for 56 years thereafter . She also has the distinction of being the largest-ever riveted ship by gross tonnage . She first entered service in February 1940 as a troopship in the Second World War , and it was not until October 1946 that she served in her intended role as an ocean liner . With the decline in popularity of the transatlantic route , both ships were replaced by the smaller , more economical Queen Elizabeth 2 in 1969 . Queen Mary was retired from service on 9 December 1967 , and was sold to the city of Long Beach , California . Queen Elizabeth was sold to a succession of buyers , most of whom had unsuccessful plans for her . Finally Queen Elizabeth was sold to Hong Kong businessman Tung Chao Yung , who intended to convert her into a floating university cruise ship called Seawise University .
