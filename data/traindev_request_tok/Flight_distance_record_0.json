  "/wiki/Steve_Fossett": "James Stephen Steve Fossett ( April 22 , 1944 - September 3 , 2007 ) was an American businessman and a record-setting aviator , sailor , and adventurer . He was the first person to fly solo nonstop around the world in a balloon and in a fixed-wing aircraft . He made his fortune in the financial services industry and was best known for many world records , including five nonstop circumnavigations of the Earth : as a long-distance solo balloonist , as a sailor , and as a solo flight fixed-wing aircraft pilot . A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Explorers Club , Fossett set more than one hundred records [ verification needed ] in five different sports , sixty of which still stood at the time of his death . He broke three of the seven absolute world records for fixed-wing aircraft recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale , all in his Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer . In 2002 , he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club of the UK , and was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2007 . Fossett disappeared on September 3 , 2007 while flying a light aircraft over the Great Basin Desert , between Nevada and California . Extensive searches proved unsuccessful , and he was declared legally dead in February of the following year . In September 2008 , a hiker found Fossett 's identification cards in the Sierra Nevada Mountains , California , leading shortly after to the discovery of the plane 's wreckage . Fossett 's only known remains , two large bones , were found half a mile from the crash site , probably scattered by wild animals .",

  "/wiki/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress": "The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is an American long-range , subsonic , jet-powered strategic bomber . The B-52 was designed and built by Boeing , which has continued to provide support and upgrades . It has been operated by the United States Air Force ( USAF ) since the 1950s . The bomber is capable of carrying up to 70,000 pounds ( 32,000 kg ) of weapons , and has a typical combat range of more than 8,800 miles ( 14,080 km ) without aerial refueling . Beginning with the successful contract bid in June 1946 , the B-52 design evolved from a straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings . The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952 . Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era deterrence missions , the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36 . A veteran of several wars , the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat . The B-52 's official name Stratofortress is rarely used ; informally , the aircraft has become commonly referred to as the BUFF ( Big Ugly Fat Fucker/Fella ) . [ Note 1 ] The B-52 has been in active service with the USAF since 1955 . As of June 2019 [ update ] , 58 are in active service , 18 in reserves , and approximately 12 more aircraft in long term storage . The bombers flew under the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) until it was disestablished in 1992 and its aircraft absorbed into the Air Combat Command ( ACC ) ; in 2010 , all B-52 Stratofortresses were transferred from the ACC to the newly created Air Force Global Strike Command ( AFGSC ) .",

  "/wiki/Perth,_Western_Australia": "Perth ( /\u02c8p\u025c\u02d0r\u03b8/ ( listen ) PURTH ) is the capital and largest city of the Australian state of Western Australia ( WA ) . It is named after the city of Perth , Scotland and is Australia 's fourth-most populous city , with a population of 2.06 million living in Greater Perth . Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia , with most of the metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain , a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp . The first areas settled were on the Swan River at Guildford , with the city 's central business district and port ( Fremantle ) both later founded downriver . Captain James Stirling founded Perth in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony . It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for several large mining operations . As part of Perth 's role as the capital of Western Australia , the state 's Parliament and Supreme Court are in the city , as is Government House , the residence of the Governor of Western Australia .",

  "/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces": "The United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF or AAF ) was the aerial warfare service component of the United States Army , and de facto aerial warfare service branch of the United States , during and immediately after World War II ( 1939/41-1945 ) , successor to the previous United States Army Air Corps , and the direct predecessor of the United States Air Force of today , one of the five uniformed military services . The AAF was a component of the United States Army , which on 2 March 1942 was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces : the Army Ground Forces , the Services of Supply ( which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces ) , and the Army Air Forces . Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Army Chief of Staff . The AAF administered all parts of military aviation formerly distributed among the Air Corps , General Headquarters Air Force , and the ground forces ' corps area commanders , and thus became the first air organization of the U.S. Army to control its own installations and support personnel . The peak size of the AAF during the Second World War was over 2.4 million men and women in service and nearly 80,000 aircraft by 1944 , and 783 domestic bases in December 1943 . By V-E Day , the Army Air Forces had 1.25 million men stationed overseas and operated from more than 1,600 airfields worldwide . The Army Air Forces was created in June 1941 to provide the air arm a greater autonomy in which to expand more efficiently , to provide a structure for the additional command echelons required by a vastly increased force , and to end an increasingly divisive administrative battle within the Army over control of aviation doctrine and organization that had been ongoing since the creation of an aviation section within the U.S. Army Signal Corps in 1914 . The AAF succeeded both the Air Corps , which had been the statutory military aviation branch since 1926 , and the GHQ Air Force , which had been activated in 1935 to quiet the demands of airmen for an independent Air Force similar to the Royal Air Force which had already been established in the United Kingdom . Although other nations already had separate air forces independent of their army or navy ( such as the British Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe ) , the AAF remained a part of the Army until a defense reorganization in the post-war period resulted in the passage by the United States Congress of the National Security Act of 1947 with the creation of an independent United States Air Force in September 1947 . In its expansion and conduct of the war , the AAF became more than just an arm of the greater organization . By the end of World War II , the Army Air Forces had become virtually an independent service . By regulation and executive order , it was a subordinate agency of the United States Department of War ( as were the Army Ground Forces and the Army Service Forces ) tasked only with organizing , training , and equipping combat units , and limited in responsibility to the continental United States .",
  "/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress": "The Boeing B-29 Superfortress is a four-engine propeller-driven heavy bomber designed by Boeing and flown primarily by the United States during World War II and the Korean War . Named in allusion to its predecessor , the B-17 Flying Fortress , the Superfortress was designed for high-altitude strategic bombing but also excelled in low-altitude night incendiary bombing , and in dropping naval mines to blockade Japan . B-29s also dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki which contributed to the end of World War II . One of the largest aircraft of World War II , the B-29 had state-of-the-art technology , including a pressurized cabin ; dual-wheeled , tricycle landing gear ; and an analog computer-controlled fire-control system that allowed one gunner and a fire-control officer to direct four remote machine gun turrets . The $ 3 billion cost of design and production ( equivalent to $ 43 billion today ) - far exceeding the $ 1.9 billion cost of the Manhattan Project - made the B-29 program the most expensive of the war . The B-29 's advanced design allowed it to remain in service in various roles throughout the 1950s . The type was retired in the early 1960s , after 3,970 had been built . A few were used as flying television transmitters by the Stratovision company . The Royal Air Force flew the B-29 as the Washington until 1954 . The B-29 was the progenitor of a series of Boeing-built bombers , transports , tankers , reconnaissance aircraft and trainers . The re-engined B-50 Superfortress became the first aircraft to fly around the world non-stop , during a 94-hour flight in 1949 . The Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter airlifter , first flown in 1944 , was followed in 1947 by its commercial airliner variant , the Boeing Model 377 Stratocruiser .",

The IJAAS also provided aerial reconnaissance to other branches of the IJA . While the IJAAS engaged in strategic bombing of cities such as Shanghai , Nanking , Canton , Chongqing , Rangoon , and Mandalay , this was not the primary mission of the IJAAS , and it lacked a heavy bomber force .

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia .

While no longer used as an operational commercial , military , or general aviation airfield , a section is still used as a helicopter base by the New York City Police Department ( NYPD ) , and one runway is reserved for hobbyists flying radio-controlled aircraft . Floyd Bennett Field was created by connecting Barren Island and several smaller islands to the rest of Brooklyn by filling the channels between them with sand pumped from the bottom of Jamaica Bay . The airport was named after Floyd Bennett , a noted aviator who piloted the first plane to fly over the North Pole and had visualized an airport at Barren Island before dying in 1928 ; construction on Bennett Field started the same year . The airport was dedicated on June 26 , 1930 , and officially opened to commercial flights on May 23 , 1931 . Despite the exceptional quality of its facilities , Bennett Field never received much commercial traffic , and it was used instead for general aviation . During the interwar period , dozens of aviation records were set by aviators flying to or from Bennett Field .

The town covers a total area of 29 square kilometres ( 11 sq mi ) of land . The bay is a safe haven for sea vessels because of its natural deepwater harbour , protected by the Pelican Point sand spit , being the only natural harbour of any size along the country 's coast . Being rich in plankton and marine life , these waters also drew large numbers of southern right whales , attracting whalers and fishing vessels . The Dutch referred to it as Walvisch Baye and the English as Whale Bay . In its eventual formal incorporation , it was named Walfish Bay , which was changed to Walvish Bay , and ultimately to Walvis Bay . It has also been referred to as Walwich Bay or Walwisch Bay . The Herero people of the area called it Ezorongondo . A succession of colonists developed the location and resources of this strategic harbour settlement . The harbour 's value in relation to the sea route around the Cape of Good Hope had caught the attention of world powers since it was discovered by the outside world in 1485 .

Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia , straddling the Bosporus strait ( which separates Europe and Asia ) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea . Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives in suburbs on the Asian side of the Bosporus . With a total population of around 15 million residents in its metropolitan area , Istanbul is one of the world 's most populous cities , ranking as the world 's fifth-largest city proper and the largest European city . The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality ( coterminous with Istanbul Province ) . Founded under the name of Byzantion ( \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ) on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660 BCE , the city grew in size and influence , becoming one of the most important cities in history . After its reestablishment as Constantinople in 330 CE , it served as an imperial capital for almost 16 centuries , during the Roman/Byzantine ( 330-1204 ) , Latin ( 1204-1261 ) , Palaiologos Byzantine ( 1261-1453 ) and Ottoman ( 1453-1922 ) empires . It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times , before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 CE and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate . Under the name Constantinople it was the Ottoman capital until 1923 . The capital was then moved to Ankara and the city was renamed Istanbul .

Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power .",

Although the recognition accorded them was less in comparison with the adulation given Charles Lindbergh for his transatlantic flight only five weeks earlier , Maitland and Hegenberger 's feat was arguably more significant from a navigational stand point . Maitland continued his career in the Air Corps , serving in combat as a bombardment group commander during World War II .

A Republican lawyer from New England , born in Vermont , Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics , eventually becoming governor of Massachusetts . His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action . The next year , he was elected vice president of the United States , and he succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923 . Elected in his own right in 1924 , he gained a reputation as a small government conservative and also as a man who said very little and had a rather dry sense of humor . Coolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor 's administration , and left office with considerable popularity . As a Coolidge biographer wrote : He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class , could interpret their longings and express their opinions . That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength . Scholars have ranked Coolidge in the lower half of those presidents that they have assessed . He is praised by advocates of smaller government and laissez-faire economics , while supporters of an active central government generally view him less favorably , although most praise his stalwart support of racial equality .",
  "/wiki/Charles_Lindbergh": "Charles Augustus Lindbergh ( February 4 , 1902 - August 26 , 1974 ) was an American aviator , military officer , author , inventor , and activist . At age 25 in 1927 , he went from obscurity as a U.S. Air Mail pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the Orteig Prize for making a nonstop flight from New York to Paris . Lindbergh covered the \u200b33 1\u20442-hour , 3,600-statute-mile ( 5,800 km ) flight alone in a purpose-built , single-engine Ryan monoplane , the Spirit of St. Louis . Although not the first non-stop transatlantic flight , this was the first solo transatlantic flight , the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs , and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles , thus it is widely known as a turning point in the trajectory of aviation history and advancement . Lindbergh was an officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve , and he received the United States ' highest military decoration , the Medal of Honor , for his transatlantic flight . His achievement spurred interest in both commercial aviation and air mail , which revolutionized the aviation industry , and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity . Lindbergh 's historic flight and celebrity status also led to tragedy . In March 1932 , his infant son , Charles Jr. , was kidnapped and murdered in what the American media called the Crime of the Century . The case prompted the United States Congress to establish kidnapping as a federal crime once the kidnapper had crossed state lines with their victim . By late 1935 , the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe , from which they returned in 1939 . Before the United States entered World War II , Lindbergh was an advocate of non-interventionism and a supporter of Nazi Germany . He opposed not only the intervention of the United States , but also the granting of aid to the United Kingdom .",
