  "/wiki/Traditional_Japanese_Music": "Traditional Japanese music or \u90a6\u697d ( h\u014dgaku ) , meaning literally ( home ) country music ( as opposed to \u6d0b\u697d ( y\u014dgaku ) - Western music ) is the folk or traditional music of Japan . Japan 's Ministry of Education classifies H\u014dgaku as a category separate from other traditional forms of music , such as Gagaku ( court music ) or Sh\u014dmy\u014d ( Buddhist chanting ) , but most ethnomusicologists view H\u014dgaku , in a broad sense , as the form from which the others were derived . Outside of ethnomusicology , however , H\u014dgaku usually refers to Japanese music from around the 17th to the mid-19th century . Within this framework , there are three types of traditional music in Japan : theatrical , court music ( called gagaku ) , and instrumental .",
  "/wiki/Biwa": "The biwa ( \u7435\u7436 ) is a Japanese short-necked fretted lute , often used in narrative storytelling . The biwa is the chosen instrument of Benten , goddess of music , eloquence , poetry , and education in Japanese Buddhism.The biwa is a plucked string instrument that was first popular in China and then spread throughout East Asia . It is said to have arrived in Japan from China during the Nara period ( 710 - 794 ) , and is even thought to have roots that trace back to Persia . It is generally 60 - 106cm in length and made from wood . The instrument consists of a water-drop-shaped body with a handle , and while there are generally four strings , five-stringed varieties also exist . In Japan , the biwa is generally plucked with a bachi instead of the fingers , and is often used to play gagaku . In addition , it is used as musical accompaniment when blind monks recite scriptural texts , or when reciting The Tale of the Heike , a war chronicle from the Kamakura era ( 1185 - 1333 ) . The origin of the biwa is the Chinese pipa . It arrived in Japan in two forms . Since that time , the number of biwa types has more than quadrupled . Guilds supporting biwa players , particularly the biwa hoshi , helped proliferate biwa musical development for hundreds of years . Biwa h\u014dshi performances overlapped with performances by other biwa players many years before heikyoko and continues to this day .",

It is played with a plectrum called a bachi . The Japanese pronunciation is usually shamisen but sometimes jamisen when used as a suffix , according to regular sound change ( e.g . tsugaru-jamisen ) . It is samisen in western Japan and in several Edo-period sources . The construction of the shamisen varies in shape , depending on the genre in which it is used . The instrument used to accompany kabuki has a thin neck , facilitating the agile and virtuosic requirements of that genre . The one used to accompany puppet plays and folk songs has a longer and thicker neck instead , to match the more robust music of those genres .",
