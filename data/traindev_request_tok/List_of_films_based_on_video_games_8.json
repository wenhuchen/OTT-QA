Even common actions like hand-shaking and saying hello may be termed as rituals . The field of ritual studies has seen a number of conflicting definitions of the term . One given by Kyriakidis is that a ritual is an outsider 's or etic category for a set activity ( or set of actions ) that , to the outsider , seems irrational , non-contiguous , or illogical . The term can be used also by the insider or emic performer as an acknowledgement that this activity can be seen as such by the uninitiated onlooker . In psychology , the term ritual is sometimes used in a technical sense for a repetitive behavior systematically used by a person to neutralize or prevent anxiety ; it can be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder but obsessive-compulsive ritualistic behaviors are generally isolated activities .",
