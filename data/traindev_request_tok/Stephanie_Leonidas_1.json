The UK edition retailed at twelve shillings and sixpence ( 12/6 ) and the US edition at $ 2.95 . A crucial witness is unaware of his role as such until two years after a man is found guilty of a murder . When he realizes the information he holds , he re-opens the pain of loss in a family , and re-opens the question of who was the murderer two years ago . This novel received mixed reviews at the time of publication , as reviewers were not generally comfortable with the psychological aspects of the story . The plot had her customary ingenuity but lacked blitheness and was much too like an attempt at psychological fiction . Sympathy is evoked for too many characters , but the unravelling is sound and the story well told . Another said there is ingenuity and a good ending , but the plot lacks a central focus and it appears that the serious socio-psychological approach does n't suit Christie 's writing . A later review considered it one of the better Christie novels of the 1950s , and noted that the author sometimes called it her own favourite .",
