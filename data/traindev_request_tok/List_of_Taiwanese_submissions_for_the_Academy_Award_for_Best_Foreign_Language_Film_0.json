The ceremony was produced by MGM 's Joe Pasternak and hosted , for the 14th time , by Bob Hope . The awards show was a star-studded one , including an appearance by Judy Garland , who sang a medley of Cole Porter songs in tribute to the composer , who had died in October 1964 .

  "/wiki/A_Brighter_Summer_Day": "A Brighter Summer Day is a 1991 Taiwanese epic coming-of-age drama film directed by Edward Yang and is considered by most to be a masterpiece of contemporary cinema . The film is an extraordinarily large project for a Chinese-language film , not only for its duration of almost four hours , but also for its involvement of more than 100 amateur actors in different roles . The English title is derived from the lyrics of Elvis Presley 's Are You Lonesome Tonight ? . The film was selected as the Taiwanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 64th Academy Awards but was not nominated . The film addresses a great array of human-centred themes such as the eager search for guidance during adolescence , the angst resulting from social detachment , the everyday hardships of parenthood , the pursuit of a satisfying individual and collective identity together with the ennui and frustration prompted by failing to do so , the volatility of young love and friendships , the self-aggrandising tendencies commonplace in teenage-made myths , and , especially , the fatal and irreversible consequences of an aimless life and a bewildering upbringing . Edward Yang also tackles highly sensitive political issues like the rise of Western culture to the detriment of Taiwan 's traditions , the wide-spreading of unrest and violence stirred by socio-political uneasiness , the strained coexistence among social classes trying to deal with an uncertain future , the consequent yearn of migrating towards an expectedly-better country , and the proliferation of self-ruled quasi-political organisations ( in this case , youth gangs ) as a way to substitute an unconvincing State .",
