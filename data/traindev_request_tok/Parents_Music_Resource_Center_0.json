He signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19 , and released his debut album For You in 1978 . Following up with his next four albums - Prince ( 1979 ) , Dirty Mind ( 1980 ) , Controversy ( 1981 ) , and 1999 ( 1982 ) - Prince gained critical success , prominently showcasing his explicit lyrics as well as his blending of funk , dance , and rock music .

The song failed to chart well in Easton 's native UK . It was composed by Alexander Nevermind , a pseudonym used by Prince . The song title is presumed to be a euphemism for the lining of her vagina , which was perhaps sufficiently subtle by itself , but the general content was considered suggestive enough to qualify the song for the Filthy Fifteen . Although Easton 's music video for Sugar Walls did not in itself feature any controversial visual content , some broadcasters refused the video airplay because of the sexual imagery of the song 's lyrics . Televangelist Jimmy Swaggart and Tipper Gore 's PMRC criticized the song when it was first released . Sugar Walls was released on April 13 , 2019 as a 12 inch single picture disc by RT Industries for 2019 National Record Store Day .",

The band 's best-selling album is 1982 's Screaming for Vengeance , with their most commercially successful line-up featuring Hill , Halford , Tipton , guitarist K. K. Downing , and drummer Dave Holland . Tipton and Hill are the only two members of the band to appear on every album .
