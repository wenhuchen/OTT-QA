  "/wiki/And_the_Band_Played_On": "And the Band Played On : Politics , People , and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle journalist Randy Shilts . The book chronicles the discovery and spread of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting - specifically in the United States - to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease . Shilts ' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen : while the disease is caused by a biological agent , incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse . The book is an extensive work of investigative journalism , written in the form of an encompassing time line ; the events that shaped the epidemic are presented as sequential matter-of-fact summaries . Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay , medical , and political communities . Shilts begins his discussion in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS , that of Grethe Rask , a Danish doctor working in Africa . He ends with the announcement by actor Rock Hudson in 1985 that he was dying of AIDS , when international attention on the disease exploded . And the Band Played On was critically acclaimed and became a best-seller . Judith Eannarino of the Library Journal called it one of the most important books of the year , upon its release . It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community . He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release , saying , Any good reporter could have done this story , but I think the reason I did it , and no one else did , is because I am gay . It was happening to people I cared about and loved .",
