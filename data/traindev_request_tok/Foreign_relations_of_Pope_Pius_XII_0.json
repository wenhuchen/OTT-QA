  "/wiki/Nuncio": "An apostolic nuncio ( also known as a papal nuncio or simply as a nuncio ) is an ecclesiastical diplomat , serving as an envoy or a permanent diplomatic representative of the Holy See to a state or to an international organization . A nuncio is appointed by and represents the Holy See , and is the head of the diplomatic mission , called an Apostolic Nunciature , which is the equivalent of an embassy . The Holy See is legally distinct from the Vatican City or the Catholic Church . A nuncio is usually an archbishop . An apostolic nuncio is generally equivalent in rank to that of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary , although in Catholic countries the nuncio often ranks above ambassadors in diplomatic protocol . A nuncio performs the same functions as an ambassador and has the same diplomatic privileges . Under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations , to which the Holy See is a party , a nuncio is an ambassador like those from any other country . The Vienna Convention allows the host state to grant seniority of precedence to the nuncio over others of ambassadorial rank accredited to the same country , and may grant the deanship of that country 's diplomatic corps to the nuncio regardless of seniority . The representative of the Holy See in some situations is called a Delegate or , in the case of the United Nations , Permanent Observer . In the Holy See hierarchy , these usually rank equally to a nuncio , but they do not have formal diplomatic status , though in some countries they have some diplomatic privileges . In addition , the nuncio serves as the liaison between the Holy See and the Church in that particular nation , supervising the diocesan episcopate ( usually a national conference of bishops which has its own chairman , usually the highest-ranking bishop or archbishop , especially if his seat carries the title of primate or he has individually been created a cardinal ) and has an important role in the selection of bishops .",
