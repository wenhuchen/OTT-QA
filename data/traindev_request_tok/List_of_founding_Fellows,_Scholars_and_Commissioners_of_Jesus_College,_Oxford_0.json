  "/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester": "The Bishop of Winchester is the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Winchester in the Church of England . The bishop 's seat ( cathedra ) is at Winchester Cathedral in Hampshire . During the Middle Ages , it was one of the wealthiest English sees , and its bishops have included a number of politically prominent Englishmen , notably the 9th century Saint Swithun and medieval magnates including William of Wykeham and Henry of Blois . The Bishop of Winchester is appointed by the Crown , and is one of five Church of England bishops who sit ex officio among the 26 Lords Spiritual in the House of Lords , regardless of their length of service . The Diocese of Winchester is one of the oldest and most important in England . Originally it was the episcopal see of the kingdom of Wessex or the West Saxons , with its cathedra at Dorchester Cathedral under Saints Birinus and Agilbert . The cathedral at Dorchester was founded in AD 634 by Birinius , a Roman missionary . The see was transferred to Winchester in AD 660 . Winchester was divided in AD 909 , with Wiltshire and Berkshire transferring to the new See of Ramsbury . Nevertheless , the domains of the Bishop of Winchester ran from the south coast to the south bank of the River Thames at Southwark , where the bishop had one of his palaces , making it one of the largest as well as one of the richest sees in the land . In more modern times , the former extent of the Diocese of Winchester was reduced by the formation of a new diocese of Southwark in south London , a new diocese of Guildford in Surrey and a new diocese of Portsmouth in Hampshire . The most recent loss of territory was in 2014 when the Channel Islands were removed from the diocese of Winchester after a dispute with Bishop Tim Dakin led to a breakdown in relations .",
  "/wiki/King_James_Bible": "The King James Version ( KJV ) , also known as the King James Bible ( KJB ) or simply the Authorized Version ( AV ) , is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England , begun in 1604 and completed as well as published in 1611 under the sponsorship of James VI and I . [ a ] [ b ] The books of the King James Version include the 39 books of the Old Testament , an intertestamental section containing 14 books of the Apocrypha , and the 27 books of the New Testament . Noted for its majesty of style , the King James Version has been described as one of the most important books in English culture and a driving force in the shaping of the English-speaking world . It was first printed by John Norton & Robert Barker , both the King 's Printer , and was the third translation into English approved by the English Church authorities : The first had been the Great Bible , commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII ( 1535 ) , and the second had been the Bishops ' Bible , commissioned in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I ( 1568 ) . In Geneva , Switzerland the first generation of Protestant Reformers had produced the Geneva Bible of 1560 from the original Hebrew and Greek scriptures , which was influential in the writing of the Authorized King James Version . In January 1604 , King James convened the Hampton Court Conference , where a new English version was conceived in response to the problems of the earlier translations perceived by the Puritans , a faction of the Church of England . James gave the translators instructions intended to ensure that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology of , and reflect the episcopal structure of , the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy . The translation was done by 6 panels of translators ( 47 men in all , most of whom were leading biblical scholars in England ) who had the work divided up between them : the Old Testament was entrusted to three panels , the New Testament to two , and the Apocrypha to one . In common with most other translations of the period , the New Testament was translated from Greek , the Old Testament from Hebrew and Aramaic , and the Apocrypha from Greek and Latin . In the Book of Common Prayer ( 1662 ) , the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible for Epistle and Gospel readings ( but not for the Psalter , which substantially retained Coverdale 's Great Bible version ) , and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament . By the first half of the 18th century , the Authorized Version had become effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and English Protestant churches , except for the Psalms and some short passages in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England . Over the course of the 18th century , the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English-speaking scholars .",
