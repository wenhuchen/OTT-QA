He also excelled in horsemanship , water polo , running , rowing and cricket . However , His stature as an athlete depends largely upon the enormous range rather than the outstanding excellence of his activities ; it was as an entrepreneur-showman , publicist and businessman that he seems in retrospect to have been most important . Baker retired from competition after being injured in a motor-vehicle accident , and became involved in boxing promotion , bringing a number of top fighters from North America and Europe to fight in Australia . During this time , he began to act in a number of silent film roles which showcased his horsemanship , including The Enemy Within , The Man from Kangaroo , and The Shadow of Lightning Ridge . In 1920 , Baker left Australia for the United States , where he became known as an entrepreneur and stunt coach . He died in 1953 in Los Angeles , California , from cerebrovascular disease .",
