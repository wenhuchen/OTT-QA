  "/wiki/Niagara_Falls": "Niagara Falls /na\u026a\u02c8\u00e6\u0261r\u0259 , na\u026a\u02c8\u00e6\u0261\u0259r\u0259/ is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge , spanning the border between the US state of New York and the Canadian province of Ontario . The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls , also known as Canadian Falls , which straddles the international border between Canada and the United States . The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie entirely within the United States . Bridal Veil Falls are separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island and from American Falls by Luna Island , with both islands situated in New York as well . Located on the Niagara River , which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario , the combined falls have the highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . During peak daytime tourist hours , more than 168,000 m3 ( six million cubic feet ) of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute . Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful waterfall in North America , as measured by flow rate . The falls are 27 kilometres ( 17 mi ) north-northwest of Buffalo , New York , and 121 kilometres ( 75 mi ) south-southeast of Toronto , between the twin cities of Niagara Falls , Ontario , and Niagara Falls , New York . Niagara Falls was formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation ( the last ice age ) , and water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean . Niagara Falls is famed both for its beauty and as a valuable source of hydroelectric power . Balancing recreational , commercial , and industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 19th century .",
  "/wiki/Niagara_River": "The Niagara River ( /na\u026a\u02c8\u00e6\u0261\u0259r\u0259/ ny-AG-\u0259r-\u0259 ) is a river that flows north from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario . It forms part of the border between the province of Ontario in Canada ( on the west ) and the state of New York in the United States ( on the east ) . There are differing theories as to the origin of the river 's name . According to Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger , Niagara is derived from the name given to a branch of the locally residing native Neutral Confederacy , who are described as being called the Niagagarega people on several late-17th-century French maps of the area . According to George R. Stewart , it comes from the name of an Iroquois town called Ongniaahra , meaning point of land cut in two . The river , which is occasionally described as a strait , is about 58 kilometres ( 36 mi ) long and includes Niagara Falls in its course . The falls have moved approximately 11 kilometres ( 6.8 mi ) upstream from the Niagara Escarpment in the last 12,000 years , resulting in a gorge below the falls . Today , the diversion of the river for electrical generation has significantly reduced the rate of erosion . The total drop in elevation along the river is 99 metres ( 325 ft ) . The Niagara Gorge extends downstream from the Falls and includes the Niagara Whirlpool and another section of rapids . Power plants on the river include the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Stations ( built in 1922 and 1954 ) on the Canadian side , and the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant ( built in 1961 ) on the American side . Together , they generate 4.4 gigawatts of electricity .",
  "/wiki/Horseshoe_Falls": "Horseshoe Falls , also known as Canadian Falls , is the largest of the three waterfalls that collectively form Niagara Falls on the Niagara River along the Canada-United States border . Approximately 90% of the Niagara River , after diversions for hydropower generation , flows over Horseshoe Falls . The remaining 10% flows over American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls . It is located between Terrapin Point on Goat Island in the US state of New York , and Table Rock in the Canadian province of Ontario .",
  "/wiki/Bridal_Veil_Falls_(Manitoulin_Island)": "Bridal Veil Falls is a waterfall near the town of Kagawong on Lake Huron 's Manitoulin Island , Ontario , Canada . The water source is the Kagawong River which flows from Lake Kagawong to the North Channel of Lake Huron . It has a height of approximately 35 feet ( 11 m ) . There is a short hiking trail from the falls down to the North Channel . There are two parking lots and two approaches to the falls : one from the top of the outdoor steel staircase next to the falls , and another from a few hundred yards down the trail , past some of the rapids . Both are easily accessible from Highway 540 .",
  "/wiki/Kagawong_River": "The Kagawong River is a river on Manitoulin Island in Manitoulin District , Ontario , Canada which flows from Lake Kagawong to empty into Mudge Bay on the North Channel Lake Huron . The river falls over a limestone bluff at Bridal Veil Falls . Kagawong means mists rising from falling water in the Ojibwe language . The Kagawong River consists of two parts . The first , at the level of Lake Kagawong , flows in an easterly direction out of the Lake reaching and passes under Highway 540 just above Bridal Veil Falls . The river is navigable by canoe , kayak , paddleboat and other shallow draft boats . Canoes and kayaks can be rented nearby , and there is a casual launch facility for trailerable boats . The lower Kagawong River below Bridal Veil Falls is fast flowing and shallow , and is therefore not navigable by boat . However , a viewing platform and a riverside walk give visual access to the Falls and provide a river walk down to the downtown area of Kagawong , and the harbour . The river is especially interesting in late September - mid October , when there is a salmon run of thousands of fish .",

  "/wiki/Ottawa_River": "The Ottawa River ( French : Rivi\u00e8re des Outaouais , Algonquin : Kitchissippi ) is a river in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec . It is named in honour of the Algonquin word 'to trade ' , as it was the major trade route of Eastern Canada at the time . For most of its length , it defines the border between these two provinces . It is a major tributary of the St. Lawrence River and the longest river in Quebec .",
  "/wiki/Chaudi\u00e8re_Falls": "The Chaudi\u00e8re Falls , also known as the Kana : tso or Akikodjiwan Falls , are a set of cascades and waterfall in the centre of the Ottawa-Gatineau metropolitan area in Canada where the Ottawa River narrows between a rocky escarpment on both sides of the river . The location is just west of the Chaudi\u00e8re Bridge and Booth-Eddy streets corridor , northwest of the Canadian War Museum at LeBreton Flats and adjacent to the historic industrial E. B. Eddy complex . The islands surrounding the Chaudi\u00e8re Falls , counter-clockwise , are Chaudi\u00e8re Island ( immediately to the South & East of the falls ) , Albert Island ( to the South ) , little Coffin Island was just south of Albert Island but is now submerged , Victoria Island and Amelia Island , ( which was separated from Victoria Island in 1836 by Government timber slide ; now fused to Victoria Island ) , Philemon Island ( to the North ) was originally called the Peninsular Village by the Wrights but became an island when the timber slide was built in 1829 ( some maps identify it as Wright Island , but that is incorrect ) it is now fused to south shore of City of Gatineau , and Russell Island , now submerged , was at the head of the Falls before the Ring dam was built . The falls are about 60 metres ( 200 ft ) wide and drop 15 metres ( 49 ft ) . The area around the falls was once heavily industrialized , especially in the 19th century , driving growth of the surrounding cities . The Chaudi\u00e8re name was given to the falls by Samuel de Champlain , an early French explorer who noted in a 1613 journal entry that the Indigenous word for the falls was Asticou meaning boiler , but 'Asticou ' is now thought to be a misprint as the Algonquin ( Anishinaabemowin ) word for boiler/cauldron is Akikok , and an Algonquin name for the location is Akikodjiwan . The European name comes from the French Chutes de la Chaudi\u00e8re , meaning Cauldron Falls , historically translated as Kettle Falls . The shape of the falls before its development resembled a large kettle , better known to today 's English speakers as a cauldron . William S. Hunter Jr. suggested a different origin for the name in 1855 : The Word Chaudiere is the literal translation into French of the Indian ( sic ) word Kanajo ( The Kettle ) , and is . . . vastly suggestive , for the chasm into which the waters of the Ottawa ( Ottawa River ) discharge themselves is not unlike a kettle in shape , while the seething and frothing of the surface , in its continual whirl , assists in completing the resemblance , though Hunter himself provides no reference , historical or otherwise , to contradict de Champlain 's account of the naming of the falls .",
  "/wiki/Fenelon_Falls,_Ontario": "Fenelon Falls is a village in Ontario , Canada , part of the city of Kawartha Lakes . Nicknamed the Jewel of the Kawarthas , it has a population of 1,800 permanent inhabitants , which swells in the summer due to tourism and cottaging . Fenelon Falls is home to lock 34 on the Trent-Severn Waterway between Sturgeon Lake and Cameron Lake . It is primarily a tourist town and therefore is most active during the summer season . The main street of Fenelon Falls is called Colborne Street . The eponymous falls are hidden from plain view , because the main road crosses over the river just upstream ; however , the falls are easily viewed from a nearby restaurant or from a path on the north band of the Fenelon River . The falls power a hydro-electric dam , which diverts some of the water flow .",
  "/wiki/Trent-Severn_Waterway": "The Trent-Severn Waterway is a 386-kilometre-long canal route ( 240 miles ) connecting Lake Ontario at Trenton to Georgian Bay , Lake Huron , at Port Severn . Its major natural waterways include the Trent River , Otonabee River , Kawartha Lakes , Lake Simcoe , Lake Couchiching and Severn River . Its scenic , meandering route has been called one of the finest interconnected systems of navigation in the world . The canal was surveyed as a military route , but the first lock was built in 1833 as a commercial venture . This connected a number of lakes and rivers near the centre of the waterway , opening a large area to navigation by steamship . The government had begun construction of three additional locks when the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837 broke out . This led the government to re-examine the project , concluding that the route would have too many locks to allow rapid movement for military purposes . They decided that the locks under construction would be completed , but the rest could be turned into timber slides . This left the completed inland section with no outlet , which business interests addressed by connecting to the route with a number of new toll roads , plank roads , and later , railways . John A. Macdonald 's government restarted construction in the 1880s , adding a number of new locks and pushing the route westward before construction once again halted . For many years after this , the canal was used as a political tool to garner votes from areas along the route , with little construction being carried out . It was not until just before the turn of the century that a number of political changes built up incredible pressure on Wilfrid Laurier 's Liberals and serious work started once again .",

  "/wiki/Hog's_Back_Falls": "The Hog 's Back Falls , officially known as the Prince of Wales Falls , but rarely referred to by this name , are a series of artificial waterfalls on the Rideau River in Ottawa , Ontario , Canada . The falls are located just north of Mooney 's Bay and the point where the Rideau Canal splits from the Rideau River . Prior to the construction of the Rideau Canal , these were a gentle set of rapids originally known as Three Rock Rapids . The name Hog 's Back came into use shortly before canal construction . Civil Engineer John MacTaggart , in 1827 , described them as a noted ridge of rocks , called the Hogs Back , from the circumstances of raftsmen with their wares [ timber rafts ] sticking on it in coming down the stream . These rapids were about 600 metres ( 2 000 feet ) in length with a drop of about 1.8 metres ( 6 feet ) . They were navigable by canoe , no portage was required .",
  "/wiki/Rideau_River": "The Rideau River ( French : Rivi\u00e8re Rideau ) , ( Anishin\u00e0bemowin name : Pasapkedjinawong ) is a river in Eastern Ontario , Canada . The river flows north from Upper Rideau Lake and empties into the Ottawa River at the Rideau Falls in Ottawa , Ontario . Its length is 146 kilometres ( 91 mi ) . The river was given the name Rideau ( curtain ) by Champlain , as he wrote in 1613 , because of the appearance of the Rideau Falls . The Anishin\u00e0bemowin name for the river is Pasapkedjinawong , meaning the river that passes between the rocks . The Rideau Canal , which allows travel from Ottawa to the city of Kingston , Ontario on Lake Ontario , was formed by joining the Rideau River with the Cataraqui River . The river diverges from the Canal at Hog 's Back Falls in Ottawa . In early spring , to reduce flooding on the lower section of the river , workers from the city of Ottawa use ice blasting to clear the ice which covers the river from Billings Bridge to Rideau Falls by cutting keys through the ice and using explosives to break off large sheets of ice . This practice has been going on for more than 100 years . The regulatory authority charged with protecting the Rideau River and its tributaries is the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority .",
