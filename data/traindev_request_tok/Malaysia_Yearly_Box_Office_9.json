  "/wiki/The_Jungle_Book": "The Jungle Book ( 1894 ) is a collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling . Most of the characters are animals such as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear , though a principal character is the boy or man-cub Mowgli , who is raised in the jungle by wolves . The stories are set in a forest in India ; one place mentioned repeatedly is Seonee ( Seoni ) , in the central state of Madhya Pradesh . A major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering , as in the life of Mowgli , echoing Kipling 's own childhood . The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal over their enemies , as well as Mowgli 's . Another important theme is of law and freedom ; the stories are not about animal behaviour , still less about the Darwinian struggle for survival , but about human archetypes in animal form . They teach respect for authority , obedience , and knowing one 's place in society with the law of the jungle , but the stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds , such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village . Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories , reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature . The Jungle Book has remained popular , partly through its many adaptations for film and other media . Critics such as Swati Singh have noted that even critics wary of Kipling for his supposed imperialism have admired the power of his storytelling . The book has been influential in the scout movement , whose founder , Robert Baden-Powell , was a friend of Kipling 's . Percy Grainger composed his Jungle Book Cycle around quotations from the book .",
