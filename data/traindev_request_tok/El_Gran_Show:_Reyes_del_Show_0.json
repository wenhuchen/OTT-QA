  "/wiki/Bullfighter": "A bullfighter is a performer in the art of bullfighting . Torero ( Spanish : [ to\u02c8\u027ee\u027eo ] ) or toureiro ( Portuguese : [ to\u02c8\u027e\u0250j\u027eu ] ) ( both from Latin taurarius , bullfighter ) are the Spanish and Portuguese words for bullfighter and describe all the performers in the sport of bullfighting as practised in Spain , Portugal , Mexico , Peru , France , Colombia , Ecuador , Venezuela and other countries influenced by Portuguese and Spanish culture . The main performer and leader of the entourage in a bullfight , and who finally kills the bull , is addressed as maestro ( master ) , or with the formal title matador de toros ( killer of bulls ) . The other bullfighters in the entourage are called subalternos and their suits are embroidered in silver as opposed to the matador 's more-theatrical gold . They include the picadores , rejoneadores , and banderilleros . In English , a torero is sometimes referred to by the term toreador , which was popularized by Georges Bizet in his opera Carmen . In Spanish , the word designates bullfighters on horseback , but is little used today , having been almost entirely displaced by rejoneador . A very small number of women have been bullfighters on foot or on horseback ; one recent example is Cristina S\u00e1nchez . Female matadors have experienced considerable resistance and public hostility from some aficionados and other matadors . Usually , toreros start fighting younger bulls ( novillos or , more informally in some Latin American countries , vaquillas ) , and are called novilleros . Fighting of mature bulls commences only after a special match , called the Alternative . At this same bullfight , the novillero ( junior bullfighter ) is presented to the crowd as a matador de toros .",
