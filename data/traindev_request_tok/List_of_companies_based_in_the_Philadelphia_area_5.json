  "/wiki/Conrail": "Conrail ( formally the Consolidated Rail Corporation , with reporting mark CR ) was the primary Class I railroad in the Northeastern United States between 1976 and 1999 . The trade name Conrail is a portmanteau based on the company 's legal name , and while it no longer operates trains , it continues to do business as an asset management and network services provider in three Shared Assets Areas that were excluded from the division of its operations during its acquisition by CSX Corporation and the Norfolk Southern Railway . The Federal Government created Conrail to take over the potentially-profitable lines of multiple bankrupt carriers , including the Penn Central Transportation Company and Erie Lackawanna Railway . After railroad regulations were lifted by the 4R Act and the Staggers Act , Conrail began to turn a profit in the 1980s and was privatized in 1987 . The two remaining Class I railroads in the East , CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway ( NS ) , agreed in 1997 to acquire the system and split it into two roughly-equal parts ( alongside three residual shared-assets areas ) , returning rail freight competition to the Northeast by essentially undoing the 1968 merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad that created Penn Central . Following approval by the Surface Transportation Board , CSX and NS took control in August 1998 , and on June 1 , 1999 , began operating their respective portions of Conrail . The old company remains a jointly-owned subsidiary , with CSX and NS owning respectively 42 percent and 58 percent of its stock , corresponding to how much of Conrail 's assets they acquired .

  "/wiki/International_Mercantile_Marine_Company": "The International Mercantile Marine Company , originally the International Navigation Company , was a trust formed in the early twentieth century as an attempt by J.P.

Bruce Ismay of the White Star Line , and John Ellerman of the Leyland Line . The Dominion Line was also amalgamated . The project was bankrolled by J.P. Morgan & Co. , led by financier J. P. Morgan . The company also had working profit-sharing relationships with the German Hamburg-Amerika and the North German Lloyd lines . The trust caused great concern in the British shipping industry and led directly to the British government 's subsidy of the Cunard Line 's new ships RMS Lusitania and RMS Mauretania in an effort to compete . IMM was a holding company that controlled subsidiary corporations that had their own subsidiaries . Morgan hoped to dominate transatlantic shipping through interlocking directorates and contractual arrangements with the railroads , but that proved impossible because of the nature of sea transport , American antitrust legislation , and an agreement with the British government . One of IMM 's subsidiaries was the White Star Line , which owned the RMS Titanic . Analysis of financial records shows that IMM was overleveraged and suffered from inadequate cash flow that caused it to default on bond interest payments in late 1914 . As a result , a friendly receivership was put in effect in 1915 , which allowed IMM to reorganize its finances ; it emerged from the receivership in 1916 . Saved by World War I , IMM eventually re-emerged , after a merger with Roosevelt Steamship Company , as the United States Lines , which itself went bankrupt in 1986 .",
