  "/wiki/Balto": "Balto ( 1919 - March 14 , 1933 ) was a Siberian Husky and sled dog who led his team on the final leg of the 1925 serum run to Nome , in which diphtheria antitoxin was transported from Anchorage , Alaska , to Nenana , Alaska , by train and then to Nome by dog sled to combat an outbreak of the disease .

After he died , his body was mounted and kept in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History , where it remains today .",
  "/wiki/Balto_(film)": "Balto is a 1995 American-British live-action/animated adventure film directed by Simon Wells , produced by Amblin Entertainment and distributed by Universal Pictures . The film is loosely based on a true story about the dog of the same name who helped save children infected by the diphtheria epidemic in the 1925 serum run to Nome . The film stars Kevin Bacon , Bridget Fonda , Jim Cummings , Phil Collins ( in a dual role ) and Bob Hoskins , with Miriam Margolyes in the live-action sequences . The live-action portions of the film were shot in New York City 's Central Park . The film was the third and final animated feature produced by Steven Spielberg 's UK-based Amblimation animation studio . Spielberg , Kathleen Kennedy and Bonne Radford acted as executive producers on the film . Although the film was a financial disappointment ( it was overshadowed by the success of the competing Disney-Pixar film Toy Story ) its subsequent strong sales on home video led to two direct-to-video sequels : Balto II : Wolf Quest ( 2002 ) and Balto III : Wings of Change ( 2004 ) , though none of the voice cast reprised their roles . Unlike the original film , the sequels were entirely animated and contain no live action scenes .",
  "/wiki/Nome,_Alaska": "Nome ( /\u02c8no\u028am/ ; Inupiaq : Siqnazuaq IPA : [ siqn\u0250zu\u0251q ] ) is a city in the Nome Census Area in the Unorganized Borough of Alaska , United States . The city is located on the southern Seward Peninsula coast on Norton Sound of the Bering Sea . In 2018 the population was estimated at 3,866 , a rise from the 3,598 recorded in the 2010 Census , up from 3,505 in 2000 . Nome was incorporated on April 9 , 1901 , and was once the most-populous city in Alaska . Nome lies within the region of the Bering Straits Native Corporation , which is headquartered in Nome . The city of Nome claims to be home to the world 's largest gold pan , although this claim has been disputed by the Canadian city of Quesnel , British Columbia . In the winter of 1925 , a diphtheria epidemic raged among Alaska Natives in the Nome area . Fierce territory-wide blizzard conditions prevented the delivery of a life-saving serum by aeroplane from Anchorage . A relay of dog sled teams was organized to deliver the serum .",
  "/wiki/Dingo": "The dingo ( scientific name : Canis dingo , taxonomic classification : Canis familiaris , Canis familiaris dingo , Canis lupus dingo , or Canis dingo ) is a dog that is found in Australia . Its taxonomic classification is debated . It is a medium-sized canine that possesses a lean , hardy body adapted for speed , agility , and stamina . The dingo 's three main coat colours are : light ginger or tan , black and tan , or creamy white . The skull , the widest part of the dingo , is wedge-shaped and large in proportion to the body . It differs from that of the domestic dog by its larger palatal width , longer rostrum , shorter skull height , and wider sagittal crest . The earliest known dingo fossil , found in Western Australia , dates to 3,450 years ago , which led to the presumption that dingoes came to Australia with seafarers prior to that time , possibly from south-west Sulawesi in modern-day Indonesia . Dingo morphology has not changed over the past 3,500 years : this suggests that no artificial selection has been applied over this period . The dingo is closely related to the New Guinea singing dog : their lineage split early from the lineage that led to today 's domestic dogs , and can be traced back through the Malay Archipelago to Asia . A recent genetic study shows that the lineage of those dingoes found today in the northwestern part of the Australian continent split from the lineage of the New Guinea singing dog and southeastern dingo 6,300 BC , followed by a split between the New Guinea singing dog lineage from the southeastern dingo lineage 5,800 BC . The study proposes that two dingo migrations occurred when sea levels were lower and Australia and New Guinea formed one landmass named Sahul that existed until 6,500-8,000 years ago . The dingo 's habitat covers most of Australia , but they are absent in the southeast and Tasmania , a strip on the northeastern coast , and an area in the southwest ( see map ) .",

  "/wiki/Black-backed_jackal": "The black-backed jackal ( Canis mesomelas ) is a canid native to eastern and southern Africa . These regions are separated by roughly 900 kilometers . One region includes the southernmost tip of the continent , including South Africa , Namibia , Botswana , and Zimbabwe . The other area is along the eastern coastline , including Kenya , Somalia , Djibouti , Eritrea , and Ethiopia . It is listed by the IUCN as least concern , due to its widespread range and adaptability , although it is still persecuted as a livestock predator and rabies vector . Compared to other members of the genus Canis , the black-backed jackal is a very ancient species , and has changed little since the Pleistocene , being the most basal wolf-like canine , alongside the closely related side-striped jackal . It is a fox-like animal with a reddish coat and a black saddle that extends from the shoulders to the base of the tail . It is a monogamous animal , whose young may remain with the family to help raise new generations of pups . The black-backed jackal is not a fussy eater , and feeds on small to medium-sized animals , as well as plant matter and human refuse .",
  "/wiki/African_wild_dog": "The African wild dog ( Lycaon pictus ) is a canid native to sub-Saharan Africa . It is the largest indigenous canid in Africa , and the only extant member of the genus Lycaon , which is distinguished from Canis by dentition highly specialised for a hypercarnivorous diet , and a lack of dewclaws . It was classified as endangered by the IUCN in 2016 , as it had disappeared from much of its original range . The last official assessment was carried out in 2012 and the population was estimated at 39 subpopulations containing 6,600 adults , of which 1,400 were reproductive . The population of mature adults as per the IUCN in 2020 , is 1409 . The decline of these populations is ongoing , due to habitat fragmentation , human persecution and disease outbreaks . The African wild dog is a highly social animal , living in packs with separate dominance hierarchies for males and females . Uniquely among social carnivores , the females rather than the males disperse from the natal pack once sexually mature . The young are allowed to feed first on carcasses . The species is a specialised diurnal hunter of antelopes , which it catches by chasing them to exhaustion . Like other canids , the African wild dog regurgitates food for its young , but this action is also extended to adults , to the point of being central to their social life . Its natural enemies are lions and hyenas : the former will kill the canids where possible whilst hyenas are frequent kleptoparasites .",
