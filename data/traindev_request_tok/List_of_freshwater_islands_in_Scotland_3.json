It takes its name from the County of Aberdeen which has substantially different boundaries . The Aberdeenshire council area includes all of the area of the historic counties of Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire ( except the area making up the City of Aberdeen ) , as well as part of Banffshire . The county boundaries are officially used for a few purposes , namely land registration and lieutenancy . Aberdeenshire Council is headquartered at Woodhill House , in Aberdeen , making it the only Scottish council whose headquarters are located outside its jurisdiction . Aberdeen itself forms a different council area ( Aberdeen City ) . Aberdeenshire borders onto Angus and Perth and Kinross to the south , Highland and Moray to the west and Aberdeen City to the east . Traditionally , it has been economically dependent upon the primary sector ( agriculture , fishing , and forestry ) and related processing industries . Over the last 40 years , the development of the oil and gas industry and associated service sector has broadened Aberdeenshire 's economic base , and contributed to a rapid population growth of some 50% since 1975 . Its land represents 8% of Scotland 's overall territory . It covers an area of 6,313 square kilometres ( 2,437 sq mi ) .",

In its upper reaches peaty water flows over a bottom of shingle and rock and is fast flowing . The river has its source in the Ladder Hills between Glenbuchat and the Cabrach , part of the Grampian range . It begins as a small highland stream among peaty and heather covered country before leaving the hills and entering the rolling lowlands of fertile farmland . The two main streams in its upper course are the Alt Deveron and the Black Water . Some 17 miles downstream from the river 's source , the river passes through the town of Huntly , where it is joined by its tributary , the River Bogie . Four miles further downstream the Deveron 's second tributary , the River Isla flows in from the northwest . From this point on the Deveron becomes a mature river , pursuing a winding course through Turriff and finally flowing into the Moray Firth between the twin towns of Banff and Macduff . The Deveron is the dark-rolling stream Duvranna of James Macpherson 's Ossian .",

The River Cree provided a route from the coast into the forested hinterland . Then it became the boundary between communities living on either side , dividing the County , or Shire , of Wigtownshire from the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright . It also divides the parish of Penninghame from the parish of Minnigaff and the town of Newton Stewart from the villages of Creebridge and Minnigaff , thus identifying a variety of administrative entities . There were very few bridges until the 18th century and tolls and local customs duties could be levied at such crossing points . The Cree was also the source of power for the textile mills built in Newton Stewart in the 18th century when water power was a key element in industrial development . Most of the time , the Cree is fordable and the old site of the main ford , just below the present bridge , is still detectable in the street layout of Newton Stewart . The location of the first , wooden bridge and the boat ferry are still identifiable local landmarks just to the north of the present bridge . A new steel bridge , the Sparling Bridge , was strung across the river downstream of the Town Bridge in 1998 as part of an attractive riverside walk .

For part of this time , the castle and the lordship of Galloway were controlled by Princess Margaret , daughter of King Robert III and widow of the 4th Earl . In 1449 Threave was regained by the 8th earl , Scotland 's most powerful magnate , who controlled extensive lands and numerous castles . He fortified Threave with an artillery house , a sophisticated defence for its time . The excessive power of the Black Douglas lords led to their overthrow by King James II in 1455 , after which Threave was besieged and captured by the King 's men . It became a royal castle , and in the 16th century hereditary responsibility for Threave was given to the Lords Maxwell . It was briefly held by the English in the 1540s , but did not see serious action until the Bishops ' Wars , when in 1640 a royalist garrison was besieged by a force of Covenanters . Partially dismantled , the castle remained largely unused until given into state care in 1913 . The ruins , comprising the substantially complete tower house and the L-shaped artillery house , are today maintained by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument .
