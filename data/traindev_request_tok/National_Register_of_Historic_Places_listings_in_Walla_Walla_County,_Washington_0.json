  "/wiki/Italianate": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",
  "/wiki/Stick_Style": "The Stick style was a late-19th-century American architectural style , transitional between the Carpenter Gothic style of the mid-19th century , and the Queen Anne style that it had evolved into by the 1890s .

  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

  "/wiki/Renaissance_Revival": "Renaissance Revival architecture ( sometimes referred to as Neo-Renaissance ) is a group of 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Greek Revival nor Gothic Revival but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes . Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism ; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque . Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century : Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate , or when many French Baroque features are present ( Second Empire ) . The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe , particularly in France and Italy , has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture . A comparison between the breadth of its source material , such as the English Wollaton Hall , Italian Palazzo Pitti , the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , and the Russian Palace of Facets - all deemed Renaissance - illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take .",

  "/wiki/Shingle_Style": "The Shingle style is an American architectural style made popular by the rise of the New England school of architecture , which eschewed the highly ornamented patterns of the Eastlake style in Queen Anne architecture . In the Shingle style , English influence was combined with the renewed interest in Colonial American architecture which followed the 1876 celebration of the Centennial . The plain , shingled surfaces of colonial buildings were adopted , and their massing emulated . Aside from being a style of design , the style also conveyed a sense of the house as continuous volume . This effect - of the building as an envelope of space , rather than a great mass , was enhanced by the visual tautness of the flat shingled surfaces , the horizontal shape of many Shingle style houses , and the emphasis on horizontal continuity , both in exterior details and in the flow of spaces within the houses .",
