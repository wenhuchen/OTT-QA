  "/wiki/Fossil_Hominid_Sites_of_South_Africa": "The paleoanthropological site called the Cradle of Humankind is located about 50 km ( 31 mi ) northwest of Johannesburg , South Africa , in the Gauteng province . Declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1999 , the site currently occupies 47,000 hectares ( 180 sq mi ) and contains a complex of limestone caves . The registered name of the site in the list of World Heritage sites is Fossil Hominid Sites of South Africa . According to existing archaeological and fossil evidence , the Cradle of Humankind is the Horn of Africa and along with East Africa it is often referred to as the Cradle of Humanity . The Sterkfontein Caves were the site of the discovery of a 2.3-million-year-old fossil Australopithecus africanus ( nicknamed Mrs. Ples ) , found in 1947 by Robert Broom and John T. Robinson . The find helped corroborate the 1924 discovery of the juvenile Australopithecus africanus skull known as the Taung Child , by Raymond Dart , at Taung in the North West Province of South Africa , where excavations still continue . Nearby , but not in the site , the Rising Star Cave system contains the Dinaledi Chamber ( chamber of stars ) , in which were discovered fifteen fossil skeletons of an extinct species of hominin , provisionally named Homo naledi . Sterkfontein alone has produced more than a third of early hominid fossils ever found prior to 2010 . The Dinaledi Chamber contains over 1,500 H. naledi fossils , the most extensive discovery of a single hominid species ever found in Africa .",

The archaeological sites of Swartkrans and Kromdraai are in the same area . Sterkfontein is a South African National Heritage Site and was also declared a World Heritage Site in 2000 . The area in which it is situated is known as the Cradle of Humankind . The Sterkfontein Caves are also home to numerous wild African species including Belonogaster petiolata , a wasp species of which there is a large nesting presence . Numerous early hominin remains have been found at the site over the last few decades . These have been attributed to Australopithecus , early Homo and Paranthropus .",

It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era . The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch . Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale , which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene , the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage , which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago , and is now included in the Pleistocene . As with other older geologic periods , the geological strata that define the start and end are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain . The boundaries defining the Pliocene are not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer Miocene and the relatively cooler Pliocene .

The end of the Pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the Paleolithic age used in archaeology . The Pleistocene is the first epoch of the Quaternary Period or sixth epoch of the Cenozoic Era . In the ICS timescale , the Pleistocene is divided into four stages or ages , the Gelasian , Calabrian , Chibanian , and Upper Pleistocene ( unofficially the Tarantian ) . [ note 1 ] In addition to these international subdivisions , various regional subdivisions are often used . Before a change finally confirmed in 2009 by the International Union of Geological Sciences , the time boundary between the Pleistocene and the preceding Pliocene was regarded as being at 1.806 million years Before Present ( BP ) , as opposed to the currently accepted 2.58 million years BP .

The province was formed from the northern region of Transvaal Province in 1994 , and was initially named Northern Transvaal . The following year , it was renamed Northern Province , which remained the name until 2003 , when it was formally changed to Limpopo after deliberation by the provincial government and amendment of the South African Constitution . An alternate name considered for the province was Mapungubwe . The Northern Ndebele people traditionally are the majority in the province . However , majority of them now speak Sepedi which is a home language for the Sekhukhune district .

The term Limpopo is derived from Rivombo ( Livombo/Lebombo ) , a group of Tsonga settlers led by Hosi Rivombo who settled in the mountainous vicinity and named the area after their leader . The river is approximately 1,750 kilometres ( 1,087 mi ) long , with a drainage basin 415,000 square kilometres ( 160,200 sq mi ) in size . The mean discharge measured over a year is 170 m3/s ( 6,200 cu ft/s ) at its mouth . The Limpopo is the second largest river in Africa that drains to the Indian Ocean , after the Zambezi River . [ citation needed ] The first European to sight the river was Vasco da Gama , who anchored off its mouth in 1498 and named it Espiritu Santo River . Its lower course was explored by St Vincent Whitshed Erskine in 1868-69 , and Captain J F Elton travelled down its middle course in 1870 . The drainage area of Limpopo River has decreased over geological time . Up to Late Pliocene or Pleistocene times the upper course of Zambezi River drained into the Limpopo River . The change of the drainage divide is the result of epeirogenic movement that uplifted the surface north of present-day Limpopo River diverting waters into Zambezi River .",

The area ranges in altitude from sea level , to 1,377 m ( 4,518 ft ) at Cornellberg . Located in the north-eastern side of the Northern Cape province in South Africa , the Richtersveld is regarded as the only arid biodiversity hotspot on earth and the majority of the area is inscribed on UNESCO 's World Heritage List due to its cultural values . The Nama people of Richtersveld claimed title to their traditional land and set aside this conservancy for future research and tourism . The northern part of the area was proclaimed in 1991 after 18 years of negotiations between the National Parks Board and the local Nama people who continue to live and graze their livestock in the area . It has an area of 1,624.45 square kilometres ( 627.20 sq mi ) .

  "/wiki/Coral_reefs": "A coral reef is an underwater ecosystem characterized by reef-building corals . Reefs are formed of colonies of coral polyps held together by calcium carbonate . Most coral reefs are built from stony corals , whose polyps cluster in groups . Coral belongs to the class Anthozoa in the animal phylum Cnidaria , which includes sea anemones and jellyfish . Unlike sea anemones , corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons that support and protect the coral . Most reefs grow best in warm , shallow , clear , sunny and agitated water . Coral reefs first appeared 485 million years ago , at the dawn of the Early Ordovician , displacing the microbial and sponge reefs of the Cambrian . Sometimes called rainforests of the sea , shallow coral reefs form some of Earth 's most diverse ecosystems . They occupy less than 0.1% of the world 's ocean area , about half the area of France , yet they provide a home for at least 25% of all marine species , including fish , mollusks , worms , crustaceans , echinoderms , sponges , tunicates and other cnidarians . Coral reefs flourish in ocean waters that provide few nutrients . They are most commonly found at shallow depths in tropical waters , but deep water and cold water coral reefs exist on smaller scales in other areas . Coral reefs deliver ecosystem services for tourism , fisheries and shoreline protection .",
