Built primarily in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century , the FEC was a project of Standard Oil principal Henry Flagler . He originally visited Florida with his first wife , Mary ; they sought assistance with the health issues she faced . A key strategist who worked closely with John D. Rockefeller building the Standard Oil Trust , Flagler noted both great potential and a lack of services during his stay at St. Augustine . He subsequently began what amounted to his second career , developing resorts , industries , and communities all along Florida 's shores abutting the Atlantic Ocean . The FEC is possibly best known for building the railroad to Key West , completed in 1912 .

However , a greater and lasting Flagler legacy was the developments along Florida 's eastern coast . During the Great Depression , control was purchased by heirs of the du Pont family . After 30 years of fragile financial condition , the FEC , under leadership of a new president , Ed Ball , took on the labor unions . Ball claimed the company could not afford the same costs as larger Class 1 railroads and needed to invest saved funds in its infrastructure , the condition of which was fast becoming a safety issue .",
