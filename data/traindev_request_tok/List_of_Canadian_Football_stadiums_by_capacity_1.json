People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area , located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers , deep ravines , and urban forest , for more than 10,000 years . After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase , when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown , the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada . During the War of 1812 , the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops . York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto . It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation . The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 ( 243.3 sq mi ) .

French colonist Samuel de Champlain landed at Saint John Harbour on June 24 , 1604 ( the feast of St. John the Baptist ) and is where the Saint John River gets its name although Mi'kmaq and Maliseet peoples lived in the region for thousands of years prior calling the river Wolastoq . The Saint John area was an important area for trade and defence for Acadia during the French colonial era and Fort La Tour , in the city 's harbour , was a pivotal battleground during the Acadian Civil War . After over a century of ownership disputes over the land surrounding Saint John between the French and English , the English deported the French colonists in 1755 and constructed Fort Howe above the harbour in 1779 . In 1785 , the City of Saint John was established by uniting the two towns of Parrtown and Carleton on each side of the harbour after the arrival of thousands of refugees from the American Revolution who wished to remain British and were forced to leave their U.S. homes . Over the next century , waves of immigration via Partridge Island , especially during the Great Famine , would fundamentally change the city 's demographics and culture .",

The French settlers were later displaced when the area became part of the British Empire . In 1784 , after an influx of refugees from the American Revolutionary War , the province was partitioned from Nova Scotia . In 1785 Saint John became Canada 's first incorporated city .

The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province .
