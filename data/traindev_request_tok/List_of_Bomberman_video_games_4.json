It was released in Japan on October 30 , 1987 and in the United States on August 29 , 1989 . The Japanese model was imported and distributed in France in 1989 and United Kingdom and Spain received a version based on the American model known as simply TurboGrafx . It was the first console released in the 16-bit era , although it used a modified 8-bit CPU . In Japan , the system was launched as a competitor to the Famicom but the delayed United States release meant that it ended up competing with the Sega Genesis and later on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . The TurboGrafx-16 has an 8-bit CPU , a 16-bit video color encoder , and a 16-bit video display controller . The GPUs are capable of displaying 482 colors simultaneously , out of 512 . With dimensions of just 14 cm \u00d7 14 cm \u00d7 3.8 cm ( 5.5 in \u00d7 5.5 in \u00d7 1.5 in ) , the Japanese PC Engine is the smallest major home game console ever made . Games were released on HuCard cartridges or later the CD-ROM optical format with the TurboGrafx-CD add-on . The TurboGrafx-16 failed to break into the North American market and sold poorly , which has been blamed on the delayed release and inferior marketing . Despite the 16 in its name and the marketing of the console as a 16-bit platform , it used an 8-bit CPU , a marketing tactic that was criticized by some as deceptive . Developer Doug Snook of ICOM Simulations said the team struggled with the relative low performance of the CPU .",

It was the first system in SNK 's Neo Geo family . The Neo Geo was marketed as 24-bit ; its CPU is technically a 16/32-bit 68000-based system with an 8/16-bit Z80 coprocessor , while its GPU chipset has a 24-bit graphics data bus . The Neo Geo originally launched as the MVS ( Multi Video System ) coin-operated arcade machine . The MVS offers owners the ability to put up to six different cartridges into a single cabinet , a unique feature that was also a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace , as well as saving money long-term . With its games stored on self-contained cartridges , a game cabinet can be exchanged for a different game title by swapping the game 's ROM cartridge and cabinet artwork . A home console version was also made , called AES ( Advanced Entertainment System ) . It was originally launched as a rental console for video game stores in Japan ( called Neo Geo Rental System ) , with its high price causing SNK not to release it for home use - this was later reversed due to high demand and it came into the market as a luxury console . The AES had the same raw specs as the MVS and had full compatibility , thus managed to bring a true arcade experience to home users . The Neo Geo was revived along with the brand overall in December 2012 through the introduction of the Neo Geo X handheld and home system . The Neo Geo was a very powerful system when released , more powerful than any video game console at the time , and many arcade systems such as rival Capcom 's CPS , which did not surpass it until the CP System II in 1993 . The Neo Geo MVS was a success during the 1990s due to the cabinet 's low cost , six ROM slots , and compact size .",

The first playable version was completed on June 6 , 1984 , while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Moscow .

  "/wiki/Personal_computer": "A personal computer ( PC ) is a multi-purpose computer whose size , capabilities , and price make it feasible for individual use . Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user , rather than by a computer expert or technician . Unlike large costly minicomputers and mainframes , time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers . Institutional or corporate computer owners in the 1960s had to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines . While personal computer users may develop their own applications , usually these systems run commercial software , free-of-charge software ( freeware ) , which is most often proprietary , or free and open-source software , which is provided in ready-to-run , or binary , form . Software for personal computers is typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or operating system manufacturers . Many personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any use of a personal computer , although end-user programming is still feasible . This contrasts with mobile systems , where software is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel , and end-user program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer . Since the early 1990s , Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware dominated much of the personal computer market , first with MS-DOS and then with Microsoft Windows . Alternatives to Microsoft 's Windows operating systems occupy a minority share of the industry . These include Apple 's macOS and free and open-source Unix-like operating systems .

Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold .

The successor to the successful Sega Genesis , the Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors . Its games are in CD-ROM format , and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original games . Development of the Saturn began in 1992 , the same year Sega 's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted . The system was designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi . Sega added another video display processor in early 1994 to better compete with Sony 's forthcoming PlayStation . The Saturn was initially successful in Japan , but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch , four months before its scheduled release date . After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996 , the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S. , where it was discontinued in 1998 . Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure . The failure of Sega 's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , known in development as Sonic X-treme , has been considered a factor in the console 's poor performance . Although the Saturn is remembered for several well regarded games , including Nights into Dreams , the Panzer Dragoon series , and the Virtua Fighter series , its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support . Sega 's management has been criticized for its decisions during the system 's development and discontinuation .",

  "/wiki/Fighting_game": "A fighting game is a video game genre based around close combat between a limited number of characters , in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed . The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires . The matches typically consist of several rounds , in an arena , with each player character having different abilities but each is relatively viable to choose . Players must master techniques such as blocking , counter-attacking , and chaining attacks together into combos . Starting in the early 1990s , most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations . The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups , which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player . The first game to feature fist fighting was Heavyweight Champ in 1976 , but it was Karate Champ which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in arcades in 1984 . The following year , Yie Ar Kung-Fu featured antagonists with differing fighting styles , while The Way of the Exploding Fist further popularized the genre on home systems . In 1987 , Street Fighter introduced hidden special attacks . In 1991 , Capcom 's highly successful Street Fighter II refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre . The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s , particularly in arcades . This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games , including franchises like Street Fighter , Super Smash Bros. , Tekken , and Virtua Fighter .",
