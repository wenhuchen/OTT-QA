  "/wiki/St._Joan_of_Arc": "Joan of Arc ( French : Jeanne d'Arc pronounced [ \u0292an da\u0281k ] ; c. 1412 - 30 May 1431 ) , nicknamed The Maid of Orl\u00e9ans ( French : La Pucelle d'Orl\u00e9ans ) , is considered a heroine of France for her role during the Lancastrian phase of the Hundred Years ' War , and was canonized as a Roman Catholic saint . She was born to Jacques d'Arc and Isabelle Rom\u00e9e , a peasant family , at Domr\u00e9my in northeast France . Joan claimed to have received visions of the archangel Michael , Saint Margaret , and Saint Catherine of Alexandria instructing her to support Charles VII and recover France from English domination late in the Hundred Years ' War . The unanointed King Charles VII sent Joan to the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans as part of a relief army . She gained prominence after the siege was lifted only nine days later . Several additional swift victories led to Charles VII 's consecration at Reims . This long-awaited event boosted French morale and paved the way for the final French victory . On 23 May 1430 , she was captured at Compi\u00e8gne by the Burgundian faction , a group of French nobles allied with the English . She was later handed over to the English and put on trial by the pro-English bishop Pierre Cauchon on a variety of charges . After Cauchon declared her guilty , she was burned at the stake on 30 May 1431 , dying at about nineteen years of age . In 1456 , an inquisitorial court authorized by Pope Callixtus III examined the trial , debunked the charges against her , pronounced her innocent , and declared her a martyr . In the 16th century she became a symbol of the Catholic League , and in 1803 she was declared a national symbol of France by the decision of Napoleon Bonaparte .",
