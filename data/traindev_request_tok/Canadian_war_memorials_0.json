It is home to the nation 's capital city , Ottawa , and the nation 's most populous city , Toronto , which is also Ontario 's provincial capital . Ontario is bordered by the province of Manitoba to the west , Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north , and Quebec to the east and northeast , and to the south by the U.S. states of ( from west to east ) Minnesota , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New York . Almost all of Ontario 's 2,700 km ( 1,678 mi ) border with the United States follows inland waterways : from the westerly Lake of the Woods , eastward along the major rivers and lakes of the Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence River drainage system . These include Rainy River , Pigeon River , Lake Superior , St. Marys River , Lake Huron , St. Clair River , Lake St. Clair , Detroit River , Lake Erie , Niagara River , Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River from Kingston , Ontario , to the Quebec boundary just east of Cornwall , Ontario . There is only about 1 km ( 0.6 mi ) of land border , made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border . Ontario is sometimes conceptually divided into two regions , Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario . The great majority of Ontario 's population and arable land is in the south .

  "/wiki/War_of_1812": "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom , with their respective allies , from June 1812 to February 1815 . Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars ; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right . From the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France , Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France , which the US contested as illegal under international law . To man the blockade , Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy . American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , which happened five years before the war . The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811 , in which 11 British sailors died . Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier , hindering American expansion and provoking resentment . Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America ( Canada ) contributed to the American decision to go to war . However , the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British . On June 18 , 1812 , President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war , after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress . With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon , Britain adopted a defensive strategy , with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier . American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity , especially in New England , where it was referred to as Mr. Madison 's War .",

On November 11 , 1813 , the Battle of Crysler 's Farm , at which a British force repelled an invading American army , took place near what was later to be called Morrisburg . United Empire Loyalist settlers settled in Dundas County creating West Williamsburg and was part of the Williamsburg Canal project . Between 1843 and 1856 , canals were built on the north side of the St. Lawrence River . West Williamsburg was renamed Morrisburg in 1851 in honour of Brockville , Ontario politician , James Morris , who was named the first Postmaster General of the United Province of Canada . Incorporated as a village in 1860 , Morrisburg had a growing manufacturing base consisting of a gristmill , a carding mill and a fanning mill . The Grand Trunk Railroad reached Morrisburg in 1855 . Eventually a power station was built on the St. Lawrence River . During the 1950s , portions of Morrisburg were relocated because of expected flooding caused by the St. Lawrence Seaway project . Over 80 homes were moved and the entire downtown business district was demolished and relocated in a shopping plaza . The Canadian National Railway line was moved 1.1 kilometers north of its original location . Much of the former railbed was used for reconstructing Ontario Highway 2 .",

It is part of the densely populated Quebec City-Windsor Corridor and is approximately halfway between Montreal and Quebec City . Trois-Rivi\u00e8res is the economic and cultural hub of the Mauricie region . The settlement was founded by French colonists on July 4 , 1634 , as the second permanent settlement in New France , after Quebec City in 1608 . The city 's name , which is French for 'three rivers ' , is named for the fact the Saint-Maurice River has three mouths at the Saint Lawrence River ; it is divided by two islands in the river .

A British army under Quebec Governor Guy Carleton defeated an attempt by units from the Continental Army under the command of Brigadier General William Thompson to stop a British advance up the Saint Lawrence River valley . The battle occurred as a part of the American colonists ' invasion of Quebec , which had begun in September 1775 with the goal of removing the province from British rule . The crossing of the Saint Lawrence by the American troops was observed by Quebec militia , who alerted British troops at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res . A local farmer led the Americans into a swamp , enabling the British to land additional forces in the village , and to establish positions behind the American army . After a brief exchange between an established British line and American troops emerging from the swamp , the Americans broke into a somewhat disorganized retreat . As some avenues of retreat were cut off , the British took a sizable number of prisoners , including General Thompson and much of his staff .

  "/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War": "The American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) , also known as the American War of Independence , was fought primarily between the Kingdom of Great Britain and her Thirteen Colonies in America ; it resulted in the overthrow of British rule in the colonies and the establishment of the United States of America . [ N 1 ] After 1765 , growing constitutional and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies . Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts , which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor . Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts Bay Colony . Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves , and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown . Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress ( with the exception of Georgia ) to coordinate their resistance , establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power . British attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in Concord led to open combat and a British defeat on April 19 , 1775 . Militia forces then besieged Boston , forcing a British evacuation in March 1776 , and Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army . Concurrently , the Americans failed decisively in an attempt to invade Quebec and raise insurrection against the British . On July 2 , 1776 , the Second Continental Congress voted for independence , issuing its declaration on July 4 . Sir William Howe launched a British counter-offensive , capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb .

As of the 2016 census , Regina had a city population of 215,106 , and a Metropolitan Area population of 236,481 . It is governed by Regina City Council . The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No . 159 . Regina was previously the seat of government of the North-West Territories , of which the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta originally formed part , and of the District of Assiniboia . The site was previously called Wascana ( Buffalo Bones in Cree ) , but was renamed to Regina ( Latin for Queen ) in 1882 in honour of Queen Victoria . This decision was made by Queen Victoria 's daughter Princess Louise , who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada , the Marquess of Lorne . Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West , on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off , Wascana Creek . Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 260-metre ( 850 ft ) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake . Regina 's importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906 .",

In 1784 , New Brunswick was partitioned from the Colony of Nova Scotia after significant loyalist resettlement around the Bay of Fundy . The influx of loyalist refugees also resulted in the Province of Quebec 's division into Lower Canada ( present-day Quebec ) , and Upper Canada ( present-day Ontario ) in 1791 . The Crown gave them land grants of one Lot . One Lot contains 200 acres ( 81 ha ) per person to encourage their resettlement , as it especially wanted to develop the frontier of Upper Canada .

The son of a distinguished general , Edward Wolfe , he received his first commission at a young age and saw extensive service in Europe where he fought during the War of the Austrian Succession . His service in Flanders and in Scotland , where he took part in the suppression of the Jacobite Rebellion , brought him to the attention of his superiors . The advancement of his career was halted by the Peace Treaty of 1748 and he spent much of the next eight years on garrison duty in the Scottish Highlands . Already a brigade major at the age of 18 , he was a lieutenant-colonel by 23 . The outbreak of the Seven Years ' War in 1756 offered Wolfe fresh opportunities for advancement . His part in the aborted raid on Rochefort in 1757 led William Pitt to appoint him second-in-command of an expedition to capture the Fortress of Louisbourg . Following the success of the Siege of Louisbourg he was made commander of a force which sailed up the Saint Lawrence River to capture Quebec City . After a long siege Wolfe defeated a French force under the Marquis de Montcalm , allowing British forces to capture the city . Wolfe was killed at the height of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham due to injuries from three musket balls . Wolfe 's part in the taking of Quebec in 1759 earned him lasting fame , and he became an icon of Britain 's victory in the Seven Years ' War and subsequent territorial expansion .

The battle , which began on 13 September 1759 , was fought on a plateau by the British Army and Royal Navy against the French Army , just outside the walls of Quebec City on land that was originally owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin , hence the name of the battle . The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops in total , but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between France and Britain over the fate of New France , influencing the later creation of Canada . The culmination of a three-month siege by the British , the battle lasted about an hour . British troops commanded by General James Wolfe successfully resisted the column advance of French troops and Canadian militia under General Louis-Joseph , Marquis de Montcalm , employing new tactics that proved extremely effective against standard military formations used in most large European conflicts . Both generals were mortally wounded during the battle ; Wolfe received three gunshot wounds that ended his life within minutes of the beginning of the engagement and Montcalm died the next morning after receiving a musket ball wound just below his ribs . In the wake of the battle , the French evacuated the city , and their remaining military force in Canada and the rest of North America came under increasing pressure from British forces . The decisive success of the British forces and the subsequent capture of Quebec was part of what became known as the Annus Mirabilis in Great Britain .

With the Act of Union 1840 , Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada . Later , with Confederation in 1867 , the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the Province of Canada to form Canada , which was subsequently divided into four provinces : Ontario , Quebec , New Brunswick and Nova Scotia . A number of other British colonies , such as Newfoundland and British Columbia , and large territories such as Rupert 's Land , initially remained outside the newly formed federation . Over time , the remaining colonies and territories of British North America were joined to Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949 . Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs , Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament , until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 . This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada , which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Canada 's final vestige of legislative dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act , subsequently providing Canada with full legal legislative sovereignty independent of the United Kingdom .",

With a population of 923,598 as of 2016 , it is the most populous of Canada 's three Maritime provinces and the four Atlantic provinces . It is the country 's second most-densely populated province and second-smallest province by area , both after neighbouring Prince Edward Island . Its area of 55,284 square kilometres ( 21,345 sq mi ) includes Cape Breton Island and 3,800 other coastal islands . The peninsula that makes up Nova Scotia 's mainland is connected to the rest of North America by the Isthmus of Chignecto , on which the province 's land border with New Brunswick is located . The province borders the Bay of Fundy to the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and east , and is separated from Prince Edward Island and the island of Newfoundland by the Northumberland and Cabot straits , respectively . The land that comprises what is now Nova Scotia has been inhabited by the indigenous Mi\ua78ckmaq people for thousands of years . France 's first settlement in North America , Port-Royal , was established in 1605 and intermittently served in various locations as the capital of the French colony of Acadia for over a hundred years . The Fortress of Louisbourg was a key focus point in the struggle between the British and French for control of the area , changing hands numerous times in the until France relinquished its claims with the Treaty of Paris in 1763 . During the American Revolutionary War , thousands of Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia . In 1848 , Nova Scotia became the first British colony to achieve responsible government , and it federated in July 1867 with New Brunswick and the Province of Canada ( now Ontario and Quebec ) to form what is now the country of Canada . Nova Scotia 's capital and largest city is Halifax , which is today home to about 45 per cent of the province 's population , is the thirteenth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada , the largest city in Atlantic Canada , and Canadas second largest coastal city ( after Vancouver ) .",
  "/wiki/Privateer": "A privateer is a private person or ship that engages in maritime warfare under a commission of war . Since robbery under arms was a common aspect of seaborne trade , until the early 19th century all merchant ships carried arms . A sovereign or delegated authority issued commissions , also referred to as a letter of marque , during wartime . The commission empowered the holder to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war . This included attacking foreign vessels and taking them as prizes , and taking prize crews as prisoners for exchange . Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under prize law , with the proceeds divided by percentage between the privateer 's sponsors , shipowners , captains and crew . A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission ( i.e . the sovereign ) . Privateering allowed sovereigns to raise revenue for war by mobilizing privately owned armed ships and sailors to subsidize state power . For participants , privateering provided the potential for a greater income and profit than obtainable as a merchant seafarer or fisher . However , this incentive increased the risk of privateers turning to piracy when war ended . The commission usually protected privateers from accusations of piracy but in practice , the historical legality and status of privateers could be vague .",

Kingston is nicknamed the Limestone City because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone . Growing European exploration in the 17th century , and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade , led to the founding of a French trading post and military fort at a site known as Cataraqui ( generally pronounced kah-tah-ROCK-way ) in 1673 . This outpost , called Fort Cataraqui , and later Fort Frontenac , became a focus for settlement . Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort , and Loyalists began settling the region in the 1780s . Kingston was named the first capital of the United Province of Canada on February 10 , 1841 .

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",

It is the only monument to the Crimean War in North America . The arch and lion were built in 1860 by stone sculptor George Lang to commemorate British victory in the Crimean war and the Nova Scotians who had fought in the war .

'Eastern War ' ; Turkish : K\u0131r\u0131m Sava\u015f\u0131 ; Italian : Guerra di Crimea ) was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to February 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance made up of the Ottoman Empire , France , Britain and Sardinia . The immediate cause of the war involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land , which was a part of the Ottoman Empire . The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics , while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church . The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at the Ottoman Empire 's expense . It has widely been noted that the causes , in one case involving an argument over a key , have never revealed a greater confusion of purpose , yet they led to a war noted for its notoriously incompetent international butchery . While the churches worked out their differences and came to an agreement , Nicholas I of Russia and the French Emperor Napoleon III refused to back down . Nicholas issued an ultimatum that the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire be placed under his protection . Britain attempted to mediate and arranged a compromise that Nicholas agreed to . When the Ottomans demanded changes to the agreement , Nicholas recanted and prepared for war . Having obtained promises of support from France and Britain , the Ottomans declared war on Russia in October 1853 . The war started in the Balkans in July 1853 , when Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities ( now part of Romania ) , which were under Ottoman suzerainty , then began to cross the Danube .",

Montcalm was born near N\u00eemes in France to a noble family , and entered military service early in life . He saw service in the War of the Polish Succession and the War of the Austrian Succession , where his distinguished service led to promotion to brigadier general . In 1756 King Louis XV sent him to New France to lead its defence against the British in the Seven Years ' War . Montcalm met with notable successes in 1756 , 1757 and 1758 , but British mobilisation of large numbers of troops against New France led to military setbacks in 1758 and 1759 ( when , in January , he was promoted to lieutenant general ) , culminating in Montcalm 's death at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham . Montcalm 's service in New France was marked by conflict between himself and the Governor General of the colony , Pierre de Rigaud , Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial . These men were the leaders of the war effort in New France during the Seven Years ' War .
