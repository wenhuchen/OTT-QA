  "/wiki/Regional_county_municipality": "The term regional county municipality or RCM ( French : municipalit\u00e9 r\u00e9gionale de comt\u00e9 , MRC ) is used in Quebec to refer to one of 87 county-like political entities . In some older English translations they were called county regional municipality . Regional county municipalities are a supralocal type of regional municipality , and act as the local municipality in unorganized territories within their borders . The system of regional county municipalities was introduced beginning in 1979 to replace the historic counties of Quebec . In most cases , the territory of an RCM corresponds to that of a census division , however there are a few exceptions . Some local municipalities are outside any regional county municipality ( hors MRC ) . This includes some municipalities within urban agglomerations and also some aboriginal lands , such as Indian reserves that are enclaves within the territory of an RCM but not juridically part of it . Where complete territorial coverage is desired , for example for the census , the Indian reserve enclaves are added in to create geographical RCMs , and the urban agglomerations are considered to be territories equivalent to an RCM . For a list of RCMs and equivalent territories , see List of regional county municipalities and equivalent territories in Quebec .",
