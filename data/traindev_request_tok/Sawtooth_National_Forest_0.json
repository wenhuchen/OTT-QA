  "/wiki/Mountain_Range": "A mountain range or hill range is a series of mountains or hills ranged in a line and connected by high ground . A mountain system or mountain belt is a group of mountain ranges with similarity in form , structure , and alignment that have arisen from the same cause , usually an orogeny . Mountain ranges are formed by a variety of geological processes , but most of the significant ones on Earth are the result of plate tectonics . Mountain ranges are also found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets . Mountain ranges are usually segmented by highlands or mountain passes and valleys . Individual mountains within the same mountain range do not necessarily have the same geologic structure or petrology . They may be a mix of different orogenic expressions and terranes , for example thrust sheets , uplifted blocks , fold mountains , and volcanic landforms resulting in a variety of rock types .",
  "/wiki/Topographic_elevation": "The elevation of a geographic location is its height above or below a fixed reference point , most commonly a reference geoid , a mathematical model of the Earth 's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface ( see Geodetic datum \u00a7 Vertical datum ) . The term elevation is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth 's surface , while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface , such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit , and depth is used for points below the surface . Elevation is not to be confused with the distance from the center of the Earth . Due to the equatorial bulge , the summits of Mount Everest and Chimborazo have , respectively , the largest elevation and the largest geocentric distance .",
  "/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system": "A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers , letters or symbols . [ note 1 ] The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position and two or three of the numbers represent a horizontal position ; alternatively , a geographic position may be expressed in a combined three-dimensional Cartesian vector . A common choice of coordinates is latitude , longitude and elevation . To specify a location on a plane requires a map projection .",
