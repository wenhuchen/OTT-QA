After attending private schools and the University of Oxford , he practised as a barrister . The volunteer work he carried out in London 's East End exposed him to poverty and his political views shifted leftwards thereafter . He joined the Independent Labour Party , gave up his legal career , and began lecturing at the London School of Economics . His work was interrupted by service as an officer in the First World War . In 1919 , he became mayor of Stepney and in 1922 was elected Member of Parliament for Limehouse . Attlee served in the first Labour minority government led by Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 , and then joined the Cabinet during MacDonald 's second minority ( 1929-1931 ) . After retaining his seat in Labour 's landslide defeat of 1931 , he became the party 's Deputy Leader .

  "/wiki/Modern_History": "The history of the world , in common parlance , is the history of humanity ( or human history ) , as determined from archeology , anthropology , genetics , linguistics , and other disciplines ; and , for periods since the invention of writing , from recorded history and from secondary sources and studies . Humanity 's written history was preceded by its prehistory , beginning with the Palaeolithic Era ( Old Stone Age ) , followed by the Neolithic Era ( New Stone Age ) . The Neolithic saw the Agricultural Revolution begin , between 8000 and 5000 BCE , in the Near East 's Fertile Crescent . During this period , humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals . As agriculture advanced , most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements . The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units , fostered by advances in transportation . Whether in prehistoric or historic times , people always needed to be near reliable sources of potable water . Settlements developed on river banks as early as 3000 BCE in Mesopotamia , on the banks of Egypt 's Nile River , in the Indus River valley , and along China 's rivers . As farming developed , grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons . Labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities , which provided the foundation for civilization . The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing . With civilizations flourishing , ancient history ( Antiquity , including the Classical Age , up to about 500 CE ) saw the rise and fall of empires .",

  "/wiki/Law": "Law is commonly understood as a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate conduct , although its precise definition is a matter of longstanding debate . It has been variously described as a science and the art of justice . State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator , resulting in statutes , by the executive through decrees and regulations , or established by judges through precedent , normally in common law jurisdictions . Private individuals can create legally binding contracts , including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process . The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution , written or tacit , and the rights encoded therein . The law shapes politics , economics , history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people . Legal systems vary between countries , with their differences analysed in comparative law . In civil law jurisdictions , a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates the law . In common law systems , judges make binding case law through precedent , although on occasion case law may be overturned by a higher court or the legislature . Historically , religious law influenced secular matters , and is still used in some religious communities . Sharia law based on Islamic principles is used as the primary legal system in several countries , including Iran and Saudi Arabia . Law 's scope can be divided into two domains .",

Beginning in the 15th century , numerous European powers contested the area for trading rights , with the British ultimately established control of the coast by the late 19th century . Following over a century of native resistance , Ghana 's current borders were established by the 1900s as the British Gold Coast . It became independent of the United Kingdom on 6 March 1957 . Ghana 's population of approximately 30 million spans a variety of ethnic , linguistic and religious groups . According to the 2010 census , 71.2% of the population was Christian , 17.6% was Muslim , and 5.2% practised traditional faiths .

It was founded on 10 January 1920 following the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War ; in 1919 US President Woodrow Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role as the leading architect of the League . The organisation 's primary goals , as stated in its Covenant , included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration . Other issues in this and related treaties included labour conditions , just treatment of native inhabitants , human and drug trafficking , the arms trade , global health , prisoners of war , and protection of minorities in Europe . The Covenant of the League of Nations was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles , and it became effective together with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920 . The first meeting of the Council of the League took place on 16 January 1920 , and the first meeting of Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920 . The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years . The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious First World War Allies ( France , the United Kingdom , Italy and Japan were the permanent members of the Executive Council ) to enforce its resolutions , keep to its economic sanctions , or provide an army when needed . The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so . Sanctions could hurt League members , so they were reluctant to comply with them . During the Second Italo-Abyssinian War , when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting Red Cross medical tents , Benito Mussolini responded that the League is very well when sparrows shout , but no good at all when eagles fall out . At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935 , it had 58 members .",

  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",
