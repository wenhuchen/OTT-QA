[ rarely used ] almae matres ) is an allegorical Latin phrase for a university , school , or college that one formerly attended . In US usage , it can also mean the school from which one graduated . The phrase is variously translated as nourishing mother , nursing mother , or fostering mother , suggesting that a school provides intellectual nourishment to its students .
