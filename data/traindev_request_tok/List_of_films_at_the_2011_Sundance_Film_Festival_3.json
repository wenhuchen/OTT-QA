  "/wiki/Japanese_language": "Japanese ( \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e , Nihongo [ \u0272iho\u014b\u0261o ] ( listen ) ) is an East Asian language spoken by about 128 million people , primarily in Japan , where it is the national language . It is a member of the Japonic ( or Japanese-Ryukyuan ) language family , and its relation to other languages , such as Korean , is debated . Japanese has been grouped with language families such as Ainu , Austroasiatic , and the now-discredited Altaic , but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance . Little is known of the language 's prehistory , or when it first appeared in Japan . Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words , but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century . During the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) , Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese . Late Middle Japanese ( 1185-1600 ) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language , and the first appearance of European loanwords . The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo ( modern Tokyo ) region in the Early Modern Japanese period ( early 17th century-mid-19th century ) . Following the end of Japan 's self-imposed isolation in 1853 , the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly . English loanwords , in particular , have become frequent , and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated . Japanese is an agglutinative , mora-timed language with simple phonotactics , a pure vowel system , phonemic vowel and consonant length , and a lexically significant pitch-accent . Word order is normally subject-object-verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words , and sentence structure is topic-comment .",

  "/wiki/Spanish_language": "Spanish ( /\u02c8sp\u00e6n\u026a\u0283/ ( listen ) ; espa\u00f1ol ( help\u00b7info ) ) , or Castilian ( /k\u00e6\u02c8st\u026ali\u0259n/ ( listen ) , castellano ( help\u00b7info ) ) , is a Romance language that originated in the Iberian Peninsula and today has over 483 million native speakers , mainly in Spain and the Americas . It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere . In 2015 , approximately 40% of the francophone population ( including L2 and partial speakers ) lived in Europe , 35% in sub-Saharan Africa , 15% in North Africa and the Middle East , 8% in the Americas , and 1% in Asia and Oceania . French is the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union . Of Europeans who speak other languages natively , approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language .",

  "/wiki/Norwegian_language": "Norwegian ( norsk ) is a North Germanic language spoken mainly in Norway , where it is the official language . Along with Swedish and Danish , Norwegian forms a dialect continuum of more or less mutually intelligible local and regional varieties ; some Norwegian and Swedish dialects , in particular , are very close . These Scandinavian languages , together with Faroese and Icelandic as well as some extinct languages , constitute the North Germanic languages . Faroese and Icelandic are not mutually intelligible with Norwegian in their spoken form because continental Scandinavian has diverged from them . While the two Germanic languages with the greatest numbers of speakers , English and German , have close similarities with Norwegian , neither is mutually intelligible with it . Norwegian is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . Today there are two official forms of written Norwegian , Bokm\u00e5l ( literally book tongue ) and Nynorsk ( new Norwegian ) , each with its own variants . Bokm\u00e5l developed from the Dano-Norwegian koin\u00e9 language that evolved under the union of Denmark-Norway in the 16th and 17th centuries , while Nynorsk was developed based upon a collective of spoken Norwegian dialects . Norwegian is one of the two official languages in Norway . The other is Sami , spoken by some members of the Sami people , mostly in the Northern part of Norway . Norwegian and Sami are not mutually intelligible , as Sami belongs to the Finno-Ugric group of languages . Sami is spoken by less than one percent of people in Norway .",

In 2013 , Modern Hebrew was spoken by over nine million people worldwide . Historically , it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors , although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh itself . [ note 1 ] The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE . Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family . Hebrew is the only Canaanite language still spoken , and the only truly successful example of a revived dead language . Hebrew had ceased to be an everyday spoken language somewhere between 200 and 400 CE , declining since the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt . [ note 2 ] Aramaic and , to a lesser extent , Greek were already in use as international languages , especially among elites and immigrants . Hebrew survived into the medieval period as the language of Jewish liturgy , rabbinic literature , intra-Jewish commerce and poetry . With the rise of Zionism in the 19th century , it was revived as a spoken and literary language , becoming the main language of the Yishuv , and subsequently of the State of Israel . According to Ethnologue , in 1998 , Hebrew was the language of five million people worldwide .
