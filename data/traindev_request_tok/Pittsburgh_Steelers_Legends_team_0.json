  "/wiki/Pro_Bowl": "The Pro Bowl is the all-star game of the National Football League ( NFL ) . From the merger with the rival American Football League ( AFL ) in 1970 up through 2013 and since 2017 , it is officially called the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl , matching the top players in the American Football Conference ( AFC ) against those in the National Football Conference ( NFC ) . From 2014 through 2016 , the NFL experimented with an unconferenced format , where the teams were selected by two honorary team captains ( who are each in the Hall of Fame ) , instead of selecting players from each conference . The players were picked in a televised schoolyard pick prior to the game . Unlike most major sports leagues , which hold their all-star games roughly midway through their regular seasons , the Pro Bowl is played around the end of the NFL season . The first official Pro Bowl was played in January 1951 , three weeks after the 1950 NFL Championship Game ( between 1939 and 1942 , the NFL experimented with all-star games pitting the league 's champion against a team of all-stars ) . Between 1970 and 2009 , the Pro Bowl was usually held the weekend after the Super Bowl . Since 2010 , it has been played the weekend before the Super Bowl . Players from the two teams competing in the Super Bowl do not participate . For years , the game has suffered from lack of interest due to perceived low quality , with observers and commentators expressing their disfavor with it in its current state . It draws lower TV ratings than regular season NFL games , although the game draws similar ratings to other major all-star games , such as the Major League Baseball All-Star Game . However , the biggest concern of teams is to avoid injuries to the star players .",

  "/wiki/John_Henry_Johnson": "John Henry Johnson ( November 24 , 1929 - June 3 , 2011 ) was a gridiron football running back known for his excellence at the fullback position as both a runner and a blocker . His first professional stint was in Canada in the Western Interprovincial Football Union ( WIFU , a forerunner league to today 's Canadian Football League ) for one season with the Calgary Stampeders . He then played in the National Football League ( NFL ) for the San Francisco 49ers , Detroit Lions , and Pittsburgh Steelers before spending his final season in the American Football League ( AFL ) with the Houston Oilers . Commonly referred to as simply John Henry , an allusion to the folk hero of the same name , Johnson was a tough and tenacious player who performed at a high level well into the tail end of his career . After playing college football for St. Mary 's College of California and Arizona State , Johnson was selected in the second round of the 1953 NFL Draft by the Steelers , the 18th overall pick . He instead played one season of Canadian football for the Stampeders , in which he won the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy as the league 's most valuable player . He then signed with the 49ers , and played left halfback in San Francisco 's famed Million Dollar Backfield . He was traded to Detroit in 1957 , and became the team 's leading rusher en route to that year 's NFL championship , their most recent . His abilities seemingly in decline , Johnson was traded to Pittsburgh in 1960 , where he had the most productive years of his career , recording two 1,000-yard rushing seasons . He remains the oldest player to record a 1,000-yard rushing season as well as the oldest to rush for 200 or more yards in a game , each at age 34 .

It would mark a turning point of the Steelers franchise . 1969 was the first season for Hall of Fame head coach Chuck Noll , the first season for defensive lineman Mean Joe Greene and L. C. Greenwood , the first season for longtime Steelers public relations director Joe Gordon , and the team 's last season in Pitt Stadium before moving into then-state-of-the-art Three Rivers Stadium the following season . Although considered a turning point in the team 's history , the results were not immediate ; after winning the season opener against the Detroit Lions , the Steelers lost every game afterwards to finish 1-13 . The Steelers became the first team in NFL history since the 1936 Philadelphia Eagles to win its season opener and lose every remaining game , a feat not matched until 2001 when the Carolina Panthers won its season opener against Minnesota before losing every game en route to a 1-15 finish . The Steelers finished 1969 4th in the NFL Century Division and tied with the Chicago Bears for last in the NFL . With the Steelers finishing 1-6 at Pitt Stadium , it marked the last time the Steelers finished the season with a losing record at home until 1999 . As a result of their 1-13 records , Art Rooney of the Steelers won a coin toss with George Halas of the Bears to determine who would select Louisiana Tech quarterback Terry Bradshaw ( the consensus number 1 selection among league teams ) with the number one pick in the 1970 draft .
