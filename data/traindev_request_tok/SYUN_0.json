  "/wiki/Compact_Disc": "Compact disc ( CD ) is a digital optical disc data storage format that was co-developed by Philips and Sony and released in 1982 . The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ( CD-DA ) but was later adapted for storage of data ( CD-ROM ) . Several other formats were further derived from these , including write-once audio and data storage ( CD-R ) , rewritable media ( CD-RW ) , Video Compact Disc ( VCD ) , Super Video Compact Disc ( SVCD ) , Photo CD , PictureCD , Compact Disc-Interactive ( CD-i ) , and Enhanced Music CD . The first commercially available audio CD player , the Sony CDP-101 , was released October 1982 in Japan . Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres ( 4.7 in ) and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700 MiB of data . The Mini CD has various diameters ranging from 60 to 80 millimetres ( 2.4 to 3.1 in ) ; they are sometimes used for CD singles , storing up to 24 minutes of audio , or delivering device drivers . At the time of the technology 's introduction in 1982 , a CD could store much more data than a personal computer hard drive , which would typically hold 10 MB . By 2010 , hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs , while their prices had plummeted to commodity level . In 2004 , worldwide sales of audio CDs , CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs . By 2007 , 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide . From the early 2000s , CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution , with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50 percent from their peak ; however , they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry . In 2014 , revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time .",
  "/wiki/P-Model": "P-Model ( also typeset as P-MODEL and P. Model ) was a Japanese electronic rock band started in 1979 by frontman Susumu Hirasawa . The band has experienced many lineup revisions over the years but Hirasawa was always at the helm of operations . P-Model officially disbanded in 2000 , although many of its members continue to release solo albums and collaborate with each other on different projects . Hirasawa has since released work under the name Kaku P-Model , effectively a solo revival of the band .",
  "/wiki/Pause_(P-Model_album)": "Pause is the first live album by P-Model . It was recorded at the final show by the defrosted lineup . It is part of a pair of conceptual takes on a live album , alongside The Way of Live : On this album , Hirasawa presented the show as an audience member would have heard it , and as such most technical glitches and leaked backstage audio heard at the concert was kept for the release .",
  "/wiki/Demo_(P-MODEL)": "P-Model made a demo in 1979 to obtain a recording contract ; it features 2 songs , each one being composed by Susumu Hirasawa and Yasumi Tanaka , P-Model 's main songwriters at the time . The band negotiated with 8 record labels , in the end , they chose to sign a contract with Warner-Pioneer , all P-MODEL releases from 1979 to 1981 ( 3 albums and 3 singles ) were handled by Warner-Pioneer , including IN A MODEL ROOM , the album where both of these songs were included . Hirasawa also gave a copy to Plastics keyboardist Masahide Sakuma after a Plastics show after asking him to produce In a Model Room , which Sakuma accepted . Due to the demo nature of the recordings , they are rawer and punkier than the studio recorded versions . The demo was released by Hirasawa 's SYUN label in 1994 as a bonus for those who bought both OOPARTS and Pause , the first release of the SYUN label ( due to its nature , the demo received a catalogue number outside of the standard numbering convention of the SYUN label ) . The demo was remastered by Hirasawa and re-released on the Ashu-on [ Sound Subspecies ] in the solar system box set on 10 May 2002 ; it was put on CD 13 , with SCUBA RECYCLE , Air On The Wiring and the In a Model Room outtake WHITE SHOES .",
  "/wiki/Mini_CD_single": "A CD single ( sometimes abbreviated to CDS ) is a music single in the form of a compact disc .

The format was introduced in the mid-1980s but did not gain its place in the market until the early 1990s . With the rise in digital downloads in the early 2010s , sales of CD singles have decreased . Commercially released CD singles can vary in length from two songs ( an A side and B side , in the tradition of 7 45rpm records ) up to six songs like an EP . Some contain multiple mixes of one or more songs ( known as remixes ) , in the tradition of 12 vinyl singles , and in some cases , they may also contain a music video for the single itself as well as a collectible poster .

  "/wiki/VHS": "VHS ( short for Video Home System ) is a standard for consumer-level analog video recording on tape cassettes . Developed by Victor Company of Japan ( JVC ) in the early 1970s , it was released in Japan on September 9 , 1976 , and in the United States on August 23 , 1977 . [ citation needed ] From the 1950s , magnetic tape video recording became a major contributor to the television industry , via the first commercialized video tape recorders ( VTRs ) . At that time , the expensive devices were used only in professional environments such as television studios and medical imaging ( fluoroscopy ) . In the 1970s , videotape entered home use , creating the home video industry and changing the economics of the television and movie businesses . The television industry viewed videocassette recorders ( VCRs ) as having the power to disrupt their business , while television users viewed the VCR as the means to take control of their viewing experience . In the 1970s and early 1980s , there was a format war in the home video industry . Two of the standards , VHS and Betamax , received the most media exposure . VHS eventually won the war , dominating 60 percent of the North American market by 1980 and emerging as the dominant home video format throughout the tape media period . Optical disc formats later began to offer better quality than analog consumer video tape such as VHS and S-VHS . The earliest of these formats , LaserDisc , was not widely adopted across Europe , but was hugely popular in Japan and a minor hit in the United States . After the introduction of the DVD format in 1996 , however , the market share for VHS began to decline .",
  "/wiki/Gramophone_record": "A phonograph record ( also known as a gramophone record , especially in British English ) , often simply record , is an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat disc with an inscribed , modulated spiral groove . The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc . At first , the discs were commonly made from shellac ; starting in the 1940s polyvinyl chloride became common . In the mid-2000s , gradually , records made of any material began to be called vinyl records , or simply vinyl . The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction throughout the 20th century . It had co-existed with the phonograph cylinder from the late 1880s and had effectively superseded it by around 1912 . Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as the compact cassette were mass-marketed . By the 1980s , digital media , in the form of the compact disc , had gained a larger market share , and the record left the mainstream in 1991 . Since the 1990s , records continue to be manufactured and sold on a smaller scale , and are especially used by disc jockeys ( DJs ) and released by artists in mostly dance music genres , and listened to by a growing niche market of audiophiles . The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century - 9.2 million records were sold in the US in 2014 , a 260% increase since 2009 . Likewise , sales in the UK increased five-fold from 2009 to 2014 . As of 2017 , 48 record pressing facilities remain worldwide , 18 in the US and 30 in other countries ."
