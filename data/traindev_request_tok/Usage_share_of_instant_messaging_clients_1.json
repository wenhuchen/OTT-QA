Messages sent via BBM were sent over the Internet and used the BlackBerry PIN system . In the past , many service providers allowed sign-in to BBM using a dedicated BlackBerry data plan . Exchanging messages was possible to a single person or via dedicated discussion or chat groups , which allowed multiple BlackBerry devices to communicate in a single session . In addition to offering text-based instant messages , BBM also allowed users to send pictures , voicenotes ( audio recordings ) , files ( up to 16 MB ) , share real time location on a map , stickers and a wide selection of emojis .

Daily , approximately 150,000 BBM Voice Calls were placed . There were more than 190 million BBM users worldwide as of 2015 , and BlackBerry infrastructure handled 30 petabytes of data traffic each month by early 2013 .",

  "/wiki/XMPP": "Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ( XMPP ) is a communication protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML ( Extensible Markup Language ) . It enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet extensible data between any two or more network entities . Originally named Jabber , the protocol was developed by the eponymous open-source community in 1999 for near real-time instant messaging ( IM ) , presence information , and contact list maintenance . Designed to be extensible , the protocol has been used also for publish-subscribe systems , signalling for VoIP , video , file transfer , gaming , the Internet of Things ( IoT ) applications such as the smart grid , and social networking services . Unlike most instant messaging protocols , XMPP is defined in an open standard and uses an open systems approach of development and application , by which anyone may implement an XMPP service and interoperate with other organizations ' implementations . Because XMPP is an open protocol , implementations can be developed using any software license and many server , client , and library implementations are distributed as free and open-source software . Numerous freeware and commercial software implementations also exist . The Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) formed an XMPP working group in 2002 to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and presence technology . The XMPP Working group produced four specifications ( RFC 3920 , RFC 3921 , RFC 3922 , RFC 3923 ) , which were approved as Proposed Standards in 2004 . In 2011 , RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 were superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively , with RFC 6122 specifying the XMPP address format . In 2015 , RFC 6122 was superseded by RFC 7622 . In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF , the XMPP Standards Foundation ( formerly the Jabber Software Foundation ) is active in developing open XMPP extensions .",
