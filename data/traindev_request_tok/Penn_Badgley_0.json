After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles , Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan 's East Village such as Sin-\u00e9 , gradually focusing more on his own material . After rebuffing much interest from record labels and his father 's manager , Herb Cohen , he signed with Columbia , recruited a band , and recorded what would be his only studio album , Grace , in 1994 . Over the following three years , the band toured extensively to promote the album , including concerts in the U.S. , Europe , Japan , and Australia .

In 1997 , Buckley moved to Memphis , Tennessee , to resume work on the album , to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk , recording many four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue .
