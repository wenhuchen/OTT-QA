Historically part of Lanarkshire , the city now forms the Glasgow City council area , one of the 32 council areas of Scotland ; the local authority is Glasgow City Council . Glasgow is situated on the River Clyde in the country 's West Central Lowlands . It is the fifth most visited city in the UK . Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians or , informally , as Weegies . Glasgow is also known for the Glasgow patter , a distinct dialect of the Scots language that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city . Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland , and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain . Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh , and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the fifteenth century , it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the eighteenth century . From the eighteenth century onwards , the city also grew as one of Great Britain 's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies . With the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world 's pre-eminent centres of chemicals , textiles and engineering ; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry , which produced many innovative and famous vessels . Glasgow was the Second City of the British Empire for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period , although many cities argue the title was theirs . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Glasgow 's population grew rapidly , reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938 .",

Bath is in the valley of the River Avon , 97 miles ( 156 km ) west of London and 11 miles ( 18 km ) southeast of Bristol . The city became a World Heritage site in 1987 . The city became a spa with the Latin name Aquae Sulis ( the waters of Sul ) c. 60 AD when the Romans built baths and a temple in the valley of the River Avon , although hot springs were known even before then . Bath Abbey was founded in the 7th century and became a religious centre ; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries . In the 17th century , claims were made for the curative properties of water from the springs , and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era . Georgian architecture , crafted from Bath stone , includes the Royal Crescent , Circus , Pump Room and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city 's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761 . Many of the streets and squares were laid out by John Wood , the Elder , and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew . Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century . Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II .

  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed .",
  "/wiki/Clemency": "A pardon is a government decision to allow a person to be relieved of some or all of the legal consequences resulting from a criminal conviction . A pardon may be granted before or after conviction for the crime , depending on the laws of the jurisdiction . Pardons can be granted in many countries when individuals are deemed to have demonstrated that they have paid their debt to society , or are otherwise considered to be deserving of them . Pardons are sometimes offered to persons who were either wrongfully convicted or who claim that they were wrongfully convicted . In some jurisdictions of some nations , accepting a pardon may implicitly constitute an admission of guilt ; the offer is refused in some cases . Cases of wrongful conviction are in recent times more often dealt with by appeal rather than by pardon ; however , a pardon is sometimes offered when innocence is undisputed in order to avoid the costs that are associated with a retrial . Clemency plays a critical role when capital punishment is applied . Pardons are sometimes seen as a mechanism for combating corruption , allowing a particular authority to circumvent a flawed judicial process to free someone that is seen as wrongly convicted . Pardons can also be a source of controversy . In extreme cases , some pardons may be seen as acts of corruption by officials in the form of granting effective immunity as political favors .",
  "/wiki/Life_imprisonment": "Life imprisonment ( also known as imprisonment for life , life in prison , whole-life order , a life sentence , a life term , lifelong incarceration , life incarceration or simply life ) is any sentence of imprisonment for a crime under which convicted persons are to remain in prison either for the rest of their natural life or until paroled or otherwise commuted to a fixed term . Crimes for which , in some countries , a person could receive this sentence include murder , attempted murder , conspiracy to commit murder , blasphemy , apostasy , terrorism , severe child abuse , rape , child rape , espionage , treason , high treason , drug dealing , drug trafficking , drug possession , human trafficking , severe cases of fraud , severe cases of financial crimes , aggravated criminal damage in English law , and aggravated cases of arson , kidnapping , burglary , or robbery which result in death or grievous bodily harm , piracy , aircraft hijacking , and in certain cases genocide , ethnic cleansing , crimes against humanity , certain war crimes or any three felonies in case of three strikes law . Life imprisonment ( as a maximum term ) can also be imposed , in certain countries , for traffic offenses causing death . The life sentence does not exist in all countries : Portugal was the first to abolish life imprisonment , in 1884 . Where life imprisonment is a possible sentence , there may also exist formal mechanisms for requesting parole after a certain period of prison time . This means that a convict could be entitled to spend the rest of the sentence ( until that individual dies ) outside prison . Early release is usually conditional on past and future conduct , possibly with certain restrictions or obligations . In contrast , when a fixed term of imprisonment has ended , the convict is free . The length of time served and the conditions surrounding parole vary . Being eligible for parole does not necessarily ensure that parole will be granted . In some countries , including Sweden , parole does not exist but a life sentence may - after a successful application - be commuted to a fixed-term sentence , after which the culprit is released as if the sentence served was that originally imposed . In many countries around the world , particularly in the Commonwealth , courts have the authority to pass prison terms which may amount to de facto life imprisonment .",

Nevill and June Bamber were shot and killed inside their farmhouse , along with their daughter , Sheila Caffell , and Sheila 's six-year-old twin sons , Daniel and Nicholas Caffell . The only surviving member of June and Nevill 's immediate family was their adopted son , Jeremy Bamber , then 24 years old , who said he had been at home a few miles away when the shooting took place . The police at first believed that Sheila , diagnosed with schizophrenia , had fired the shots then turned the gun on herself . But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber 's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself . The prosecution argued that , motivated by a large inheritance , Bamber had shot the family with his father 's semi-automatic rifle , then placed the gun in his unstable sister 's hands to make it look like a murder-suicide . A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long , they argued , for Sheila 's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself . Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10-2 majority , sentenced to a minimum of 25 years , and informed in 1994 that he would never be released . The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002 . Bamber protested his innocence throughout , although his extended family remained convinced of his guilt . Between 2004 and 2012 , his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission . They argued that the silencer might not have been used during the killings , that the crime scene may have been damaged then reconstructed , that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks after the murders , and that the time of Sheila 's death had been miscalculated .",

He was found guilty in October 1986 of the August 1985 shooting of his parents , his sister , and his sister 's six-year-old twin sons at his parents ' farmhouse in Essex . Returning a majority verdict , the jury found that , after committing the murders to secure a large inheritance , Bamber had placed the rifle in the hands of his 28-year-old sister , who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia , to make the scene appear to be a murder-suicide . Bamber is serving life imprisonment without the possibility of parole . As of November 2016 he was one of 70 prisoners in the UK subject to a whole-life order , and is the only such prisoner to assert his innocence . Bamber has repeatedly applied unsuccessfully to have his conviction overturned or his whole life tariff removed ; his extended family remain convinced of his guilt . The Criminal Cases Review Commission ( CCRC ) referred the case to the Court of Appeal in 2001 , which upheld the conviction in 2002 . The Court of Appeal ordered full disclosure of evidence to the defence , but this did not take place . The appeal was rejected and the CCRC rejected further applications from Bamber in 2004 and 2012 , having not identified any new evidence or legal argument capable of raising a real possibility that the court of appeal would quash the conviction .

  "/wiki/East_End_of_London": "The East End of London , often referred to within the London area simply as the East End , is the historic core of wider East London , east of the Roman and medieval walls of the City of London , and north of the River Thames . It does not have universally accepted boundaries to the north and east , though the River Lea is sometimes seen as the eastern boundary . Parts of it may be regarded as lying within Central London ( though that term too has no precise definition ) . The term East of Aldgate Pump is sometimes used as a synonym for the area . The East End began to emerge in the Middle Ages with initially slow urban growth outside the eastern walls , which later accelerated , especially in the 19th century , to absorb pre-existing settlements . The first known written record of the East End as a distinct entity , as opposed its component parts , comes from John Strype 's 1720 Survey of London , which describes London as consisting of four parts : the City of London , Westminster , Southwark , and That Part beyond the Tower . The relevance of Strype 's reference to the Tower was more than geographical . The East End was the urbanised part of an administrative area called the Tower Division , which had owed military service to the Tower of London since time immemorial . Later , as London grew further , the fully urbanised Tower Division became a byword for wider East London , before East London grew further still , east of the River Lea and into Essex . The area was notorious for its deep poverty , overcrowding and associated social problems . This led to the East End 's history of intense political activism and association with some of the country 's most influential social reformers . Another major theme of East End history has been migration , both inward and outward .",

However , there were two degrees of murder between 1957 and 1965 , one carrying the death penalty and one life imprisonment . Life imprisonment is only applicable to defendants aged 21 or over . Those aged between 18 and 20 are sentenced to custody for life . Those aged under 18 are sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure for murder , or detention for life for other crimes where life imprisonment is the sentence for adults ; however , regardless of age all defendants including those under 18 sentenced to a life sentence can theoretically be held in custody for their whole life if required and a life sentence can only end if quashed by a judge or the person serving the sentence dies . In addition to the sentences mentioned above , until 2012 there were two other kinds of life sentence , imprisonment for public protection ( for those over 18 ) and detention for public protection ( for those under 18 ) . These were for defendants whose crimes were not serious enough to merit a normal life sentence , but who were considered a danger to the public and so should not be released until the Parole Board had decided that they no longer represented a risk . These sentences were abolished by the Legal Aid , Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 , although a number of prisoners remain imprisoned under the former legislation .",
  "/wiki/Gamma-Hydroxybutyric_acid": "gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid or \u03b3-Hydroxybutyric acid ( GHB ) , also known as 4-hydroxybutanoic acid , is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter and a psychoactive drug . It is a precursor to GABA , glutamate , and glycine in certain brain areas . It acts on the GHB receptor and is a weak agonist at the GABAB receptor . GHB has been used in a medical setting as a general anesthetic and as a treatment for cataplexy , narcolepsy , and alcoholism . It is also used illegally as an intoxicant , as an athletic performance enhancer , as a date rape drug , and as a recreational drug . It is commonly used in the form of a salt , such as sodium \u03b3-hydroxybutyrate ( Na.GHB , sodium oxybate , or Xyrem ) or potassium \u03b3-hydroxybutyrate ( K.GHB , potassium oxybate ) . GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation , and is found in small quantities in some beers and wines , beef and small citrus fruits . Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disease that causes GHB to accumulate in the blood ."
