It was built between 1823 and 1827 for King Karl XIV Johan , the first Bernadotte King of Sweden . It was intended as an escape from the formalities of court life at the Royal Palace . Rosendal Palace was largely designed by Fredrik Blom , one of the leading architects of the time , who received a royal commission to draw and build the palace building after the original buildings burned down . Fredrik August Lidstr\u00f6mer , Stockholm 's City Architect from 1818 to 1824 , had been King Karl XIV Johan 's primary architect at the construction of the original Rosendal Palace . After it burned down in 1819 , Lidstr\u00f6mer also created the initial drawings for the replacement palace . These were then adapted and redrawn by Fredrik Blom , who had been an assistant to Jonas Lidstr\u00f6mer , father of Fredrik August Lidstr\u00f6mer . The Queen 's Pavilion at Rosendal Palace ( Swedish : Drottningpaviljongen ) ) and Guard 's Cottage ( Swedish : Vaktstugan ) remained entirely the work of Fredrik August Lidstr\u00f6mer . The creation of the Rosendal Palace in the 1820s marked the beginning of the development of Djurg\u00e5rden into a stately residential area . When King Oskar II died in 1907 , his heirs decided to make Rosendal Palace a museum of the Karl Johan period and of the life of Karl XIV Johan . This makes Rosendal Palace a unique [ citation needed ] documentation of the European Empire style , in Sweden also known as the Karl Johan style . The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared in other parts of Europe .",
