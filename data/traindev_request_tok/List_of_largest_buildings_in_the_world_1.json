Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east .

The first cars manufactured by AvtoVAZ , with technical assistance from Fiat , were marketed under the Zhiguli brand , allegedly chosen after it was suggested by the designer , A. M. Cherny . When the cars began to be exported on foreign markets , the Zhiguli brand was found to be inappropriate , as it was hard to pronounce for non-Russian speakers , and it was said to resemble the word gigolo too closely . The Lada brand appeared in 1973 , and it has since become the main brand for AvtoVAZ vehicles . The name Lada is derived from a type of small boat in Slavic language ( lad'ya [ ru ] ) , symbolized by the car 's logo . The brand has a long history in Russia , and it is well known in post-Soviet countries ; today Lada vehicles are positioned as affordable , and as offering good value for money . The keys to its success were said to be its competitive price , reliability , simple DIY-friendly mechanics and simple functionality . The car was built under license in several other countries . The competitive pricing and ease of service made Ladas popular as police cars , taxis and a range of public service and civil defense vehicles in many parts of Europe , Africa , and the Caribbean .",

Historically in County Durham , there were three original settlements by the mouth of the River Wear on the site of modern-day Sunderland . On the north side of the river , Monkwearmouth was settled in 674 when King Ecgfrith of Northumbria granted land to Benedict Biscop to found Monkwearmouth Monastery . In 685 , Ecgfrith further granted Biscop the land adjacent to the monastery on the south side of the river . As the river separated this land from the monastic community , it was henceforth referred to as the sunder-land , and would grow as a fishing settlement before being granted a charter in 1179 . West of the medieval village of Sunderland on the south bank , Bishopwearmouth was founded in 930 . Sunderland grew as a port , trading coal and salt . Ships began to be built on the river in the 14th century . By the 19th century , the port of Sunderland had absorbed Bishopwearmouth and Monkwearmouth , owing to the growing economic importance of the shipbuilding docks . Following the decline of the city 's traditional industries in the late 20th century , the area grew into a commercial centre for the automotive industry , science and technology and the service sector . Bede , sometimes called the father of English history , began his monastic career at Monkwearmouth monastery in Sunderland , before moving to the newly founded Jarrow monastery in 685 ( these monasteries together formed the dual Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey ) . It therefore seems likely that he was born in or near Sunderland .",

Everett was platted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby . The city was incorporated in 1893 , shortly after the arrival of the Great Northern Railway , and prospered as a major industrial center . Everett 's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after World War II , with the construction of Boeing 's aircraft assembly plant at Paine Field in 1967 . Boeing remains the city 's largest employer , alongside the U.S. Navy , which has operated Naval Station Everett since 1992 . Everett received an All-America City Award in 2002 .

Named for George Washington , the first U.S. president , the state was made out of the western part of the Washington Territory , which was ceded by the British Empire in 1846 , in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute . The state , which is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean , Oregon to the south , Idaho to the east , and the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north , was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889 .

  "/wiki/Aircraft": "An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air . It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil , or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines . Common examples of aircraft include airplanes , helicopters , airships ( including blimps ) , gliders , paramotors and hot air balloons . The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation . The science of aviation , including designing and building aircraft , is called aeronautics . Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot , but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers . Aircraft may be classified by different criteria , such as lift type , aircraft propulsion , usage and others .",
  "/wiki/Boeing_747": "The Boeing 747 is an American wide-body , long-range , commercial jet airliner and cargo aircraft . The first wide-body airplane produced , it was the first plane dubbed a Jumbo Jet . Its distinctive hump upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft has made it one of the most recognizable aircraft . Manufactured by Boeing 's Commercial Airplane unit in the United States , the 747 was originally planned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the Boeing 707 , a common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s . First flown commercially in 1970 , the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years . The 747 uses a double-deck configuration for part of its length and is available in passenger , freighter , and other versions . Boeing designed the 747 's hump-like upper deck to serve as a first-class lounge or extra seating , and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door . Boeing expected supersonic airliners - the development of which was announced in the early 1960s - to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete , while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would remain robust well into the future . Though the 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold , production passed 1,000 in 1993 . By June 2019 , 1,554 aircraft had been built , with 20 of the 747-8 variants remaining on order . As of January 2017 [ update ] , 60 of the jets have been lost in accidents in which a total of 3,722 people died . The 747-400 , the most common variant in service , has a high-subsonic cruise speed of Mach 0.85-0.855 ( up to 570 mph or 920 km/h ) with an intercontinental range of 7,260 nautical miles ( 8,350 statute miles or 13,450 km ) .",

It is the world 's second-largest religion with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1% of the world 's population , commonly known as Muslims . Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries . Islam teaches that God is merciful , all-powerful , and unique , and has guided mankind through prophets , revealed scriptures and natural signs . The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran , believed to be the verbatim word of God , and the teachings and normative examples ( called the sunnah , composed of accounts called hadith ) of Muhammad ( c. 570 - 8 June 632 CE ) . Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam , Abraham , Moses and Jesus . Muslims consider the Quran in its Arabic to be the unaltered and final revelation of God . Like other Abrahamic religions , Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and unrighteous punished in hell . Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam , which are obligatory acts of worship , and following Islamic law ( sharia ) , which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society , from banking and welfare to women and the environment . The cities of Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam . Aside from the theological narrative , Islam is historically believed to have originated in the early 7th century CE in Mecca , and by the 8th century the Umayyad Caliphate extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east . The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century , during the Abbasid Caliphate , when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific , economic and cultural flourishing .",
