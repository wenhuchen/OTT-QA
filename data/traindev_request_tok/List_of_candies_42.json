  "/wiki/Confectionery": "Confectionery is the art of making confections , which are food items that are rich in sugar and carbohydrates . Exact definitions are difficult . In general , though , confectionery is divided into two broad and somewhat overlapping categories , bakers ' confections and sugar confections .

Sugar confectionery includes candies ( usually called sweets in British English ) , candied nuts , chocolates , chewing gum , bubble gum , pastillage , and other confections that are made primarily of sugar . In some cases , chocolate confections ( confections made of chocolate ) are treated as a separate category , as are sugar-free versions of sugar confections . The words candy ( US and Canada ) , sweets ( UK and Ireland ) , and lollies ( Australia and New Zealand ) are common words for the most common varieties of sugar confectionery . The confectionery industry also includes specialized training schools and extensive historical records . Traditional confectionery goes back to ancient times and continued to be eaten through the Middle Ages into the modern era .",

  "/wiki/Peanut": "The peanut , also known as the groundnut , goober ( US ) , or monkey nut ( UK ) , and taxonomically classified as Arachis hypogaea , is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds . It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics , being important to both small and large commercial producers . It is classified as both a grain legume and , due to its high oil content , an oil crop . World annual production of shelled peanuts was 44 million tonnes in 2016 , led by China with 38% of the world total . Atypically among legume crop plants , peanut pods develop underground ( geocarpy ) rather than above ground . With this characteristic in mind , the botanist Carl Linnaeus named the species hypogaea , which means under the earth . As a legume , the peanut belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae ; this is also known as Leguminosae , and commonly known as the bean , or pea , family . Like most other legumes , peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules . This capacity to fix nitrogen means peanuts require less nitrogen-containing fertilizer and also improve soil fertility , making them valuable in crop rotations . Peanuts are similar in taste and nutritional profile to tree nuts such as walnuts and almonds , and as a culinary nut are often served in similar ways in Western cuisines . The botanical definition of a nut is a fruit whose ovary wall becomes hard at maturity . Using this criterion , the peanut is not a typical nut .",
