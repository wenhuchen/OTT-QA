Terms such as masked crime fighters , costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit , who may not be explicitly referred to as superheroes but nevertheless share similar traits . Some superheroes use their powers to help daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains , who are their criminal counterparts .
