Jackman and Weisz play sets of characters bonded by love across time and space : a conquistador and his ill-fated queen , a modern-day scientist and his cancer-stricken wife , and a traveler immersed in a universal journey alongside aspects of his lost love . The storylines - interwoven with use of match cuts and recurring visual motifs - reflect the themes and interplay of love and mortality . Aronofsky originally planned to direct The Fountain on a $ 70 million budget with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the lead roles , but Pitt 's withdrawal and cost overruns led Warner Bros. to shut down his production . The director rewrote the script to be sparser , and was able to resurrect the film with a $ 35 million budget with Jackman and Weisz in the lead roles . Production mainly took place on a sound stage in Montreal , Quebec , and the director used macro photography to create key visual effects for The Fountain at a low cost . The film was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on November 22 , 2006 .

  "/wiki/Tangled": "Tangled is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated musical adventure film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures . Loosely based on the German fairy tale Rapunzel in the collection of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm , it is the 50th Disney animated feature film . Featuring the voices of Mandy Moore , Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy , the film tells the story of a lost , young princess with magical long blonde hair who yearns to leave her secluded tower . Against her mother 's wishes , she accepts the aid of an intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen . Before the film 's release , its title was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled , reportedly to market the film gender-neutrally . Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $ 260 million , which , if accurate , would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and one of the most expensive films of all time . The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to create the impression of a painting . Composer Alan Menken , who had worked on prior Disney animated features , returned to score Tangled . Tangled premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on November 14 , 2010 , and went into general release on November 24 . The film earned $ 591 million in worldwide box office revenue , $ 200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada . The film was nominated for a number of awards , including Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards . The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 29 , 2011 ; a short film , Tangled Ever After , was released later in 2012 and a television series premiered in 2017 .",
  "/wiki/Mother_Gothel": "Mother Gothel is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures ' 50th animated feature film Tangled ( 2010 ) . The character is voiced by actress and singer Donna Murphy in her voice acting debut ; Murphy auditioned for the role spontaneously upon learning from her agent that Disney was auditioning actresses for the film 's villainous role . Loosely based on Dame Gothel in the German fairy tale Rapunzel , Mother Gothel is a vain old woman who hoards the supremely strong healing powers of a magical gold flower in order to live for many , many years and remain perpetually young and beautiful . When the flower is harvested in order to heal the kingdom 's ailing queen , its powers are inherited by the king and the queen 's daughter Rapunzel , removing Gothel 's access . With her life suddenly endangered , Gothel kidnaps the infant , imprisoning the princess in an isolated tower for eighteen years while posing as her mother in order to exploit her powers . Inspired by Disney villainesses such as the Evil Queen and Lady Tremaine from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) and Cinderella ( 1950 ) , respectively , Gothel was developed by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard into a more original , complex villain than the witch upon whom she is based because the character is forced to rely solely on her wit , charisma and intelligence as opposed to sorcery in order to survive . The film 's most difficult character to develop , Gothel 's exotic appearance , whose beauty , dark curly hair and voluptuous figure were deliberately designed to serve as a foil to Rapunzel 's , was inspired by the appearance of Murphy herself and American singer Cher . Mother Gothel has been mostly well received by film critics , who enjoyed the character 's humor , complexity , charisma and showmanship , dubbing her a scene stealer , while praising Murphy 's performance enthusiastically . However , some critics argued that Gothel was too passive , dismissing her as a weaker , less intimidating Disney villainess than Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty ( 1959 ) and Cruella de Vil from One Hundred and One Dalmatians ( 1961 ) .",
