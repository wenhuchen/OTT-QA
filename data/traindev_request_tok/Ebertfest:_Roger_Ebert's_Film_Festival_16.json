A novelisation of the film released after the film 's premiere was in part written concurrently with the screenplay . The film , which follows a voyage to Jupiter with the sentient computer HAL after the discovery of a featureless alien monolith affecting human evolution , deals with themes of existentialism , human evolution , technology , artificial intelligence , and the possibility of extraterrestrial life . The film is noted for its scientifically accurate depiction of space flight , pioneering special effects , and ambiguous imagery . Sound and dialogue are used sparingly and often in place of traditional cinematic and narrative techniques . The soundtrack incorporates a number of pieces of classical music , among them Also sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss , The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss II , and works by Aram Khachaturian and Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti . The film received diverse critical responses ranging from those who saw it as darkly apocalyptic in tone to those who saw it as an optimistic reappraisal of the hopes of humanity . The film garnered a cult following and became the highest-grossing North American film of 1968 . It was nominated for four Academy Awards ; Kubrick won for his direction of the visual effects . 2001 : A Space Odyssey is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made . In 1991 , it was deemed culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry .",
  "/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick": "Stanley Kubrick ( /\u02c8ku\u02d0br\u026ak/ ; July 26 , 1928 - March 7 , 1999 ) was an American film director , screenwriter , and producer . He is frequently cited as one of the most influential filmmakers in cinematic history . His films , which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories , cover a wide range of genres , and are noted for their realism , dark humor , unique cinematography , extensive set designs , and evocative use of music . Kubrick was raised in the Bronx , New York City , and attended William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945 . He received average grades , but displayed a keen interest in literature , photography , and film from a young age , and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school . After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s , he began making short films on a shoestring budget , and made his first major Hollywood film , The Killing , for United Artists in 1956 . This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas , the war picture Paths of Glory ( 1957 ) and the historical epic Spartacus ( 1960 ) . His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew , and he was approached by Marlon Brando to film what would become One-Eyed Jacks ( 1961 ) , though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself . Creative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios , a dislike of the Hollywood industry , and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961 , where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career . His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire , which he shared with his wife Christiane , became his workplace , where he did his writing , research , editing , and management of production details . This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films , but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios . His first productions in Britain were two films with Peter Sellers , Lolita ( 1962 ) and Dr. Strangelove ( 1964 ) .",

A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era , Altman was considered a maverick in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic , unlike most Hollywood films . He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema . His style of filmmaking covered many genres , but usually with a subversive twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views . Altman developed a reputation for being anti-Hollywood and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style . However , actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise , thereby inspiring their own creativity . He preferred large ensemble casts for his films , and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors . This produced a more natural , more dynamic , and more complex experience for the viewer . He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen . Critic Pauline Kael , writing about his directing style , said that Altman could make film fireworks out of next to nothing .
