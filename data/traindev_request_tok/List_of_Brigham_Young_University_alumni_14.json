  "/wiki/Dismissal_of_U.S._attorneys_controversy": "On December 7 , 2006 , the George W. Bush administration 's Department of Justice ordered the unprecedented midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys . Congressional investigations focused on whether the Department of Justice and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage . Allegations were that some of the attorneys were targeted for dismissal to impede investigations of Republican politicians or that some were targeted for their failure to initiate investigations that would damage Democratic politicians or hamper Democratic-leaning voters . The U.S. attorneys were replaced with interim appointees , under provisions in the 2005 USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization . A subsequent report by the Justice Department Inspector General in October 2008 found that the process used to fire the first seven attorneys and two others dismissed around the same time was arbitrary , fundamentally flawed , and raised doubts about the integrity of Department prosecution decisions . In July 2010 , the Department of Justice prosecutors closed the two-year investigation without filing charges after determining that the firing was inappropriately political , but not criminal , saying Evidence did not demonstrate that any prosecutable criminal offense was committed with regard to the removal of David Iglesias . The investigative team also determined that the evidence did not warrant expanding the scope of the investigation beyond the removal of Iglesias .",

  "/wiki/Capital_punishment": "Capital punishment , also known as the death penalty , is a government-sanctioned practice whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime . The sentence ordering that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a death sentence , whereas the act of carrying out such a sentence is known as an execution . A prisoner who has been sentenced to death and is awaiting execution is referred to as condemned , and is said to be on death row . Crimes that are punishable by death are known as capital crimes , capital offences or capital felonies , and vary depending on the jurisdiction , but commonly include serious offences such as murder , mass murder , aggravated cases of rape , child rape , child sexual abuse , terrorism , treason , espionage , sedition , piracy , aircraft hijacking , drug trafficking and drug dealing , war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide , and in some cases , the most serious acts of recidivism , aggravated robbery , and kidnapping . Etymologically , the term capital ( lit . of the head , derived via the Latin capitalis from caput , head ) in this context alluded to execution by beheading . Fifty-six countries retain capital punishment , 106 countries have completely abolished it de jure for all crimes , eight have abolished it for ordinary crimes ( while maintaining it for special circumstances such as war crimes ) , and 28 are abolitionist in practice . Capital punishment is a matter of active controversy in several countries and states , and positions can vary within a single political ideology or cultural region . In the European Union , Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibits the use of capital punishment . The Council of Europe , which has 47 member states , has sought to abolish the use of the death penalty by its members absolutely , through Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights . However , this only affects those member states which have signed and ratified it , and they do not include Armenia , Russia , and Azerbaijan . The United Nations General Assembly has adopted , in 2007 , 2008 , 2010 , 2012 and 2014 , non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions , with a view to eventual abolition .",
