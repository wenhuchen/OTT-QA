  "/wiki/Film_tinting": "The process began in the 1890s , originally as a copy-guard against film pirates . The film was tinted amber , the color of the safelight on film printers . The discovery of bleaching methods by pirates soon put an end to this . Both the Edison Studios and the Biograph Company began tinting their films for setting moods . Because orthochromatic film stock could not be used in low-light situations , blue became the most popular tint , applied to scenes shot during the day and when projected , signified night . A variation of film tinting is hand coloring , in which only parts of the image are colored by hand with dyes , sometimes using a stencil cut from a second print of the film to keep colouring the same piece on different frames . The first hand tinted movie was Annabelle Serpentine Dance ( 1895 ) , from Edison Studios . In it , Annabelle Moore , a young dancer from Broadway , is dressed in white veils that appear to change colors as she dances . Hand coloring was often used in early trick and fantasy films from Europe , especially those by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s . M\u00e9li\u00e8s experimented with color in his film biography of Joan of Arc ( 1900 ) , leading to a more spectacular [ peacock term ] use of color in his 1903 Trip to the Moon , made available to modern viewers only after the 2012 release of a restoration of the film by Lobster Films .
