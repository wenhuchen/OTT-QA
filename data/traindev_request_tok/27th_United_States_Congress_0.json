  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party . The Democratic Party 's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality , along with the welfare state . It seeks to provide government regulation in the economy .",

  "/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)": "The Whig Party was a political party active in the middle of the 19th century in the United States of America . Alongside the Democratic Party , it was one of the two major parties in the United States during the late 1830s , the 1840s , and the early 1850s , part of the Second Party System . Four U.S. presidents were affiliated with the Whig party for at least part of their respective terms . Other influential party leaders include Henry Clay , Daniel Webster , William Seward , John J. Crittenden , and Truman Smith . The Whigs emerged in the 1830s in opposition to President Andrew Jackson , pulling together former members of the National Republican Party , the Anti-Masonic Party , and disaffected Democrats . The Whigs had some links to the defunct Federalist Party , but the Whig Party was not a direct successor to that party and many Whig leaders , including Clay , had aligned with the rival Democratic-Republican Party . In the 1836 presidential election , four different Whig candidates received electoral votes , but the party failed to defeat Jackson 's chosen successor , Martin Van Buren . Whig nominee William Henry Harrison unseated Van Buren in the 1840 presidential election , but died just one month into his term . Harrison 's successor , John Tyler , was expelled from the party in 1841 after clashing with Clay and other Whig Party leaders over economic policies such as the re-establishment of a national bank . Clay won his party 's nomination in the 1844 presidential election but was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk , who subsequently presided over the Mexican-American War . Whig nominee Zachary Taylor won the 1848 presidential election , but Taylor died in 1850 and was succeeded by Millard Fillmore . Fillmore , Clay , Daniel Webster , and Democrat Stephen A. Douglas led the passage of the Compromise of 1850 , which helped to defuse sectional tensions in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War .",

He alienated anti-slavery groups by championing and signing the Kansas-Nebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act , yet he failed to stem conflict between North and South , setting the stage for Southern secession and the American Civil War . Pierce was born in New Hampshire , and served in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate until he resigned from the Senate in 1842 . His private law practice was a success , and he was appointed New Hampshire 's U.S. Attorney in 1845 . He took part in the Mexican-American War as a brigadier general in the Army . He was seen by Democrats as a compromise candidate uniting northern and southern interests and was nominated as the party 's candidate for president on the 49th ballot at the 1852 Democratic National Convention . He and running mate William R. King easily defeated the Whig Party ticket of Winfield Scott and William A. Graham in the 1852 presidential election . As president , Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also satisfying the diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage , an effort which largely failed and turned many in his party against him . He was a Young America expansionist who signed the Gadsden Purchase of land from Mexico and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain . He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan , while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability , but these successes were overshadowed by political strife during his presidency .

For his role in defusing sectional crises , he earned the appellation of the Great Compromiser . Clay was born in Hanover County , Virginia in 1777 and launched a legal career in Lexington , Kentucky , in 1797 . As a member of the Democratic-Republican Party , Clay won election to the Kentucky state legislature in 1803 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810 . He was chosen as speaker of the House in early 1811 and , along with President James Madison , led the United States into the War of 1812 against Britain . In 1814 , he helped negotiate the Treaty of Ghent , which brought an end to the War of 1812 . After the war , Clay returned to his position as speaker of the House and developed the American System , which called for federal infrastructure investments , support for the national bank , and protective tariff rates . In 1820 , he helped bring an end to a sectional crisis over slavery by leading the passage of the Missouri Compromise .

  "/wiki/John_J._Crittenden": "John Jordan Crittenden ( September 10 , 1787 - July 26 , 1863 ) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Kentucky . He represented the state in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate and twice served as United States Attorney General in the administrations of William Henry Harrison , John Tyler , and Millard Fillmore . He was also the 17th governor of Kentucky and served in the state legislature . Although frequently mentioned as a potential candidate for the U.S. presidency , he never consented to run for the office . During his early political career , Crittenden served in the Kentucky House of Representatives and was chosen as speaker on several occasions . With the advent of the Second Party System , he allied with the National Republican ( later Whig ) Party and was a fervent supporter of Henry Clay and opponent of Democrats Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren . Lame duck president John Quincy Adams nominated Crittenden to the U.S. Supreme Court on December 17 , 1828 , but senators who supported president-elect Jackson voted to postpone confirmation until Jackson could nominate his own man . After his brief service as Kentucky secretary of state , the state legislature elected Crittenden to the second of his four non-consecutive stints in the U.S. Senate . Upon his election as president , William Henry Harrison appointed Crittenden as Attorney General , but five months after Harrison 's death , political differences prompted him to resign rather than continue his service under Harrison 's successor , John Tyler . He was returned to the Senate in 1842 , serving until 1848 , when he resigned to run for governor , hoping his election would help Zachary Taylor win Kentucky 's vote in the 1848 presidential election . Taylor was elected , but Crittenden refused a post in his cabinet , fearing he would be charged with making a corrupt bargain , as Clay had been in 1825 .
