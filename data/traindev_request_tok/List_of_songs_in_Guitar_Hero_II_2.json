  "/wiki/Indie_rock": "Indie rock is a genre of rock music that originated in the United States and United Kingdom in the 1970s . Originally used to describe independent record labels , the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock . As grunge and punk revival bands in the US and Britpop bands in the UK broke into the mainstream in the 1990s , it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective . In the 2000s , as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet , some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success , leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term . Sometimes used interchangeably with guitar pop rock , in the mid-1980s , the term indie ( or indie pop ) began to be used to describe the music produced on punk and post-punk labels . Some prominent indie rock record labels were founded during the 1980s . During the 1990s , grunge bands broke into the mainstream , and the term alternative lost its original counter-cultural meaning . The term indie rock became associated with the bands and genres that remained dedicated to their independent status . By the end of the 1990s , indie rock developed several subgenres and related styles , including lo-fi , noise pop , emo , slowcore , post-rock , and math rock . In the 2000s , changes in the music industry and in music technology enabled a new wave of indie rock bands to achieve mainstream success . In the early 2000s , a new group of bands that played a stripped-down , back-to-basics version of guitar rock emerged into the mainstream . The commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by four bands : The Strokes , The White Stripes , The Hives and The Vines .",
