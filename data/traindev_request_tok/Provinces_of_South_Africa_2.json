It covered an area of 7,700 square kilometres ( 3,000 sq mi ) , almost entirely surrounded by what was then the Cape Province , and possessed a small coastline along the shore of the Indian Ocean . Under South Africa 's policy of apartheid , land was set aside for black peoples in self-governing territories . Ciskei was designated as one of two homelands or Bantustans for Xhosa-speaking people . Ngqika ( Rharhabe ) Xhosa people were forcibly resettled in the Ciskei , and Gcaleka Xhosa were settled in the Transkei , the other Xhosa homeland . Unlike the other Bantustans , including Transkei , which saw itself as a Xhosa homeland , Ciskei has been described as having absolutely no basis in any ethnic , cultural or linguistic fact whatsoever despite efforts by the Ciskei authorities to create a distinctive Ciskeian identity . In contrast to the Transkei , which was largely contiguous and deeply rural , and governed by hereditary chiefs , the area that became the Ciskei had been made up of a patchwork of reserves interspersed with pockets of white-owned farms . There were elected headmen , it had a relatively educated working class populace and there was a tendency of the region 's black residents , who often worked in East London , Queenstown and King Williams Town , to oppose traditional methods of control . These differences have been posited as the reason for two separate homelands for the Xhosa people being developed , as well as the later nominal independence of Ciskei from South Africa , than Transkei . After its creation , large numbers of blacks were expelled from designed white areas in the Cape Province by the Apartheid government to Ciskei , in particular , non-productive Bantus-women with dependent children , the elderly , and the infirm , and it was also treated as a reservoir of cheap black labour .

Although the mandate was abolished by the UN in 1966 , South African rule continued despite it being illegal under international law . The territory was administered directly by the South African government from 1915 to 1978 , when the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference laid the groundwork for semi-autonomous rule . During an interim period between 1978 and 1985 , South Africa gradually granted South West Africa a limited form of home rule , culminating in the formation of a Transitional Government of National Unity . In 1990 , South West Africa was granted independence as the Republic of Namibia with the exception of Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands , which continued to remain under South African rule until 1994 .",
  "/wiki/Windhoek": "Windhoek ( /\u02c8w\u026andh\u028ak/ , Afrikaans : [ \u02c8v\u0259nt\u0266u\u02d0k ] , German : [ 'v\u026anth\u028ak ] ) is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Namibia . It is located in central Namibia in the Khomas Highland plateau area , at around 1,700 metres ( 5,600 ft ) above sea level , almost exactly at the country 's geographical centre . The population of Windhoek in 2011 was 325,858 , growing continually due to an influx from all over Namibia . The city developed at the site of a permanent hot spring known to the indigenous pastoral communities . It developed rapidly after Jonker Afrikaner , Captain of the Orlam , settled here in 1840 and built a stone church for his community . In the decades following , multiple wars and armed hostilities resulted in the neglect and destruction of the new settlement . Windhoek was founded a second time in 1890 by Imperial German Army Major Curt von Fran\u00e7ois , when the territory was colonised by the German Empire . Windhoek is the social , economic , political , and cultural centre of the country . Nearly every Namibian national enterprise , governmental body , educational and cultural institution is headquartered there ."
