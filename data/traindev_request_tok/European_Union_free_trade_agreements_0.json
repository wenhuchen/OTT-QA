  "/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union": "The European Union Customs Union ( EUCU ) is a customs union which consists of all the member states of the European Union ( EU ) , Monaco , the United Kingdom , and some dependencies of the United Kingdom which were not part of the EU . [ a ] Some detached territories of EU members do not participate in the customs union , usually as a result of their geographic separation . [ b ] In addition to the EUCU , the EU is in customs unions with Andorra , San Marino , and Turkey ( with the exceptions of certain goods ) , [ c ] through separate bilateral agreements . The customs union is a principal component of the European Union , since its establishment in 1958 as the European Economic Community . There are no tariffs or non-tariff barriers to trade between members of the customs union and - unlike a free trade area - members of the customs union impose a common external tariff on all goods entering the union . The European Commission negotiates for and on behalf of the Union as a whole in international trade deals ( such as that with Canada and many others ) , rather than each member state negotiating individually . It also represents the Union in the World Trade Organization and any trade disputes mediated through it . During the Brexit transition period the United Kingdom continues to function as a part of the Customs Union . As of February 2020 [ update ] , the United Kingdom 's relationship with the European Union after the end of the transition period remains to be negotiated .",

  "/wiki/European_Union_Association_Agreement": "A European Union Association Agreement ( for short , Association Agreement or AA ) is a treaty between the European Union ( EU ) , its Member States and a non-EU country that creates a framework for co-operation between them .

  "/wiki/Accession_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_to_the_European_Union": "The accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union is the stated aim of the present relations between the two entities . Bosnia and Herzegovina has been recognised by the EU as a potential candidate country for accession since the decision of the European Council in Thessaloniki in 2003 and is on the current agenda for future enlargement of the EU . Bosnia and Herzegovina takes part in the Stabilisation and Association Process and trade relations are regulated by an Interim Agreement . Bosnia and Herzegovina formally applied for EU membership on 15 February 2016 , following years of constitutional reforms and engagements with the Dayton Peace Agreement . The failure of Bosnia to meet the conditions for the closure of the Office of the High Representative ( OHR ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina , including addressing state and military property ownership issues and implementing constitutional reforms , had prevented the country from submitting an application until 2016 . On 9 December 2016 , Bosnia and Herzegovina received the accession questionnaire from the European Commission and the responses to the questionnaire were submitted in February 2018 . On 20 June 2018 , the European Commission sent 655 follow-up questions to the Questionnaire . Presidency Chairman of Bosnia and Herzegovina , Milorad Dodik , handed over the answers to the additional questions on March 5 , 2019 . An opinion on Bosnia 's application was published by the European Commission in May 2019 . 22 policy and political criteria questions were still unanswered when Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted its latest response on 5 March 2019 . It remains a potential candidate country until it can successfully answer all of the questions on the European Commission 's questionnaire sheet as well as ensure the functioning of the Stabilisation and Association Parliamentary Committee and develop a national programme for the adoption of the EU acquis . Many observers estimate that Bosnia and Herzegovina is at the bottom in terms of EU integration among the Western Balkans states seeking EU membership .",

The agreement with Ukraine was provisionally applied since 1 January 2016 and formally entered into force on 1 September 2017 . Unlike standard free trade areas , the DCFTA is aimed to offer the associated country the four freedoms of the EU Single Market : free movement of goods , services , capital , and people . Movement of people however , is in form of visa-free regime for short stay travel , while movement of workers remains within the remit of the EU Member States . The DCFTA is an example of the integration of a Non-EEA-Member into the EU Single Market . The European Parliament passed a resolution in 2014 stating that in accordance with Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union , Georgia , Moldova and Ukraine , as well as any other European country , have a European perspective and can apply for EU membership in compliance with the principles of democracy , respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights , minority rights and ensuring the rule of law , thus formally recognizing the possibility of a future EU membership of the three countries .",
