  "/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_Universe": "The accelerating expansion of the universe is the observation that the expansion of the universe is such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy is receding from the observer is continuously increasing with time . The accelerated expansion was discovered during 1998 , by two independent projects , the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team , which both used distant type Ia supernovae to measure the acceleration . The idea was that as type 1a supernovae have almost the same intrinsic brightness ( a standard candle ) , and since objects that are further away appear dimmer , we can use the observed brightness of these supernovae to measure the distance to them . The distance can then be compared to the supernovae 's cosmological redshift , which measures how much the universe has expanded since the supernova occurred . The unexpected result was that objects in the universe are moving away from one another at an accelerated rate . Cosmologists at the time expected that recession velocity would always be decelerating , due to the gravitational attraction of the matter in the universe . Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded Nobel Prizes for their discovery . Confirmatory evidence has been found in baryon acoustic oscillations , and in analyses of the clustering of galaxies . The accelerated expansion of the universe is thought to have begun since the universe entered its dark-energy-dominated era roughly 4 billion years ago . [ notes 1 ] Within the framework of general relativity , an accelerated expansion can be accounted for by a positive value of the cosmological constant \u039b , equivalent to the presence of a positive vacuum energy , dubbed dark energy . While there are alternative possible explanations , the description assuming dark energy ( positive \u039b ) is used in the current standard model of cosmology , which also includes cold dark matter ( CDM ) and is known as the Lambda-CDM model .",
  "/wiki/Supernova": "A supernova ( /\u02ccsu\u02d0p\u0259r\u02c8no\u028av\u0259/ plural : supernovae /\u02ccsu\u02d0p\u0259r\u02c8no\u028avi\u02d0/ or supernovas , abbreviations : SN and SNe ) is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion . This transient astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion . The original object , called the progenitor , either collapses to a neutron star or black hole , or it is completely destroyed . The peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy , before fading over several weeks or months . Supernovae are more energetic than novae . In Latin , nova means new , referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star . Adding the prefix super- distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae , which are far less luminous . The word supernova was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1931 . The most recent directly observed supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler 's Supernova in 1604 , but the remnants of more recent supernovae have been found . Observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur in the Milky Way on average about three times every century . These supernovae would almost certainly be observable with modern astronomical telescopes . The most recent naked-eye supernova was SN 1987A , the explosion of a blue supergiant star in the Large Magellanic Cloud , a satellite of the Milky Way .",

  "/wiki/Chromosomes": "A chromosome is a deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) molecule with part or all of the genetic material ( genome ) of an organism . Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins which , aided by chaperone proteins , bind to and condense the DNA molecule to prevent it from becoming an unmanageable tangle . This three-dimensional genome structure plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation . Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division ( where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form ) . Before this happens , every chromosome is copied once ( S phase ) , and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere , resulting either in an X-shaped structure ( pictured here ) if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends . The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids . During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome . In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study . In animal cells , chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during chromosome segregation . Chromosomal recombination during meiosis and subsequent sexual reproduction play a significant role in genetic diversity . If these structures are manipulated incorrectly , through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation , the cell may undergo mitotic catastrophe . Usually , this will make the cell initiate apoptosis leading to its own death , but sometimes mutations in the cell hamper this process and thus cause progression of cancer .",
  "/wiki/Telomeres": "A telomere ( /\u02c8t\u025bl\u0259m\u026a\u0259r/ or /\u02c8t\u026al\u0259m\u026a\u0259r/ ) is a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromosome , which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes . Its name is derived from the Greek nouns telos ( \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ) end and mer\u03bfs ( \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 , root : \u03bc\u03b5\u03c1- ) part . For vertebrates , the sequence of nucleotides in telomeres is AGGGTT , with the complementary DNA strand being TCCCAA , with a single-stranded TTAGGG overhang . This sequence of TTAGGG is repeated approximately 2,500 times in humans . In humans , average telomere length declines from about 11 kilobases at birth to fewer than 4 kilobases in old age , with the average rate of decline being greater in men than in women . During chromosome replication , the enzymes that duplicate DNA can not continue their duplication all the way to the end of a chromosome , so in each duplication the end of the chromosome is shortened ( this is because the synthesis of Okazaki fragments requires RNA primers attaching ahead on the lagging strand ) . The telomeres are disposable buffers at the ends of chromosomes which are truncated during cell division ; their presence protects the genes before them on the chromosome from being truncated instead . The telomeres themselves are protected by a complex of shelterin proteins , as well as by the RNA that telomeric DNA encodes ( TERRA ) . Over time , due to each cell division , the telomere ends become shorter . They are replenished by an enzyme , telomerase reverse transcriptase .",
  "/wiki/Telomerase": "Telomerase , also called terminal transferase , is a ribonucleoprotein that adds a species-dependent telomere repeat sequence to the 3 ' end of telomeres . A telomere is a region of repetitive sequences at each end of eukaryotic chromosomes in most eukaryotes . Telomeres protect the end of the chromosome from DNA damage or from fusion with neighbouring chromosomes . The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster lacks telomerase , but instead uses retrotransposons to maintain telomeres . Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase enzyme that carries its own RNA molecule ( e.g. , with the sequence 3\u2032-CCCAAUCCC-5\u2032 in Trypanosoma brucei ) which is used as a template when it elongates telomeres .

Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth , and are present in most of its habitats . Bacteria inhabit soil , water , acidic hot springs , radioactive waste , and the deep biosphere of the earth 's crust . Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals . Most bacteria have not been characterised , and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory . The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology , a branch of microbiology . Virtually all animal life on earth is dependent on bacteria for their survival as only bacteria and some archea possess the genes and enzymes necessary to synthesize vitamin B12 , also known as cobalamin , and provide it through the food chain . Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body . It is a cofactor in DNA synthesis , and in both fatty acid and amino acid metabolism . It is particularly important in the normal functioning of the nervous system via its role in the synthesis of myelin .",
  "/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori": "Helicobacter pylori , previously known as Campylobacter pylori , is a gram-negative , helically-shaped , microaerophilic bacterium usually found in the stomach . Its helical shape ( from which the genus name , helicobacter , derives ) is thought to have evolved in order to penetrate the mucoid lining of the stomach and thereby establish infection . The bacterium was first identified in 1982 by Australian doctors Barry Marshall and Robin Warren , who found that it was present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers , conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause . H. pylori has also been linked to the development of duodenal ulcers , polyps , i. e. benign growths , in the small intestine , large intestine , and rectum , and malignancies of the stomach 's secretory glands ( termed stomach adenocarcinoma ) , of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the stomach , esophagus , colon , rectum , or tissues around the eye ( termed extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the cited organ ) , and of lymphoid tissue in the stomach ( termed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ) . Many investigators have proposed causal associations between H. pylori and a wide range of other diseases ( e.g . idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , iron deficiency anemia , atherosclerosis , Alzheimer 's disease , multiple sclerosis , coronary artery disease , periodontitis , Parkinson 's disease , Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome , rosacea , psoriasis , chronic urticaria , spot baldness , various autoimmune skin diseases , Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura , low blood levels of vitamin B12 , autoimmune neutropenia , the antiphospholipid syndrome , plasma cell dyscrasias , central serous chorioretinitis , open angle glaucoma , blepharitis , diabetes mellitus , the metabolic syndrome , various types of allergies , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , non-alcoholic steatohepatitis , hepatic fibrosis , and liver cancer ) . The bacterial infection has also been proposed to have protective effects for its hosts against infections by other pathogens , asthma , obesity , celiac disease , inflammatory bowel disease , rhinitis , atopic dermatitis , gastroesophageal reflux disease , and esophageal cancer . However , these deleterious and protective effects have frequently been based on correlative rather than direct relationship studies and have often been contradicted by other studies that show either the opposite or no effect on the cited disease . Consequently , many of these relationships are currently regarded as questionable and in need of more definitive studes . They are not considered further here .

Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life . :8.1 Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps . The study of enzymes is called enzymology and a new field of pseudoenzyme analysis has recently grown up , recognising that during evolution , some enzymes have lost the ability to carry out biological catalysis , which is often reflected in their amino acid sequences and unusual 'pseudocatalytic ' properties . Enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types . Other biocatalysts are catalytic RNA molecules , called ribozymes .

Townes , Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov were awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for theoretical work leading to the maser . Masers are used as the timekeeping device in atomic clocks , and as extremely low-noise microwave amplifiers in radio telescopes and deep space spacecraft communication ground stations . Modern masers can be designed to generate electromagnetic waves at not only microwave frequencies but also radio and infrared frequencies . For this reason Charles Townes suggested replacing microwave with the word molecular as the first word in the acronym maser . The laser works by the same principle as the maser , but produces higher frequency coherent radiation at visible wavelengths . The maser was the forerunner of the laser , inspiring theoretical work by Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow that led to the invention of the laser in 1960 by Theodore Maiman . When the coherent optical oscillator was first imagined in 1957 , it was originally called the optical maser .

  "/wiki/Laser": "A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation . The term laser originated as an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation . The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories , based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow . A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light which is coherent . Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot , enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography . Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances ( collimation ) , enabling applications such as laser pointers and lidar . Lasers can also have high temporal coherence , which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum , i.e. , they can emit a single color of light . Alternatively , temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light with a broad spectrum but durations as short as a femtosecond ( ultrashort pulses ) . Lasers are used in optical disk drives , laser printers , barcode scanners , DNA sequencing instruments , fiber-optic , semiconducting chip manufacturing ( photolithography ) , and free-space optical communication , laser surgery and skin treatments , cutting and welding materials , military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed , and in laser lighting displays for entertainment .

A cation is a positively charged ion , with fewer electrons than protons , while an anion is negatively charged , with more electrons than protons . Because of their opposite electric charges , cations and anions attract each other and readily form ionic compounds . Ions consisting of only a single atom are termed atomic or monatomic ions , while two or more atoms form molecular ions or polyatomic ions . In the case of physical ionization in a fluid ( gas or liquid ) , ion pairs are created by spontaneous molecule collisions , where each generated pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion . Ions are also created by chemical interactions , such as the dissolution of a salt in liquids , or by other means , such as passing a direct current through a conducting solution , dissolving an anode via ionization .",
  "/wiki/Nerve_cell": "A neuron , neurone ( old British spelling ) or nerve cell , is an electrically excitable cell that communicates with other cells via specialized connections called synapses . It is the main component of nervous tissue in all animals except sponges and placozoa . Plants and fungi do not have nerve cells . Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their function . Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch , sound , or light that affect the cells of the sensory organs , and they send signals to the spinal cord or brain . Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions to glandular output . Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord . A group of connected neurons is called a neural circuit . A typical neuron consists of a cell body ( soma ) , dendrites , and a single axon . The soma is usually compact . The axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it . Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few hundred micrometers from the soma .",

  "/wiki/Andrew_F._Huxley": "Sir Andrew Fielding Huxley OM PRS ( 22 November 1917 - 30 May 2012 ) was an English physiologist and biophysicist . He was born into the prominent Huxley family . After graduating from Westminster School in Central London , from where he won a scholarship to Trinity College , Cambridge , he joined Alan Lloyd Hodgkin to study nerve impulses . Their eventual discovery of the basis for propagation of nerve impulses ( called an action potential ) earned them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963 . They made their discovery from the giant axon of the Atlantic squid . Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War , Huxley was recruited by the British Anti-Aircraft Command and later transferred to the Admiralty . After the war he resumed research at The University of Cambridge , where he developed interference microscopy that would be suitable for studying muscle fibres . In 1952 , he was joined by a German physiologist Rolf Niedergerke . Together they discovered in 1954 the mechanism of muscle contraction , popularly called the sliding filament theory , which is the foundation of our modern understanding of muscle mechanics . In 1960 he became head of the Department of Physiology at University College London . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1955 , and President in 1980 . The Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal in 1973 for his collective contributions to the understanding of nerve impulses and muscle contraction .",
  "/wiki/Frank_Macfarlane_Burnet": "Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet , OM , AK , KBE , FRS , FAA , FRSNZ ( 3 September 1899 - 31 August 1985 ) , usually known as Macfarlane or Mac Burnet , was an Australian virologist best known for his contributions to immunology . He won a Nobel Prize in 1960 for predicting acquired immune tolerance and was best known for developing the theory of clonal selection . Burnet received his Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Melbourne in 1924 , and his PhD from the University of London in 1928 . He went on to conduct pioneering research in microbiology and immunology at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research , Melbourne , and served as director of the Institute from 1944 to 1965 . From 1965 until his retirement in 1978 , Burnet worked at the University of Melbourne . Throughout his career he played an active role in the development of public policy for the medical sciences in Australia and was a founding member of the Australian Academy of Science ( AAS ) , and served as its president from 1965 to 1969 . Burnet 's major achievements in microbiology included discovering the causative agents of Q-fever and psittacosis ; developing assays for the isolation , culture and detection of influenza virus ; describing the recombination of influenza strains ; demonstrating that the myxomatosis virus does not cause disease in humans . Modern methods for producing influenza vaccines are still based on Burnet 's work improving virus growing processes in hen 's eggs . Burnet was the most highly decorated and honoured scientist to have worked in Australia . For his contributions to Australian science , he was made the first Australian of the Year in 1960 , and in 1978 a Knight of the Order of Australia . He was recognised internationally for his achievements : in addition to the Nobel , he received the Lasker Award and the Royal and Copley Medal from the Royal Society , honorary doctorates , and distinguished service honours from the Commonwealth of Nations and Japan .",
  "/wiki/Immunological_tolerance": "Immune tolerance , or immunological tolerance , or immunotolerance , is a state of unresponsiveness of the immune system to substances or tissue that have the capacity to elicit an immune response in a given organism . It is induced by prior exposure to that specific antigen and contrasts with conventional immune-mediated elimination of foreign antigens ( see Immune response ) . Tolerance is classified into central tolerance or peripheral tolerance depending on where the state is originally induced - in the thymus and bone marrow ( central ) or in other tissues and lymph nodes ( peripheral ) . The mechanisms by which these forms of tolerance are established are distinct , but the resulting effect is similar . Immune tolerance is important for normal physiology . Central tolerance is the main way the immune system learns to discriminate self from non-self . Peripheral tolerance is key to preventing over-reactivity of the immune system to various environmental entities ( allergens , gut microbes , etc. ) . Deficits in central or peripheral tolerance also cause autoimmune disease , resulting in syndromes such as systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , type 1 diabetes , autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 ( APS-1 ) , and immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome ( IPEX ) , and potentially contribute to asthma , allergy , and inflammatory bowel disease . And immune tolerance in pregnancy is what allows a mother animal to gestate a genetically distinct offspring with an alloimmune response muted enough to prevent miscarriage . Tolerance , however , also has its negative tradeoffs . It allows for some pathogenic microbes to successfully infect a host and avoid elimination . In addition , inducing peripheral tolerance in the local microenvironment is a common survival strategy for a number of tumors that prevents their elimination by the host immune system .",
  "/wiki/Peter_Medawar": "Sir Peter Brian Medawar OM CBE FRS ( /\u02c8m\u025bd\u0259w\u0259r/ ; 28 February 1915 - 2 October 1987 ) was a British biologist and writer , whose work on graft rejection and the discovery of acquired immune tolerance was fundamental to the medical practice of tissue and organ transplants . For his scientific works he is regarded as the father of transplantation . He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings . Famous zoologists such as Richard Dawkins referred to him as the wittiest of all scientific writers , and Stephen Jay Gould as the cleverest man I have ever known . Medawar was the younger son of a Lebanese father and a British mother , and was both Brazilian and British citizen by birth . He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College , Oxford and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London . Until he was partially disabled by a cerebral infarction , he was Director of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill . With his doctoral student Leslie Brent and postdoctoral fellow Rupert E. Billingham , he demonstrated the principle of acquired immunological tolerance ( the phenomenon of unresponsiveness of the immune system to certain molecules ) , which was theoretically predicted by Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet . This became the foundation of tissue and organ transplantation . He and Burnet shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance .",
  "/wiki/Howard_Florey": "Howard Walter Florey , Baron Florey , OM , FRS , FRCP ( 24 September 1898 - 21 February 1968 ) was an Australian pharmacologist and pathologist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 with Sir Ernst Chain and Sir Alexander Fleming for his role in the development of penicillin . Although Fleming received most of the credit for the discovery of penicillin , it was Florey who carried out the first ever clinical trials of penicillin in 1941 at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford on the first patient , a police constable from Oxford . The patient started to recover , but subsequently died because Florey was unable , at that time , to make enough penicillin . It was Florey and Chain who actually made a useful and effective drug out of penicillin , after the task had been abandoned as too difficult . Florey 's discoveries , along with the discoveries of Fleming and Ernst Chain , are estimated to have saved over 200 million lives , and he is consequently regarded by the Australian scientific and medical community as one of its greatest figures . Sir Robert Menzies , Australia 's longest-serving Prime Minister , said , In terms of world well-being , Florey was the most important man ever born in Australia .",
  "/wiki/Penicillin": "Penicillin ( PCN or pen ) is a group of antibiotics , derived originally from common moulds known as Penicillium moulds ; which includes penicillin G ( intravenous use ) , penicillin V ( use by mouth ) , procaine penicillin , and benzathine penicillin ( intramuscular use ) . Penicillin antibiotics were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci . They are still widely used today , though many types of bacteria have developed resistance following extensive use . About 10% of people report that they are allergic to penicillin ; however , up to 90% of this group may not actually be allergic . Serious allergies only occur in about 0.03% . Those who are allergic to penicillin are most often given cephalosporin C because of its functional groups . All penicillins are \u03b2-lactam antibiotics , which are some of the most powerful and successful achievements in modern science . Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming . People began using it to treat infections in 1942 . There are several enhanced penicillin families which are effective against additional bacteria ; these include the antistaphylococcal penicillins , aminopenicillins and the antipseudomonal penicillins . They are derived from Penicillium fungi .",
