  "/wiki/Puerto_Chicama": "Malabrigo also called unofficially Puerto Chicama , is a port and small coastal town in northwestern Peru , located in La Libertad Region , some 70 km north of Trujillo city . ( Google Earth also confirms these distances . In comparison , Tracks magazine has stated that a wave has been ridden at the Superbank on the Gold Coast in Australia for 1.97km ) . The distance from 'the point ' to 'the pier ' at Chicama is about 2.2 km , which locals confirm has been ridden on a single wave , although the whole cape upon which the waves break , to their most westernmost end , is 4 km long . Although other waves break further up the cape from the main section of the point , ( including Malpaso ( up to a few hundred metres ) and Keys ( up to 600m or so ) apparently nobody has ridden a single wave the length of the whole 4 km cape at Chicama , as deep water does not allow a single ride along the length of the first 1.8 km or so ."
