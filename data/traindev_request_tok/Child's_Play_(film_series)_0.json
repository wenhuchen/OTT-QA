The company was launched in August 1998 by three undergraduate students at the University of California , Berkeley : Senh Duong , Patrick Y. Lee , and Stephen Wang .

Since January 2010 , Rotten Tomatoes has been owned by Flixster , which was in turn acquired by Warner Bros. in 2011 . In February 2016 , Rotten Tomatoes and its parent site Flixster were sold to Comcast 's Fandango . Warner Bros. retained a minority stake in the merged entities , including Fandango .",
