He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of the god Vishnu and also as the supreme God in his own right . He is the god of compassion , tenderness , and love in Hinduism , and is one of the most popular and widely revered among Indian divinities . Krishna 's birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar , which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar . In Krishna Charitas , Krishna is born to Devaki and her husband , Vasudeva Anakadundubhi of the Yadava clan in Mathura . Krishna is usually depicted with a flute in his hand . The current tradition of the monotheistic cult of Krishna , is the result of the amalgamation of several ancient traditions , particularly the originally independent cults of V\u0101sudeva-Krishna , Gopala-Krishna and Bala-Krishna , as well as Bhagavatism . The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna 's life are generally titled as Krishna Leela . He is a central character in the Mahabharata , the Bhagavata Purana and the Bhagavad Gita , and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical , theological , and mythological texts . They portray him in various perspectives : a god-child , a prankster , a model lover , a divine hero , and as the universal supreme being . His iconography reflects these legends , and shows him in different stages of his life , such as an infant eating butter , a young boy playing a flute , a young boy with Radha or surrounded by women devotees , or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna .
