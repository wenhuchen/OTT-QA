  "/wiki/Andrei_Rublev_(film)": "Andrei Rublev ( Russian : \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0451\u0432 , originally pronounced Rublyov ) is a 1969 Soviet biographical historical drama film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky and co-written with Andrei Konchalovsky . The film was remade and re-edited from the 1966 film titled The Passion According to Andrei by Tarkovsky which was censored during the first decade of the Brezhnev era in the Soviet Union . The film is loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev , the 15th-century Russian icon painter . The film features Anatoly Solonitsyn , Nikolai Grinko , Ivan Lapikov , Nikolai Sergeyev , Nikolai Burlyayev and Tarkovsky 's wife Irma Raush . Savva Yamshchikov , a famous Russian restorer and art historian , was a scientific consultant of the film . Andrei Rublev is set against the background of 15th-century Russia . Although the film is only loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev , it seeks to depict a realistic portrait of medieval Russia . Tarkovsky sought to create a film that shows the artist as a world-historic figure and Christianity as an axiom of Russia 's historical identity during a turbulent period of Russian history that ultimately resulted in the Tsardom of Russia . The film 's themes include artistic freedom , religion , political ambiguity , autodidacticism , and the making of art under a repressive regime . Because of this , it was not released domestically in the officially atheist Soviet Union for years after it was completed , except for a single 1966 screening in Moscow . A version of the film was shown at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival , where it won the FIPRESCI prize . In 1971 , a censored version of the film was released in the Soviet Union .",

Solyaris ) is a 1972 Soviet science fiction art film based on Stanis\u0142aw Lem 's novel of the same name published in 1961 . The film was co-written and directed by Andrei Tarkovsky , and stars Donatas Banionis and Natalya Bondarchuk . The electronic music score was performed by Eduard Artemyev ; a composition by J.S . Bach is also employed . The plot centers on a space station orbiting the fictional planet Solaris , where a scientific mission has stalled because the skeleton crew of three scientists have fallen into emotional crises . Psychologist Kris Kelvin ( Banionis ) travels to the station in order to evaluate the situation , only to encounter the same mysterious phenomena as the others . The film was Tarkovsky 's attempt to bring a new emotional and intellectual depth to the science fiction genre ; he viewed most western works in the genre as shallow due to their focus on technological invention . Solaris won the Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury and the FIPRESCI prize at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Palme d'Or . It is often cited as one of the greatest science fiction films in the history of cinema . Some of the ideas Tarkovsky expresses in this film are further developed in his Stalker ( 1979 ) .",
