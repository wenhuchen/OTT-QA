The conference includes the flagship public university in each of 11 states stretching from New Jersey to Nebraska , as well as two additional public land-grant schools and a private university . The Big Ten Conference was established in 1895 when Purdue University president James H. Smart and representatives from the University of Chicago , University of Illinois , University of Michigan , University of Minnesota , Northwestern University , and University of Wisconsin gathered at Chicago 's Palmer House Hotel to set policies aimed at regulating intercollegiate athletics . In 1899 , Indiana University and the University of Iowa joined the conference to increase the membership to nine schools . In 1905 , the conference was officially incorporated as the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives . The conference is one of the nation 's oldest , predating the founding of the NCAA by a decade , and was one of the first collegiate conferences to sponsor men 's basketball . Big Ten member institutions are major research universities with large financial endowments and strong academic reputations . All institutions except full member University of Nebraska and associate member Notre Dame are members of the Association of American Universities .

  "/wiki/Big_East_Conference_(1979\u20132013)": "The Big East Conference was a collegiate athletics conference that consisted of as many as 16 universities in the eastern half of the United States from 1979 to 2013 . The conference 's members participated in 24 NCAA sports . The conference had a history of success at the national level in basketball throughout its history , while its shorter ( 1991 to 2013 ) football program , created by inviting one college and four other associate members ( their football programs only ) into the conference , resulted in two national championships . In basketball , Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won seven NCAA Championships ( UConn with three , Villanova , Georgetown , Syracuse , and Louisville with one each ) . Of the Big East 's full members , all but South Florida attended the Final Four , the most of any conference , though Marquette , DePaul , Notre Dame , Rutgers , Cincinnati , and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East . In 2011 , the Big East set the record for the most teams sent to the NCAA Division I Men 's Basketball Championship by a single conference with eleven out of their sixteen teams qualifying . In football , the Big East entered competition as a conference in 1991 , after inviting five football colleges to become members of the Big East , joining three teams from the Big East whose football teams were competing as Division I independents ( Boston College , Pittsburgh and Syracuse ) to form a new Division I football league . The strength of this league earned the Big East an automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series , when that series was created in 1998 . The Big East won two national football championships , both by University of Miami . Between 2005 and 2012 , four of the more successful football schools left the Big East for other conferences , starting a process that led to a complete realignment of the Big East in 2013 . On July 1 , 2013 , the non-football playing schools ( also known collectively as the secular Catholic 7 ) formed a non-football playing conference that retains the Big East Conference name . The remaining six football-playing members , three of whom had only joined the Big East in 2005 when the earlier exodus had started , joined with four schools from other conferences to become the American Athletic Conference ( The American ) , which is the Big East 's legal successor .",
  "/wiki/2001_Carolina_Panthers_season": "The 2001 Carolina Panthers season was the franchise 's 7th season in the National Football League and the 3rd and final under head coach George Seifert . They tried to improve upon their 7-9 record in 2000 , and make it to the playoffs for the second time in franchise history ; however , the season was a wreck . Not only were the Panthers unable to improve over their previous season , but they deteriorated even further dropping to 1-15 , losing 15 straight after beating the Minnesota Vikings in their opening game of the season . No other team before or since has lost fifteen straight after opening the season with a big win : the only other teams in NFL history to win their opener and lose the remainder of their games are the 1936 Philadelphia Eagles and the 1969 Pittsburgh Steelers , both in the pre-Merger era and before the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978 . The only teams to nearly suffer the same fate as the 2001 Panthers include the 2013 Houston Texans , the 2014 Tennessee Titans , and the 2016 San Francisco 49ers , all of whom had won their season openers but finished 2-14 respectively . The Panthers consequently beat the record for most consecutive losses during a single NFL season shared by the 1976 Buccaneers , the 1980 Saints , the 1981 Colts and the 1990 Patriots . This has since been broken by two winless teams : the 2008 Detroit Lions and 2017 Cleveland Browns . Following their terrible season , head coach George Seifert was fired and replaced by John Fox . By the end of the season , the Panthers had become so incapacitated that only about 16,000 fans showed up to see them play in their finale against the New England Patriots , who shockingly went on to win Super Bowl XXXVI over the 14-2 Rams . Coincidentally , the Panthers would face the Patriots 2 seasons later in Super Bowl XXXVIII , which saw the Panthers lose 29-32 . The 2001 Panthers became the seventh of eight teams to finish 1-15 after last year 's Chargers , the 1996 Jets , 1991 Colts , 1990 Patriots , 1989 Cowboys and the 1980 Saints .

Typically , fullbacks are larger than halfback and in most offensive schemes their duties are split between power running , pass catching , and blocking for both the quarterback and the other running back . Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks . Examples of players who have excelled at the hybrid running-blocking-pass catching role include Mike Alstott , Daryl Johnston , and Lorenzo Neal .",

  "/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)": "Safety , historically known as a safetyman , is a position in gridiron football played by a member of the defense . The safeties are defensive backs who line up from ten to fifteen yards from the line of scrimmage . There are two variations of the position in a typical American formation : the free safety ( FS ) and the strong safety ( SS ) . Their duties depend on the defensive scheme . The defensive responsibilities of the safety and cornerback usually involve pass coverage towards the middle and sidelines of the field , respectively . While American ( 11-player ) formations generally use two safeties , Canadian ( 12-player ) formations generally have one safety and two defensive halfbacks , a position not used in the American game . As professional and college football have become more focused on the passing game , safeties have become more involved in covering the eligible pass receivers . Safeties are the last line of defense ; they are expected to be reliable tacklers , and many safeties rank among the hardest hitters in football . Safety positions can also be converted cornerbacks , either by design ( Byron Jones ) or as a cornerback ages ( Charles Woodson , DeAngelo Hall , Lardarius Webb , Tramon Williams ) . Historically , in the era of the one-platoon system , the safety was known as the defensive fullback ( specifically the free safety ; the strong safety would be a defensive halfback , a term still in Canadian parlance ) or goaltender .",

  "/wiki/Long_snapper": "In gridiron football , the long snapper ( or deep snapper ) is a special teams specialist whose duty is to snap the football over a longer distance , typically around 15 yards during punts , and 7-8 yards during field goals and extra point attempts . During field goal and point after touchdown attempts , the snap is received by the holder , typically 7-8 yards away . During punts , the snap is delivered to the punter from 13-15 yards away . Following a punt snap , the snapper often executes a blocking assignment and then must cover the kick by running downfield and attempting to stop the opposing team 's punt returner from advancing the ball in the opposite direction . If the punt goes uncaught , it is the snapper 's responsibility to make sure the ball does not enter the end zone or bounce backward resulting in loss of yards . The majority of snappers at the highest levels of competition are specialized , meaning that they uniquely play the position of snapper , or have limited responsibilities elsewhere . A good punt snap should hit the target -- the punter 's hands at the abdomen or waistline -- between .65 and .75 seconds and with a tight spiral for easy handling . A bad snap is an off-target snap which causes the delay or failure of a kick or forces the punter into some other potentially compromising situation .",

In the second game of the regular season , nine-year starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe , who had received a 10-year contract extension in March , was injured on a hit by New York Jets linebacker Mo Lewis , causing backup Tom Brady , a sixth-round draft pick in 2000 , to enter the game .

As a result , the Patriots became only the 2nd team in NFL history to win the Super Bowl after starting the season 2-3 , behind the 1980 Oakland Raiders . With the second seed in the AFC playoffs , the Patriots faced the Oakland Raiders at home following a first-round bye in the final game at Foxboro Stadium ; in a snowstorm , a Patriots drive late in the fourth quarter was kept alive in an application of the now-famous tuck rule that was used in overturning a Brady fumble into an incomplete pass . Shortly after , a 45-yard Adam Vinatieri field goal through the snow , considered one of the most clutch field goals in NFL history , sent the game into overtime , when another Vinatieri field goal won it . After defeating the top-seeded Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game , the Patriots faced the heavily favored St. Louis Rams , known as The Greatest Show on Turf , in Super Bowl XXXVI .

On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations .
