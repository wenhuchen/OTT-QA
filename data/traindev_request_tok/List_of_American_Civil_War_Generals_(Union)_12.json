It is the 31st most extensive and the 25th most populous of the 50 United States . Louisiana is bordered by the state of Texas to the west , Arkansas to the north , Mississippi to the east , and the Gulf of Mexico to the south . A large part of its eastern boundary is demarcated by the Mississippi River . Louisiana is the only U.S. state with political subdivisions termed parishes , which are equivalent to counties . The state 's capital is Baton Rouge , and its largest city is New Orleans . Much of the state 's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River , leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp . [ self-published source ] These contain a rich southern biota ; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets . There are also many species of tree frogs , and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish . In more elevated areas , fire is a natural process in the landscape and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas . These support an exceptionally large number of plant species , including many species of terrestrial orchids and carnivorous plants . Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state , including four that are federally recognized , ten that are state recognized , and four that have not received recognition .",
  "/wiki/George_B._McClellan": "George Brinton McClellan ( December 3 , 1826 - October 29 , 1885 ) was an American soldier , civil engineer , railroad executive , and politician . A graduate of West Point , McClellan served with distinction during the Mexican-American War ( 1846-1848 ) , and later left the Army to work in railroads until the outbreak of the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) . Early in the conflict , McClellan was appointed to the rank of major general and played an important role in raising a well-trained and organized army , which would become the Army of the Potomac in the Eastern Theater ; he served a brief period ( November 1861 to March 1862 ) as general-in-chief of the Union Army . McClellan organized and led the Union army in the Peninsula Campaign in southeastern Virginia from March through July 1862 . It was the first large-scale offensive in the Eastern Theater . Making an amphibious clockwise turning movement around the Confederate Army in northern Virginia , McClellan 's forces turned west to move up the Virginia Peninsula , between the James and York Rivers , landing from the Chesapeake Bay , with the Confederate capital , Richmond , as their objective . Initially , McClellan was somewhat successful against General Joseph E. Johnston , but the emergence of General Robert E. Lee to command the Army of Northern Virginia turned the subsequent Seven Days Battles into a partial Union defeat . However , historians note that Lee 's victory was in many ways pyrrhic as he failed to destroy the Army of the Potomac and suffered a bloody repulse at Malvern Hill . General McClellan and President Abraham Lincoln developed a mutual distrust , and McClellan was privately derisive of his commander-in-chief . McClellan was removed from command in November in the aftermath of the 1862 midterm elections . This decision contributed to McClellan 's failure to decisively pursue Lee 's Army following the tactically inconclusive but strategic Union victory at the Battle of Antietam outside Sharpsburg , Maryland . McClellan never received another field command and went on to become the unsuccessful Democratic Party nominee in the 1864 presidential election against the Republican Lincoln 's reelection .",
  "/wiki/Commanding_General_of_the_United_States_Army": "Prior to the institution of the Chief of Staff of the Army in 1903 , there was generally recognized to be a single senior-most officer in the United States Army ( and its predecessor the Continental Army ) , even though there was not a statutory office as such . During the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) , the title was Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army . In 1783 , the title was simplified to Senior Officer of the United States Army . In 1821 , the title was changed to Commanding General of the United States Army . The office was often referred to by various other titles , such as Major General Commanding the Army or General-in-Chief . From 1789 until its abolition in 1903 , the position of Commanding General was legally subordinate to the Secretary of War . The position was abolished with the creation of the statutory Chief of Staff of the Army in 1903 .",

He was a prominent Democratic politician in Illinois and a member of the United States House of Representatives before the war . McClernand was firmly dedicated to the principles of Jacksonian democracy and supported the Compromise of 1850 . McClernand was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers in 1861 . His was a classic case of the politician-in-uniform coming into conflict with career Army officers , graduates of the United States Military Academy . He served as a subordinate commander under Ulysses S. Grant in the Western Theater , fighting in the battles of Belmont , Fort Donelson , and Shiloh in 1861-62 . A close friend and political ally of Abraham Lincoln , McClernand was given permission to recruit a force to conduct an operation against Vicksburg , Mississippi , which would rival the effort of Grant , his department commander . Grant was able to neutralize McClernand 's independent effort after it conducted an expedition to win the Battle of Arkansas Post , and McClernand became the senior corps commander in Grant 's army for the Vicksburg Campaign in 1863 . During the Siege of Vicksburg , Grant relieved McClernand of his command by citing his intemperate and unauthorized communication with the press , finally putting an end to a rivalry that had caused Grant discomfort since the beginning of the war . McClernand left the Army in 1864 and served as a judge and a politician in the postbellum era .",
  "/wiki/Illinois": "Illinois ( /\u02cc\u026al\u0259\u02c8n\u0254\u026a/ ( listen ) IL-\u0259-NOY ) is a state in the Midwestern and Great Lakes Regions of the United States . It has the fifth largest gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sixth largest population , and the 25th largest land area of all U.S. states . Illinois has been noted as a microcosm of the entire United States . With Chicago in northeastern Illinois , small industrial cities and immense agricultural productivity in the north and center of the state , and natural resources such as coal , timber , and petroleum in the south , Illinois has a diverse economic base , and is a major transportation hub . Chicagoland , Chicago 's metropolitan area , encompasses over 65% of the state 's population . The Port of Chicago connects the state to international ports via two main routes : from the Great Lakes , via the Saint Lawrence Seaway , to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River , via the Illinois Waterway to the Illinois River . The Mississippi River , the Ohio River , and the Wabash River form parts of the boundaries of Illinois . For decades , Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world 's busiest airports . Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and , through the 1980s , in politics . The capital of Illinois is Springfield , which is located in the central part of the state . Although today Illinois 's largest population center is in its northeast , the state 's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River , when the region was known as Illinois Country and was part of New France . Following the American Revolutionary War , American settlers began arriving from Kentucky in the 1780s via the Ohio River , and the population grew from south to north .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Cold_Harbor": "The Battle of Cold Harbor was fought during the American Civil War near Mechanicsville , Virginia , from May 31 to June 12 , 1864 , with the most significant fighting occurring on June 3 . It was one of the final battles of Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant 's Overland Campaign , and is remembered as one of American history 's bloodiest , most lopsided battles . Thousands of Union soldiers were killed or wounded in a hopeless frontal assault against the fortified positions of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's army . On May 31 , as Grant 's army once again swung around the right flank of Lee 's army , Union cavalry seized the crossroads of Old Cold Harbor , about 10 miles northeast of the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , holding it against Confederate attacks until the Union infantry arrived . Both Grant and Lee , whose armies had suffered enormous casualties in the Overland Campaign , received reinforcements . On the evening of June 1 , the Union VI Corps and XVIII Corps arrived and assaulted the Confederate works to the west of the crossroads with some success . On June 2 , the remainder of both armies arrived and the Confederates built an elaborate series of fortifications 7 miles long . At dawn on June 3 , three Union corps attacked the Confederate works on the southern end of the line and were easily repulsed with heavy casualties . Attempts to assault the northern end of the line and to resume the assaults on the southern were unsuccessful . Grant said of the battle in his Personal Memoirs , I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made . .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Kennesaw_Mountain": "The Battle of Kennesaw Mountain was fought on June 27 , 1864 , during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War . It was the most significant frontal assault launched by Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman against the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Gen. Joseph E. Johnston , ending in a tactical defeat for the Union forces . Strategically , however , the battle failed to deliver the result that the Confederacy desperately needed - namely a halt to Sherman 's advance on Atlanta . Sherman 's 1864 campaign against Atlanta , Georgia , was initially characterized by a series of flanking maneuvers against Johnston , each of which compelled the Confederate army to withdraw from heavily fortified positions with minimal casualties on either side . After two months and 70 miles ( 110 km ) of such maneuvering , Sherman 's path was blocked by imposing fortifications on Kennesaw Mountain , near Marietta , Georgia , and the Union general chose to change his tactics and ordered a large-scale frontal assault on June 27 , 1864 . Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson feinted against the northern end of Kennesaw Mountain , while his corps under Maj. Gen. John A. Logan assaulted Pigeon Hill on its southwest corner . At the same time , Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas launched strong attacks against Cheatham Hill at the center of the Confederate line . Both attacks were repulsed with heavy losses , but a demonstration by Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield achieved a strategic success by threatening the Confederate army 's left flank , prompting yet another Confederate withdrawal toward Atlanta and the removal of General Johnston from command of the army .",
