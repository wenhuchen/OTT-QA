  "/wiki/Art": "Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual , auditory or performing artifacts ( artworks ) , expressing the author 's imaginative , conceptual ideas , or technical skill , intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power . Other activities related to the production of works of art include the criticism of art , the study of the history of art , and the aesthetic dissemination [ clarification needed ] of art . The three classical branches of art are painting , sculpture and architecture . Music , theatre , film , dance , and other performing arts , as well as literature and other media such as interactive media , are included in a broader definition of the arts . Until the 17th century , art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences . In modern usage after the 17th century , where aesthetic considerations are paramount , the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general , such as the decorative or applied arts . Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed and has changed over time , general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from human agency and creation . The nature of art and related concepts , such as creativity and interpretation , are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics .",

BJP ) is one of the two major political parties in India , along with the Indian National Congress . As of 2019 [ update ] , it is the country 's largest political party in terms of representation in the national parliament and state assemblies and is the world 's largest party in terms of primary membership . BJP is a right-wing party , and its policy has historically reflected Hindu nationalist positions . It has close ideological and organisational links to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) . The BJP 's origin lies in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh , formed in 1951 by Syama Prasad Mukherjee . After the State of Emergency in 1977 , the Jana Sangh merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party ; it defeated the incumbent Congress party in the 1977 general election . After three years in power , the Janata party dissolved in 1980 with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the BJP . Although initially unsuccessful , winning only two seats in the 1984 general election , it grew in strength on the back of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement . Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections , the BJP became the largest party in the parliament in 1996 ; however , it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament , and its government lasted only 13 days . After the 1998 general election , the BJP-led coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee formed a government that lasted for a year . Following fresh elections , the NDA government , again headed by Vajpayee , lasted for a full term in office ; this was the first non-Congress government to do so .",

  "/wiki/Literature": "Literature , most generically , is any body of written works . More restrictively , literature refers to writing considered to be an art form or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value , often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage . Its Latin root literatura/litteratura ( derived itself from littera : letter or handwriting ) was used to refer to all written accounts . The concept has changed meaning over time to include texts that are spoken or sung ( oral literature ) , and non-written verbal art forms . Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works , culminating in electronic literature . Literature is classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction , and whether it is poetry or prose . It can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel , short story or drama ; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations ( genre ) .",

  "/wiki/Social_work": "Social work is an academic discipline and profession that concerns itself with individuals , families , groups , and communities in an effort to enhance social functioning and overall well-being . Social functioning is the way in which people perform their social roles , and the structural institutions that are provided [ by whom ? ] to sustain them . Social work applies social sciences , such as sociology , psychology , political science , public health , community development , law , and economics , to engage with client systems , conduct assessments , and develop interventions to solve social and personal problems ; and to bring about social change . Social work practice is often divided into micro-work , which involves working directly with individuals or small groups ; and macro-work , which involves working with communities , and - within social policy - fostering change on a larger scale . The social work industry developed in the 19th century , with some of its roots in voluntary philanthropy and in grassroots organizing . However , responses to social needs had existed long before then , primarily from private charities and from religious organizations . The effects of the Industrial Revolution and of the Great Depression of the 1930s placed pressure on social work to become a more defined discipline . [ need quotation to verify ]",

  "/wiki/Sport": "Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which , through casual or organised participation , at least in part aim to use , maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants , and in some cases , entertainment for spectators . Hundreds of sports exist , from those between single contestants , through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants , either in teams or competing as individuals . In certain sports such as racing , many contestants may compete , simultaneously or consecutively , with one winner ; in others , the contest ( a match ) is between two sides , each attempting to exceed the other . Some sports allow a tie or draw , in which there is no single winner ; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser . A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion . Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season , followed in some cases by playoffs . Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity , with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition , and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports . However , a number of competitive , but non-physical , activities claim recognition as mind sports . The International Olympic Committee ( through ARISF ) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports , and SportAccord , the international sports federation association , recognises five non-physical sports : bridge , chess , draughts ( checkers ) , Go and xiangqi , and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports . Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs , which serve to ensure fair competition , and allow consistent adjudication of the winner . Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first . It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance , including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression .",

  "/wiki/Journalism": "Journalism is the production and distribution of reports on events . The word journalism applies to the occupation , as well as citizen journalists who gather and publish information . Journalistic media include print , television , radio , Internet , and , in the past , newsreels . Concepts of the appropriate role for journalism vary between countries . In some nations , the news media are controlled by government intervention and are not fully independent . In others , the news media are independent of the government but instead operate as private industry motivated by profit . In addition to the varying nature of how media organizations are run and funded , countries may have differing implementations of laws handling the freedom of speech and libel cases . The proliferation of the Internet and smartphones has brought significant changes to the media landscape since the turn of the 21st century . This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels , as people increasingly consume news through e-readers , smartphones , and other personal electronic devices , as opposed to the more traditional formats of newspapers , magazines , or television news channels . News organizations are challenged to fully monetize their digital wing , as well as improvise on the context in which they publish in print . Newspapers have seen print revenues sink at a faster pace than the rate of growth for digital revenues .",

  "/wiki/Law": "Law is commonly understood as a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate conduct , although its precise definition is a matter of longstanding debate . It has been variously described as a science and the art of justice . State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator , resulting in statutes , by the executive through decrees and regulations , or established by judges through precedent , normally in common law jurisdictions . Private individuals can create legally binding contracts , including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process . The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution , written or tacit , and the rights encoded therein . The law shapes politics , economics , history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people . Legal systems vary between countries , with their differences analysed in comparative law . In civil law jurisdictions , a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates the law . In common law systems , judges make binding case law through precedent , although on occasion case law may be overturned by a higher court or the legislature . Historically , religious law influenced secular matters , and is still used in some religious communities . Sharia law based on Islamic principles is used as the primary legal system in several countries , including Iran and Saudi Arabia . Law 's scope can be divided into two domains ."
