Beef cured without nitrates or nitrites has a gray color , and is sometimes called New England corned beef . Corned beef was popular during both World Wars , when fresh meat was rationed .

  "/wiki/Marble_cake": "A marble cake is a cake with a streaked or mottled appearance ( like marble ) achieved by very lightly blending light and dark batter .

Early recipes used molasses and spices to achieve the dark-colored batter . The world 's largest marble cake was made for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver , for an episode on Turkmenistan 's authoritarian president Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow . It is a 600 sq/ft cake featuring an edible image of Berdimuhamedow falling off a horse , with a marble-textured frame and red trimmings . According to Oliver , Guinness World Records , which was criticized in the episode for its relations with authoritarian regimes , refused to certify the record unless the show signed a contract prohibiting it from criticizing the company .

  "/wiki/Shrimp": "Shrimp are decapod crustaceans with elongated bodies and a primarily swimming mode of locomotion - most commonly Caridea and Dendrobranchiata . More narrow definitions may be restricted to Caridea , to smaller species of either group or to only the marine species . Under a broader definition , shrimp may be synonymous with prawn , covering stalk-eyed swimming crustaceans with long narrow muscular tails ( abdomens ) , long whiskers ( antennae ) , and slender legs . Any small crustacean which resembles a shrimp tends to be called one . They swim forward by paddling with swimmerets on the underside of their abdomens , although their escape response is typically repeated flicks with the tail driving them backwards very quickly . Crabs and lobsters have strong walking legs , whereas shrimp have thin , fragile legs which they use primarily for perching . Shrimp are widespread and abundant . There are thousands of species adapted to a wide range of habitats . They can be found feeding near the seafloor on most coasts and estuaries , as well as in rivers and lakes . To escape predators , some species flip off the seafloor and dive into the sediment . They usually live from one to seven years . Shrimp are often solitary , though they can form large schools during the spawning season .",
