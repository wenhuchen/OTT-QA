  "/wiki/Industry_Classification_Benchmark": "The Industry Classification Benchmark ( ICB ) is an industry classification taxonomy launched by Dow Jones and FTSE in 2005 and now used by FTSE International and STOXX . It is used to segregate markets into sectors within the macroeconomy . The ICB uses a system of 10 industries , partitioned into 19 supersectors , which are further divided into 41 sectors , which then contain 114 subsectors . The ICB is used globally ( though not universally ) to divide the market into increasingly specific categories , allowing investors to compare industry trends between well-defined subsectors . The ICB replaced the legacy FTSE and Dow Jones classification systems on 3 January 2006 , and is used today by the NASDAQ , NYSE and several other markets around the globe . All ICB sectors are represented on the New York Stock Exchange except Equity Investment Instruments ( 8980 ) and Nonequity Investment Instruments ( 8990 ) . Dow Jones divested itself of its 50% interest in the ICB in 2011 and announced it was creating its own version of it .",

While telegraph traffic continued to rise in the following decade , the technology was soon to be replaced by the telephone . Switzerland 's entry into the telephone age came in 1877 , when the first experimental phone lines appeared , starting with a line linking the post office building with the Federal Palace and then with a link , using the existing telegraph line , between Bern and Thun .
