  "/wiki/Pentecostalism": "Pentecostalism or Classical Pentecostalism is a Protestant Christian movement that emphasises direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit . The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost , the Greek name for the Jewish Feast of Weeks . For Christians , this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ , as described in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles . Like other forms of evangelical Protestantism , Pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the Bible and the necessity of accepting Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior . It is distinguished by belief in the baptism in the Holy Spirit that enables a Christian to live a Spirit-filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing - two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement . Pentecostalism emerged in the early 20th century among radical adherents of the Holiness movement who were energized by revivalism and expectation for the imminent Second Coming of Christ . Believing that they were living in the end times , they expected God to spiritually renew the Christian Church thereby bringing to pass the restoration of spiritual gifts and the evangelization of the world . In 1900 , Charles Parham , an American evangelist and faith healer , began teaching that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism and along with William J. Seymour , a Wesleyan-Holiness preacher , he taught that this was the third work of grace . The three-year-long Azusa Street Revival , founded and led by Seymour in Los Angeles , California , resulted in the spread of Pentecostalism throughout the United States and the rest of the world as visitors carried the Pentecostal experience back to their home churches or felt called to the mission field .",

  "/wiki/Christian_fundamentalism": "Christian fundamentalism began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries among British and American Protestants as a reaction to theological liberalism and cultural modernism . Fundamentalists argued that 19th-century modernist theologians had misinterpreted or rejected certain doctrines , especially biblical inerrancy , which they considered the fundamentals of the Christian faith . Fundamentalists are almost always described as having a literal interpretation of the Bible . A few scholars label Catholics who reject modern theology in favor of more traditional doctrines fundamentalists . Scholars debate how much the terms evangelical and fundamentalist are synonymous . In keeping with traditional Christian doctrines concerning biblical interpretation , the role of Jesus in the Bible , and the role of the church in society , fundamentalists usually believe in a core of Christian beliefs which include the historical accuracy of the Bible and all of the events which are recorded in it as well as the Second Coming of Jesus Christ . Interpretations of Christian fundamentalism have changed over time . Fundamentalism as a movement manifested in various denominations with various theologies , rather than a single denomination or systematic theology . It became active in the 1910s after the release of The Fundamentals , a twelve-volume set of essays , apologetic and polemic , written by conservative Protestant theologians to defend what they saw as Protestant orthodoxy . The movement became more organized within U.S. Protestant churches in the 1920s , especially with Baptists and Presbyterians . Many churches which embraced fundamentalism adopted a militant attitude with regard to their core beliefs and combined Princeton theology with Dispensationalism . Since 1930 , many fundamentalist churches have been represented by the Independent Fundamental Churches of America ( renamed IFCA International in 1996 ) , which holds to biblical inerrancy .",
  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",

  "/wiki/Calvinism": "Calvinism ( also called the Reformed tradition , Reformed Christianity , Reformed Protestantism , or the Reformed faith ) is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice set down by John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians . Calvinists broke from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century . Calvinists differ from Lutherans on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist , theories of worship , and the use of God 's law for believers , among other things . The term Calvinism can be misleading , because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse , with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder ; however almost all of them drew heavily from the writings of Augustine of Hippo a millennium prior . In the context of the Reformation , Huldrych Zwingli began the Reformed tradition in 1519 in the city of Z\u00fcrich . His followers were instantly labeled Zwinglians , consistent with the Catholic practice of naming heresy after its founder . Very soon , Zwingli was joined by Martin Bucer , Wolfgang Capito , William Farel , Johannes Oecolampadius and other early Reformed thinkers . The namesake of the movement , French reformer John Calvin , renounced Roman Catholicism and embraced Protestant views in the late 1520s or early 1530s , as the earliest notions of later Reformed tradition were already espoused by Huldrych Zwingli . The movement was first called Calvinism , referring to John Calvin , by Lutherans who opposed it . Many within the tradition find it either an indescriptive or an inappropriate term and would prefer the word Reformed to be used instead . The most important Reformed theologians include Calvin , Zwingli , Martin Bucer , William Farel , Heinrich Bullinger , Peter Martyr Vermigli , Theodore Beza , and John Knox .

Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States . In 2016 , there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world , meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical . The United States has the largest concentration of evangelicals in the world . American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation 's population and its single largest religious group . The main movements are Baptist churches , Pentecostalism , charismatic Evangelicalism , neo-charismatic Evangelicalism and nondenominational Evangelicalism .",

  "/wiki/Mainline_(Protestant)": "The mainline Protestant churches ( also called mainstream Protestant and sometimes oldline Protestant ) are a group of Protestant denominations in the United States that contrast in history and practice with evangelical , fundamentalist , and charismatic Protestant denominations . Some make a distinction between mainline and oldline , with the former referring only to denominational ties and the latter referring to church lineage , prestige and influence . However , this distinction has largely been lost to history and the terms are now nearly synonymous . These terms are also increasingly used in other countries for the same purpose of distinguishing between the so-called oldline and neo-Protestants . [ citation needed ] Mainline Protestants were a majority of Protestants in the United States until the mid-20th century . A dip in membership across all Christian denominations was more pronounced among mainline groups , with the result that mainline groups no longer comprise the majority . Mainline churches include the so-called Seven Sisters of American Protestantism - the United Methodist Church , the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America , the Presbyterian Church ( USA ) , the Episcopal Church , the American Baptist Churches , the United Church of Christ , and the Disciples of Christ - as well as the Quakers , Reformed Church in America , African Methodist Episcopal church and other churches . The term 'mainline ' has also been applied to Canadian Protestant churches that share common origins with their US counterparts . In Mexico , the Anglican Church is historically tied to and formed from the US Episcopal Church . The term is also occasionally used to refer to historic Protestant churches in Europe , Latin America , and South Africa . Mainline churches share an active approach to social issues that often leads to cooperation in organizations such as the National Council of Churches . Because of their involvement with the ecumenical movement , mainline churches are sometimes ( especially outside the United States ) given the alternative label of ecumenical Protestantism .",
