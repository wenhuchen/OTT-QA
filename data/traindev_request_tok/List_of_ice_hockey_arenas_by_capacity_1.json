At its inception , the NHL had four teams - all in Canada , thus the adjective National in the league 's name . The league expanded to the United States in 1924 , when the Boston Bruins joined , and has since consisted of American and Canadian teams . From 1942 to 1967 , the league had only six teams , collectively ( if not contemporaneously ) nicknamed the Original Six . The NHL added six new teams to double its size at the 1967 NHL expansion .

Sixty-seven players jumped from the NHL to the WHA in the first year , led by star forward Bobby Hull , whose ten-year , $ 2.75 million contract was a record at the time . The WHA also took the initiative to sign European players . The WHA had an acrimonious relationship with the NHL , resulting in numerous legal battles , as well as competition for control of players and markets . In spite of this , merger talks began almost immediately , as the WHA was constantly unstable , with franchises occasionally relocating or folding in the middle of the season . NHL owners voted down a 1977 plan to merge six WHA teams ( the Edmonton Oilers , New England Whalers , Quebec Nordiques , Cincinnati Stingers , Houston Aeros , and Winnipeg Jets ) into the NHL before a 1979 merger was approved . As a result , the WHA ceased operations , and four teams joined the NHL for the 1979-80 season : the Edmonton Oilers , New England Whalers , Quebec Nordiques , and Winnipeg Jets . Of these four teams , two of the three Canadian teams - the Nordiques and Jets - eventually moved south to Denver and Phoenix , respectively , although the NHL would return to Winnipeg with the 2011 relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers , who would rename themselves the Winnipeg Jets upon their relocation .",
