  "/wiki/Twin_Peaks": "Twin Peaks is an American mystery horror drama television series created by Mark Frost and David Lynch that premiered on April 8 , 1990 , on ABC . Declining ratings led to its cancellation after its second season in 1991 . It nonetheless gained a devoted cult following and has been referenced in a wide variety of media . In subsequent years , Twin Peaks is often listed among the greatest television series of all time , and is considered a landmark turning point in television drama . The series follows an investigation headed by FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper ( Kyle MacLachlan ) and local Sheriff Harry S. Truman ( Michael Ontkean ) into the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer ( Sheryl Lee ) in the fictional rural town of Twin Peaks , Washington . The show 's narrative draws on elements of detective fiction , but its uncanny tone , supernatural elements , and campy , melodramatic portrayal of eccentric characters also draw on American soap opera and horror tropes . Like much of Lynch 's work , it is distinguished by surrealism , offbeat humor , and distinctive cinematography . The score was composed by Angelo Badalamenti with Lynch . The success of the show sparked a media franchise , and the series was followed by a 1992 feature film , Twin Peaks : Fire Walk with Me , that serves as a prequel to the series . Additional tie-in books were also released . Following a hiatus of over 25 years , the show returned in 2017 with a third season on Showtime , marketed as Twin Peaks : The Return and Twin Peaks : A Limited Event Series . The season was directed by Lynch and written by Lynch and Frost , and starred many original cast members , including MacLachlan .",
