  "/wiki/Wonder_Wart-Hog": "Wonder Wart-Hog ( the Hog of Steel ) is an underground comic book character , a porcine parody of Superman , created by Gilbert Shelton and first published in 1962 . Over the years , Shelton has worked on the strip in collaboration with various writers and artists , including Tony Bell , Bill Killeen and Joe E. Brown Jr . The humor of Wonder Wart-Hog works on many levels . Fundamentally , it is slap-stick comedy in which excessive force is a constant theme . But it also parodies the McCarthyism and violence of the far right . Wonder Wart-Hog is a pro-establishment , law and order type personality , often gone overboard . For example , he 's willing to kill a lady driver talking on her cell phone because she might cause an accident . In addition , his enemies are silly villains such as Super Fool , the Masked Meanie and his evil twin brother . The zany showdowns involve contests such as backward motorcycle races ( who can go the slowest ) or exposing some villain running a fraud scheme such as comet insurance . Wonder Wart-Hog dispatches his enemies in various ways , including dismemberment , grinding them into sausage , flinging them into orbit , or crushing them with his immense bulk . But on one occasion he punished a lynch mob by giving them Cadillacs and TV sets , and then banishing them to Mississippi . Gilbert 's humor occasionally crosses the line into violence of a sexual nature , but the emphasis is more on the absurdity of the situation than the act itself .",

  "/wiki/Porky_Pig": "Porky Pig is an animated character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power , and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character . Even after he was supplanted by later characters , Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and , more importantly , the Warners directors , who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles . He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts , Th-th-th-that 's all folks ! This slogan ( without stuttering ) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons . In contrast , the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan : So Long , Folks ! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series ( when Bugs Bunny was the closing character , he would break the pattern by simply saying , in his Brooklynese accent , And Dat 's De End ! ) . He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character . Porky 's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter , for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words ; for example , What 's going on ? might become What 's guh-guh-guh-guh - .what 's happening ? Porky 's age varied widely in the series ; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet ( explicitly mentioned as such in Porky 's Preview ) , Porky was more frequently cast as an adult , often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years . In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons , Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head , and his attempt to close the show with The End becomes Th-Th-The , Th-Th-The , Th-Th .",

He appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics , as well as in a number of movies , television shows , and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe . In the stories , Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker , an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash . Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues , and accompanied him with many supporting characters , such as J. Jonah Jameson , Harry Osborn , Max Modell , romantic interests Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson , and foes such as Doctor Octopus , Green Goblin and Venom . His origin story has him acquiring spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider ; these include clinging to surfaces , shooting spider-webs from wrist-mounted devices , and detecting danger with his spider-sense . When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s , teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist . The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker , a high school student from Queens behind Spider-Man 's secret identity and with whose self-obsessions with rejection , inadequacy , and loneliness young readers could relate . While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick , unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin , Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman ; he thus had to learn for himself that with great power there must also come great responsibility - a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian , the late Uncle Ben . Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series , the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man .
