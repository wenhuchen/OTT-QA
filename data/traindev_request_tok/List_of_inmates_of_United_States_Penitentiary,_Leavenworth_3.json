  "/wiki/Harlem": "Harlem is a neighborhood in the northern section of the New York City borough of Manhattan . It is bounded roughly by Frederick Douglass Boulevard , St. Nicholas Avenue , and Morningside Park on the west ; the Harlem River and 155th Street on the north ; Fifth Avenue on the east ; and Central Park North on the south . The greater Harlem area encompasses several other neighborhoods and extends west to the Hudson River , north to 155th Street , east to the East River , and south to 96th Street . Originally a Dutch village , formally organized in 1658 , it is named after the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands . Harlem 's history has been defined by a series of economic boom-and-bust cycles , with significant population shifts accompanying each cycle . Harlem was predominantly occupied by Jewish and Italian Americans in the 19th century , but African-American residents began to arrive in large numbers during the Great Migration in the 20th century . In the 1920s and 1930s , Central and West Harlem were the focus of the Harlem Renaissance , a major African-American cultural movement . With job losses during the Great Depression of the 1930s and the deindustrialization of New York City after World War II , rates of crime and poverty increased significantly . In the 21st century , crime rates decreased significantly , and Harlem started to gentrify . Harlem is part of Manhattan Community District 10 . It is patrolled by the 28th and 32nd Precincts of the New York City Police Department . The greater Harlem area also includes Manhattan Community Districts 9 and 11 , and several additional police precincts .",
  "/wiki/Organized_crime": "Organized crime is a category of transnational , national , or local groupings of highly centralized enterprises run by criminals to engage in illegal activity , most commonly for profit . Some criminal organizations , such as terrorist groups , are politically motivated . Sometimes criminal organizations force people to do business with them , such as when a gang extorts money from shopkeepers for protection . Gangs may become disciplined enough to be considered organized . A criminal organization or gang can also be referred to as a mafia , mob , ring , or syndicate ; the network , subculture and community of criminals may be referred to as the underworld . European sociologists ( e.g . Diego Gambetta ) define the mafia as a type of organized crime group that specializes in the supply of extra-legal protection and quasi law enforcement . Gambetta 's classic work on the Sicilian mafia generates an economic study of the mafia , which exerts great influence on studies of the Russian mafia , the Chinese triads , Hong Kong mafia and the Japanese yakuza . Other organizations - including states , churches , militarist , police forces , and corporations - may sometimes use organized-crime methods to conduct their activities , but their powers derive from their status as formal social institutions . There is a tendency to distinguish organized crime from other forms of crime , such as white-collar crime , financial crimes , political crimes , war crime , state crimes , and treason . This distinction is not always apparent and academics continue to debate the matter . For example , in failed states that can no longer perform basic functions such as education , security , or governance ( usually due to fractious violence or to extreme poverty ) , organized crime , governance and war sometimes complement each other .",

  "/wiki/Drug_possession": "Drug possession is the crime of having one or more illegal drugs in one 's possession , either for personal use , distribution , sale or otherwise . Illegal drugs fall into different categories and sentences vary depending on the amount , type of drug , circumstances , and jurisdiction . A person has possession of drugs if they have actual physical control of the drugs ( they have the drugs in their hands ) or if the drugs are on that person . A person also has possession of drugs if they have the power and intent to control their disposition and use . In the United States , the penalty for illegal drug possession and sale can vary from a small fine to a prison sentence . In some states , marijuana possession is considered to be a petty offense , with the penalty being comparable to that of a speeding violation . [ disputed - discuss ] Generally , however , drug possession is an arrestable offense , with repercussions including large fines and possible incarceration or probation . In Singapore , 70% of executions are for drug-related offenses , which encompasses drug possession . There is a national drug control law known as the Misuse of Drugs Act used to assess and determine drug trafficking . Drug possession can account for imprisonment , caning and capital punishment , based on the amount of controlled drugs a person possesses .",

Federal prosecutors indicted him for nineteen murders based on the grand jury testimony from Kevin Weeks and other former associates . Bulger was the brother of William Bulger , former President of the Massachusetts Senate . However adamantly denied by Bulger , the FBI admitted that he served as an informant for several years starting in 1975 . He provided information about the inner workings of the Patriarca crime family of Providence , the Italian-American crime group who were his rivals . In return , his corrupt and high-powered FBI handler ensured that his own crime group effectively went ignored . Beginning in 1997 , the news media exposed various criminal misconduct by officials tied to Bulger from federal , state , and local law enforcement . This caused great embarrassment to each of these agencies , but none more so than the FBI . On December 23 , 1994 , Bulger fled the Boston area and went into hiding after his former FBI handler , John Connolly , tipped him off about a pending RICO indictment against him . Bulger remained at large for 16 years . Bulger was finally apprehended along with his longtime girlfriend Catherine Greig outside an apartment complex in Santa Monica , California on June 22 , 2011 .

They were most influential from 1965 under the rule of McLean and Winter until the takeover led by Bulger in 1979 . The Winter Hill Gang was given its name in the 1970s by journalists at the Boston Herald , although the name was hardly ever openly used as a reference to them . While Winter Hill Gang members are alleged to have been involved with most typical organized-crime-related activities , they are perhaps most known for fixing horse races in the northeastern United States and shipping weapons to the IRA . Twenty-one members and associates , including Winter , were indicted by federal prosecutors in 1979 .",
  "/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act": "The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) Act is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization . The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering and allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they ordered others to do or assisted them in doing , closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to , for example , murder , to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally . RICO was enacted by section 901 ( a ) of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 ( Pub.L . 91-452 , 84 Stat . 922 , enacted October 15 , 1970 ) and is codified at 18 U.S.C . ch . 96 as 18 U.S.C . \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 . G. Robert Blakey , an adviser to the United States Senate Government Operations Committee , drafted the law under the close supervision of the committee 's chairman , Senator John Little McClellan . It was enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 , and signed into law by Richard M. Nixon . While its original use in the 1970s was to prosecute the Mafia as well as others who were actively engaged in organized crime , its later application has been more widespread . Beginning in 1972 , 33 states adopted state RICO laws to be able to prosecute similar conduct .",
  "/wiki/Extortion": "Extortion ( also called shakedown , and , in a legal sense incorrectly , exaction ) is obtaining benefit through coercion . In most jurisdictions it is likely to constitute a criminal offense ; the bulk of this article deals with such cases . Extortion is sometimes called the protection racket since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for protection from ( real or hypothetical ) threats from unspecified other parties ; though often , and almost always , such protection is simply abstinence of harm from the same party , and such is implied in the protection offer . Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime . In some jurisdictions , actually obtaining the benefit is not required to commit the offense , and making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense . Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force , but additionally , in its formal definition , means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant . The term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to price-gouging , though neither is legally considered extortion . It is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against their will , to another , in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences . Neither extortion nor blackmail requires a threat of a criminal act , such as violence , merely a threat used to elicit actions , money , or property from the object of the extortion . Such threats include the filing of reports ( true or not ) of criminal behavior to the police , revelation of damaging facts ( such as pictures of the object of the extortion in a compromising position ) , etc . In law extortion can refer to political corruption , such as selling one 's office or influence peddling , [ citation needed ] but in general vocabulary the word usually first brings to mind blackmail or protection rackets . The logical connection between the corruption sense of the word and the other senses is that to demand bribes in one 's official capacity is blackmail or racketeering in essence ( that is , you need access to this resource , the government restricts access to it through my office , and I will charge you unfairly and unlawfully for such access ) .",
  "/wiki/Drug_trafficking": "The illegal drug trade or drug trafficking is a global black market dedicated to the cultivation , manufacture , distribution and sale of drugs that are subject to drug prohibition laws . Most jurisdictions prohibit trade , except under license , of many types of drugs through the use of drug prohibition laws . The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 's World Drug Report 2005 estimates the size of the global illicit drug market at US $ 321.6 billion in 2003 alone . With a world GDP of US $ 36 trillion in the same year , the illegal drug trade may be estimated as nearly 1% of total global trade . Consumption of illegal drugs is widespread globally and it remains very difficult for local authorities to thwart its popularity .",
  "/wiki/Money_laundering": "Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions . The overall scheme of this process returns the money to the launderer in an obscure and indirect way . One problem of criminal activities is accounting for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies . Considerable time and effort may be put into strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion . Implementing such strategies is generally called money laundering . After money has been laundered , it can be used for legitimate purposes . Law enforcement agencies of many jurisdictions have set up sophisticated systems in an effort to detect suspicious transactions or activities , and many have set up international cooperative arrangements to assist each other in these endeavors . The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) estimates that The estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2-5% of global GDP , or $ 800 billion - $ 2 trillion in current US dollars . In a number of legal and regulatory systems , the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime , and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system ( involving things such as securities , digital currencies , credit cards , and traditional currency ) , including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions . Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering ( which is concerned with source of funds ) with terrorism financing ( which is concerned with destination of funds ) when regulating the financial system . Some countries treat obfuscation of sources of money as also constituting money laundering , whether it is intentional or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations . Other countries define money laundering in such a way as to include money from activity that would have been a crime in that country , even if the activity was legal where the actual conduct occurred .",

  "/wiki/Rum-running": "Rum-running , or bootlegging , is the illegal business of transporting ( smuggling ) alcoholic beverages where such transportation is forbidden by law . Smuggling usually takes place to circumvent taxation or prohibition laws within a particular jurisdiction . The term rum-running is more commonly applied to smuggling over water ; bootlegging is applied to smuggling over land . It is believed that the term bootlegging originated during the American Civil War , when soldiers would sneak liquor into army camps by concealing pint bottles within their boots or beneath their trouser legs . Also , according to the PBS documentary Prohibition , the term bootlegging was popularized when thousands of city dwellers sold liquor from flasks they kept in their boot legs all across major cities and rural areas . The term rum-running most likely originated at the start of Prohibition in the United States ( 1920-1933 ) , when ships from Bimini in the western Bahamas transported cheap Caribbean rum to Florida speakeasies . But rum 's cheapness made it a low-profit item for the rum-runners , and they soon moved on to smuggling Canadian whisky , French champagne , and English gin to major cities like New York City , Boston , and Chicago , where prices ran high . It was said [ by whom ? ] that some ships carried $ 200,000 in contraband in a single run .",
  "/wiki/Armed_robbery": "Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force , threat of force , or by putting the victim in fear . According to common law , robbery is defined as taking the property of another , with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property , by means of force or fear ; that is , it is a larceny or theft accomplished by an assault . Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions . Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft ( such as burglary , shoplifting , pickpocketing , or car theft ) by its inherently violent nature ( a violent crime ) ; whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors , robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two . Under English law , most forms of theft are triable either way , whereas robbery is triable only on indictment . The word rob came via French from Late Latin words ( e.g. , deraubare ) of Germanic origin , from Common Germanic raub theft . Among the types of robbery are armed robbery , which involves the use of a weapon , and aggravated robbery , when someone brings with them a deadly weapon or something that appears to be a deadly weapon . Highway robbery or mugging takes place outside or in a public place such as a sidewalk , street , or parking lot . Carjacking is the act of stealing a car from a victim by force . Extortion is the threat to do something illegal , or the offer to not do something illegal , in the event that goods are not given , primarily using words instead of actions . Criminal slang for robbery includes blagging ( armed robbery , usually of a bank ) or stick-up ( derived from the verbal command to robbery targets to raise their hands in the air ) , and steaming ( organized robbery on underground train systems ) .",
  "/wiki/Kidnapping": "In criminal law , kidnapping is the unlawful transportation , asportation and confinement of a person against their will . Thus , it is a composite crime . It can also be defined as false imprisonment by means of abduction , both of which are separate crimes that when committed simultaneously upon the same person merge as the single crime of kidnapping . The asportation/abduction element is typically but not necessarily conducted by means of force or fear . That is , the perpetrator may use a weapon to force the victim into a vehicle , but it is still kidnapping if the victim is enticed to enter the vehicle willingly , e.g. , in the belief it is a taxicab . Kidnapping may be done to demand for ransom in exchange for releasing the victim , or for other illegal purposes . Kidnapping can be accompanied by bodily injury which elevates the crime to aggravated kidnapping . Kidnapping of a child is also known as child abduction , and these are sometimes separate legal categories .",

His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he went to prison at age 33 . Capone was born in New York City in 1899 to Italian immigrant parents . He joined the Five Points Gang as a teenager , and became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels . In his early twenties , he moved to Chicago and became a bodyguard and trusted factotum for Johnny Torrio , head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol - the forerunner of the Outfit - and was politically protected through the Unione Siciliana . A conflict with the North Side Gang was instrumental in Capone 's rise and fall . Torrio went into retirement after North Side gunmen almost killed him , handing control to Capone . Capone expanded the bootlegging business through increasingly violent means , but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor William Hale Thompson and the city 's police meant he seemed safe from law enforcement . Capone apparently reveled in attention , such as the cheers from spectators when he appeared at ball games . He made donations to various charities and was viewed by many as modern-day Robin Hood . However , the Saint Valentine 's Day Massacre , in which seven gang rivals were murdered in broad daylight , damaged Chicago 's and Capone 's image , leading influential citizens to demand government action and newspapers to dub Capone Public Enemy No . 1 .",

  "/wiki/Tax_evasion": "Tax evasion is the illegal evasion of taxes by individuals , corporations , and trusts . Tax evasion often entails taxpayers deliberately misrepresenting the true state of their affairs to the tax authorities to reduce their tax liability and includes dishonest tax reporting , such as declaring less income , profits or gains than the amounts actually earned , or overstating deductions . Tax evasion is an activity commonly associated with the informal economy . One measure of the extent of tax evasion ( the tax gap ) is the amount of unreported income , which is the difference between the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authorities and the actual amount reported . In contrast , tax avoidance is the legal use of tax laws to reduce one 's tax burden . Both tax evasion and avoidance can be viewed as forms of tax noncompliance , as they describe a range of activities that intend to subvert a state 's tax system , although such classification of tax avoidance is not indisputable , given that avoidance is lawful , within self-creating systems .",
  "/wiki/Gambling": "Gambling ( also known as betting ) is the wagering of money or something of value ( referred to as the stakes ) on an event with an uncertain outcome , with the primary intent of winning money or material goods . Gambling thus requires three elements to be present : consideration ( an amount wagered ) , risk ( chance ) , and a prize . The outcome of the wager is often immediate , such as a single roll of dice , a spin of a roulette wheel , or a horse crossing the finish line , but longer time frames are also common , allowing wagers on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season . The term gaming in this context typically refers to instances in which the activity has been specifically permitted by law . The two words are not mutually exclusive ; i.e. , a gaming company offers ( legal ) gambling activities to the public and may be regulated by one of many gaming control boards , for example , the Nevada Gaming Control Board . However , this distinction is not universally observed in the English-speaking world . For instance , in the United Kingdom , the regulator of gambling activities is called the Gambling Commission ( not the Gaming Commission ) . The word gaming is used more frequently since the rise of computer and video games to describe activities that do not necessarily involve wagering , especially online gaming , with the new usage still not having displaced the old usage as the primary definition in common dictionaries . Gaming has also been used to circumvent laws against gambling . The media and others have used one term or the other to frame conversations around the subjects , resulting in a shift of perceptions among their audiences . Gambling is also a major international commercial activity , with the legal gambling market totaling an estimated $ 335 billion in 2009 .

  "/wiki/Cowboy": "A cowboy is an animal herder who tends cattle on ranches in North America , traditionally on horseback , and often performs a multitude of other ranch-related tasks . The historic American cowboy of the late 19th century arose from the vaquero traditions of northern Mexico and became a figure of special significance and legend . A subtype , called a wrangler , specifically tends the horses used to work cattle . In addition to ranch work , some cowboys work for or participate in rodeos . Cowgirls , first defined as such in the late 19th century , had a less-well documented historical role , but in the modern world work at identical tasks and have obtained considerable respect for their achievements . Cattle handlers in many other parts of the world , particularly South America and Australia , perform work similar to the cowboy . The cowboy has deep historic roots tracing back to Spain and the earliest European settlers of the Americas . Over the centuries , differences in terrain and climate , and the influence of cattle-handling traditions from multiple cultures , created several distinct styles of equipment , clothing and animal handling .

  "/wiki/American_Mafia": "The American Mafia , commonly referred to as the Mafia or sometimes the Mob , and the Italian-American Mafia , is a highly organized Italian-American criminal society . The organization is often referred to by its members as Cosa Nostra ( Italian pronunciation : [ \u02c8k\u0254\u02d0za \u02c8n\u0254stra , \u02c8k\u0254\u02d0sa - ] , our thing ) and by the government as La Cosa Nostra ( LCN ) . The organization 's name is derived from the original Mafia or Cosa nostra , the Sicilian Mafia , with American Mafia originally referring simply to Mafia groups from Sicily operating in America , as the organization originally emerged as an off shoot of the Sicilian Mafia ; however , the organization eventually encompassed or absorbed other Italian-American gangsters and Italian crime groups ( such as the American Camorra ) living in the United States and Canada that were not of Sicilian origin . It is often colloquially referred to as the Italian Mafia or Italian Mob , though these terms may also apply to the separate yet related Sicilian Mafia or other organized crime groups in Italy . The Mafia in the United States emerged in impoverished Italian immigrant neighborhoods or ghettos in New York 's East Harlem ( or Italian Harlem ) , the Lower East Side , and Brooklyn . It also emerged in other areas of the East Coast of the United States and several other major metropolitan areas ( such as New Orleans and Chicago ) during the late 19th century and early 20th century , following waves of Italian immigration especially from Sicily and other regions of Southern Italy . It has its roots in the Sicilian Mafia but is a separate organization in the United States . Neapolitan , Calabrian , and other Italian criminal groups in the U.S. , as well as independent Italian-American criminals , eventually merged with Sicilian Mafiosi to create the modern pan-Italian Mafia in North America . Today , the American Mafia cooperates in various criminal activities with Italian organized crime groups , such as the Sicilian Mafia , the Camorra of Naples , and the 'Ndrangheta of Calabria . The most important unit of the American Mafia is that of a family , as the various criminal organizations that make up the Mafia are known . Despite the name of family to describe the various units , they are not familial groupings . The Mafia is currently most active in the northeastern United States , with the heaviest activity in New York City , and with a substantial presence in Philadelphia , New Jersey , Buffalo and New England , in areas such as Boston , Providence and Hartford .",
  "/wiki/Underboss": "Underboss ( Italian : sottocapo ) is a position within the leadership structure of certain organized crime groups , particularly in Sicilian , Greek , and Italian-American Mafia crime families . The underboss is second in command to the boss . The underboss is sometimes a family member , such as a son , who will take over the family if the boss is sick , killed , or imprisoned . However the position of street boss has somewhat challenged the rank of underboss in the modern era . The position was installed within the Genovese crime family since at least the mid 1960s . It has also been used in the Detroit crime family and the Chicago Outfit . The power of an underboss greatly varies ; some are marginal figures , while others are the most powerful individuals in the family . Traditionally they run day-to-day affairs of the family . In some crime families , the appointment is for life . If a new boss takes over a family with an existing underboss , that boss may marginalize or even murder the underboss appointed by his predecessor . On the other hand , if a boss is incarcerated , the underboss may become acting boss . As bosses often serve large periods of time in prison , an acting boss will often become the crime family 's effective boss .",
  "/wiki/Colombo_Crime_Family": "The Colombo crime family ( pronounced [ ko\u02c8lombo ] ) is the youngest of the Five Families that dominates organized crime activities in New York City , United States , within the nationwide criminal organization known as the American Mafia . It was during Lucky Luciano 's organization of the American Mafia after the Castellammarese War , and the assassinations of Giuseppe Joe The Boss Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano , that the gang run by Joseph Profaci was recognized as the Profaci crime family . The family traces its roots to a bootlegging gang formed by Joseph Profaci in 1928 . Profaci would rule his family without interruption or challenge until the late 1950s . The family has been torn by three internal wars . The first war took place during the late 1950s when capo Joe Gallo revolted against Profaci , but it lost momentum in the early 1960s when Gallo was arrested and Profaci died of cancer . The family was not reunited until the early 1960s under Joseph Colombo . In 1971 , the second family war began after Gallo 's release from prison and the shooting of Colombo . Colombo supporters led by Carmine Persico won the second war after the exiling of the remaining Gallo crew to the Genovese family in 1975 . The family would then enjoy over 15 years of peace under Persico and his string of acting bosses .

  "/wiki/Racketeering": "A racket , according to the current common and most general definition , is an organized criminal act in which the criminal act is some form of substantial business , or a way to earn illegal money either regularly , or briefly but repeatedly . A racket is therefore generally a repeated or continuous organized criminal operation . However , according to the more specific definition , racketeering constitutes extortion or criminal coercion . Originally and often still specifically , a racket referred to a criminal act in which the perpetrator or perpetrators fraudulently offer a service that will not be put into effect , a service to solve a nonexistent problem , or to solve a problem that would not exist without the racket . Conducting a racket is racketeering . Particularly , the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it , but that fact may be concealed , with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party . The most common example of a racket is the protection racket , which promises to protect the target business or person from dangerous individuals in the neighborhood and then either collects the money or causes damage to the business until the owner pays . The racket exists as both the problem and its solution , and it is used as a method of extortion . However , the term racket has expanded in definition and may now be used less strictly to refer to any continuous or repeated illegal organized crime operation , including those that do not necessarily involve fraudulent practices . For example , racket may be used to refer to the numbers racket or the drug racket , neither of which generally involve fraud or deception with regard to the intended clientele . Racketeering is most often associated with organized crime , and the term was coined by the Employers ' Association of Chicago in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the Teamsters union .",

  "/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)": "In criminal law , a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime at some time in the future . Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement , to constitute an offense . There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and , in most countries , no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect ( compare attempts which require proximity to the full offense ) . For the purposes of concurrence , the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or can not be traced . Finally , repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability ( unless , in some cases , it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts ) but may reduce their sentence . An unindicted co-conspirator , or unindicted conspirator , is a person or entity that is alleged in an indictment to have engaged in conspiracy , but who is not charged in the same indictment . Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity , pragmatic considerations , and evidentiary concerns .",
