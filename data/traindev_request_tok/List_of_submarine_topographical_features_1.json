  "/wiki/Meter": "The metre ( Commonwealth spelling and BIPM spelling ) or meter ( American spelling ) ( from the French unit m\u00e8tre , from the Greek noun \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd , measure ) is the base unit of length in the International System of Units ( SI ) . The SI unit symbol is m. The metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second . The metre was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a great circle , so the Earth 's circumference is approximately 40,000 km . In 1799 , the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar ( the actual bar used was changed in 1889 ) . In 1960 , the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86 . In 1983 , the current definition was adopted .",
  "/wiki/Foot_(length)": "The foot ( pl . feet ; abbreviation : ft ; symbol : \u2032 , the prime symbol ) is a unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems of measurement . Since the International Yard and Pound Agreement of 1959 , one foot is defined as 0.3048 meter exactly . In customary and imperial units , the foot comprises 12 inches and three feet compose a yard . Historically the foot was a part of many local systems of units , including the Greek , Roman , Chinese , French , and English systems . It varied in length from country to country , from city to city , and sometimes from trade to trade . Its length was usually between 250 mm and 335 mm and was generally , but not always , subdivided into 12 inches or 16 digits . The United States is the only industrialized nation that uses the international foot and the survey foot ( a customary unit of length ) in preference to the meter in its commercial , engineering , and standards activities . The foot is legally recognized in the United Kingdom ; road signs must use imperial units ( however , distances on road signs are always marked in miles or yards , not feet ) , while its usage is widespread among the British public as a measurement of height . The foot is recognized as an alternative expression of length in Canada officially defined as a unit derived from the meter although both the U.K. and Canada have partially metricated their units of measurement . The measurement of altitude in international aviation is one of the few areas where the foot is used outside the English-speaking world . The length of the international foot corresponds to a human foot with shoe size of 13 ( UK ) , 14 ( US male ) , 15.5 ( US female ) or 47 ( EU sizing ) .",
  "/wiki/Mile": "The mile is an English unit of length of linear measure equal to 5,280 feet , or 1,760 yards , and standardised as exactly 1,609.344 metres by international agreement in 1959 . With qualifiers , mile is also used to describe or translate a wide range of units derived from or roughly equivalent to the Roman mile , such as the nautical mile ( now 1.852 km exactly ) , the Italian mile ( roughly 1.852 km ) , and the Chinese mile ( now 500 m exactly ) . The Romans divided their mile into 5,000 Roman feet but the greater importance of furlongs in pre-modern England meant that the statute mile was made equivalent to 8 furlongs or 5,280 feet in 1593 . This form of the mile then spread to the British-colonized nations some of which continue to employ the mile . The US Geological Survey now employs the metre for official purposes but legacy data from its 1927 geodetic datum has meant that a separate US survey mile ( 6336/3937 km ) continues to see some use . While most countries replaced the mile with the kilometre when switching to the International System of Units , the international mile continues to be used in some countries , such as Liberia , the United Kingdom , the United States , and a number of countries with fewer than one million inhabitants , most of which are UK or US territories , or have close historical ties with the UK or US . The mile was usually abbreviated m. in the past but is now sometimes written as mi to avoid confusion with the SI metre . However , derived units , such as miles per hour or miles per gallon , continue to be universally abbreviated as mph and mpg , respectively .",
  "/wiki/Challenger_Deep": "The Challenger Deep is the deepest known point in the Earth 's seabed hydrosphere ( the oceans ) , with a depth of 10,902 to 10,929 m ( 35,768 to 35,856 ft ) by direct measurement from deep-diving submersibles , remotely operated vehicles and benthic landers and ( sometimes ) slightly more by sonar bathymetry . The Challenger Deep is located in the Western Pacific Ocean , at the southern end of the Mariana Trench near the Mariana Islands group . According to the August 2011 version of the GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names , the Challenger Deep is 10,920 m ( 35,827 ft ) \u00b110 m ( 33 ft ) deep at 11\u00b022.4\u2032N 142\u00b035.5\u2032E / 11.3733\u00b0N 142.5917\u00b0E / 11.3733 ; 142.5917 . This location is in the ocean territory of the Federated States of Micronesia . The depression is named after the British Royal Navy survey ship HMS Challenger , whose expedition of 1872-1876 made the first recordings of its depth . The high water pressure at this depth makes designing and operating exploratory craft difficult . The first descent by any vehicle was by the manned bathyscaphe Trieste in January 1960 ; unmanned visits followed in 1996 , 1998 and 2009 . In March 2012 a manned solo descent was made by film director James Cameron in the deep-submergence vehicle Deepsea Challenger . Between 28 April and 4 May 2019 , the DSV Limiting Factor completed four manned dives to the bottom of Challenger Deep .",
  "/wiki/Izu-Bonin-Mariana_Arc": "The Izu-Bonin-Mariana ( IBM ) arc system is a tectonic-plate convergent boundary . The IBM arc system extends over 2800 km south from Tokyo , Japan , to beyond Guam , and includes the Izu Islands , Bonin Islands , and Mariana Islands ; much more of the IBM arc system is submerged below sealevel . The IBM arc system lies along the eastern margin of the Philippine Sea Plate in the Western Pacific Ocean . It is the site of the deepest gash in Earth 's solid surface , the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench . The IBM arc system formed as a result of subduction of the western Pacific plate . The IBM arc system now subducts mid-Jurassic to Early Cretaceous lithosphere , with younger lithosphere in the north and older lithosphere in the south , including the oldest ( ~170 million years old , or Ma ) oceanic crust . Subduction rates vary from ~2 cm ( 1 inch ) per year in the south to 6 cm ( ~2.5 inches ) in the north . The volcanic islands that comprise these island arcs are thought to have been formed from the release of volatiles ( steam from trapped water , and other gases ) being released from the subducted plate , as it reached sufficient depth for the temperature to cause release of these materials . The associated trenches are formed as the oldest ( most western ) part of the Pacific plate crust increases in density with age , and because of this process finally reaches its lowest point just as it subducts under the crust to the west of it . The IBM arc system is an excellent example of an intra-oceanic convergent margin ( IOCM ) . IOCMs are built on oceanic crust and contrast fundamentally with island arcs built on continental crust , such as Japan or the Andes . Because IOCM crust is thinner , denser , and more refractory than that beneath Andean-type margins , study of IOCM melts and fluids allows more confident assessment of mantle-to-crust fluxes and processes than is possible for Andean-type convergent margins .",
  "/wiki/Mariana_Trench": "The Mariana Trench or Marianas Trench is located in the western Pacific Ocean about 200 kilometres ( 124 mi ) east of the Mariana Islands ; it is the deepest trench in the world . It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km ( 1,580 mi ) in length and 69 km ( 43 mi ) in width . The maximum known depth is 10,984 metres ( 36,037 ft ) ( \u00b1 25 metres [ 82 ft ] ) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep . However , some unrepeated measurements place the deepest portion at 11,034 metres ( 36,201 ft ) . By comparison : if Mount Everest were placed into the trench at this point , its peak would still be over two kilometres ( 1.2 mi ) under water . [ a ] At the bottom of the trench the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bars ( 15,750 psi ) , more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level . At this pressure , the density of water is increased by 4.96% . The temperature at the bottom is 1 to 4 \u00b0C ( 34 to 39 \u00b0F ) . The trench is not the part of the seafloor closest to the center of the Earth . This is because the Earth is an oblate spheroid , not a perfect sphere ; its radius is about 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) smaller at the poles than at the equator . As a result , parts of the Arctic Ocean seabed are at least 13 kilometres ( 8.1 mi ) closer to the Earth 's center than the Challenger Deep seafloor . [ citation needed ] In 2009 , the Marianas Trench was established as a United States National Monument .",

At 165,250,000 square kilometers ( 63,800,000 square miles ) in area ( as defined with an Antarctic southern border ) , this largest division of the World Ocean - and , in turn , the hydrosphere - covers about 46% of Earth 's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area , making it larger than all of Earth 's land area combined . The centers of both the Water Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere are in the Pacific Ocean . The equator subdivides it into the North ( ern ) Pacific Ocean and South ( ern ) Pacific Ocean , with two exceptions : the Gal\u00e1pagos and Gilbert Islands , while straddling the equator , are deemed wholly within the South Pacific .

This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast .",
  "/wiki/Banda_Sea": "The Banda Sea is a sea in the Maluku Islands of Indonesia , connected to the Pacific Ocean but surrounded by hundreds of islands , as well as the Halmahera and Ceram Seas . It is about 1000 km ( 600 mi ) east to west , and about 500 km ( 300 mi ) north to south .",
  "/wiki/Middle_America_Trench": "The Middle America Trench is a major subduction zone , an oceanic trench in the eastern Pacific Ocean off the southwestern coast of Middle America , stretching from central Mexico to Costa Rica . The trench is 1,700 miles ( 2,750 km ) long and is 21,880 feet ( 6,669 m ) at its deepest point . The trench is the boundary between the Rivera , Cocos , and Nazca plates on one side and the North American and Caribbean plates on the other . It is the 18th-deepest trench in the world . Many large earthquakes have occurred in the area of the Middle America Trench .",
  "/wiki/Puysegur_Trench": "The 6,300-metre ( 20,700 ft ) deep Puysegur Trench is a deep cleft in the floor of the south Tasman Sea formed by the subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate under the Pacific Plate to the south of New Zealand . Immediately to its east lies a ridge , a northern extension of the Macquarie Ridge , which separates the Puysegur Trench from the Solander Trough . To the west is the expanse of the Tasman Basin , which stretches most of the distance to Australia . To the north of the trench lies the Fiordland Basin , which can be considered an extension of the trench . The Puysegur Trench mirrors the Kermadec Trench and Tonga Trench north of New Zealand . The Puysegur Trench stretches for over 800 kilometres south from the southwesternmost point of the South Island 's coast , its southernmost extent being 400 kilometres due west of the Auckland Islands . It is named after Puysegur Point ."
