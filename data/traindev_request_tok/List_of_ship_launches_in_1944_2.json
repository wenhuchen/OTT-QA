[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

The company was originally a major producer of magnesium during World War II and derives its name from the Permanente Creek in Santa Clara County , California where mining operations commenced in the early 1930s . To make use of its major product , powdered magnesium , PMC also developed and supplied an incendiary bomb mixture of magnesium powder , asphalt , gasoline and others components ( known as goop , with similar characteristics to napalm ) ; 17,000 short tons of goop-filled bombs were used in World War II ( approximately eight percent of the total tonnage of incendiaries that were dropped during that conflict ) .

  "/wiki/Liberty_ship": "Liberty ships were a class of cargo ship built in the United States during World War II . Though British in concept , the design was adapted by the United States for its simple , low-cost construction . Mass-produced on an unprecedented scale , the Liberty ship came to symbolize U.S. wartime industrial output . The class was developed to meet British orders for transports to replace ships that had been lost . Eighteen American shipyards built 2,710 Liberty ships between 1941 and 1945 ( an average of three ships every two days ) , easily the largest number of ships ever produced to a single design . Their production mirrored ( albeit on a much larger scale ) the manufacture of Hog Islander and similar standardized ship types during World War I . The immensity of the effort , the number of ships built , the role of female workers in their construction , and the survival of some far longer than their original five-year design life combine to make them the subject of much continued interest .",

After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation .

  "/wiki/Icebreaker": "An icebreaker is a special-purpose ship or boat designed to move and navigate through ice-covered waters , and provide safe waterways for other boats and ships . Although the term usually refers to ice-breaking ships , it may also refer to smaller vessels , such as the icebreaking boats that were once used on the canals of the United Kingdom . For a ship to be considered an icebreaker , it requires three traits most normal ships lack : a strengthened hull , an ice-clearing shape , and the power to push through sea ice . Icebreakers clear paths by pushing straight into frozen-over water or pack ice . The bending strength of sea ice is low enough that the ice breaks usually without noticeable change in the vessel 's trim . In cases of very thick ice , an icebreaker can drive its bow onto the ice to break it under the weight of the ship . A buildup of broken ice in front of a ship can slow it down much more than the breaking of the ice itself , so icebreakers have a specially designed hull to direct the broken ice around or under the vessel . The external components of the ship 's propulsion system ( propellers , propeller shafts , etc . ) are at greater risk of damage than the vessel 's hull , so the ability of an icebreaker to propel itself onto the ice , break it , and clear the debris from its path successfully is essential for its safety .",
