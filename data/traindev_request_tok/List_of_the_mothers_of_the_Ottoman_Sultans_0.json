It makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey . The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west . The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Europe . The eastern border of Anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea , bounded by the Armenian Highland to the east and Mesopotamia to the southeast . Thus , traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey . Today , Anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be Turkey 's eastern border . By some definitions , the Armenian Highlands lies beyond the boundary of the Anatolian plateau . The official name of this inland region is the Eastern Anatolia Region . The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic , Roman and Byzantine periods . Major Anatolian languages included Hittite , Luwian , and Lydian , among other more poorly attested relatives . The Turkification of Anatolia began under the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and continued under the Ottoman Empire between the late 13th and early 20th centuries .",

They were the main inhabitants of the lands of the Byzantine Empire ( Eastern Roman Empire ) , of Constantinople and Asia Minor ( modern Turkey ) , the Greek islands , Cyprus , and portions of the southern Balkans , and formed large minorities , or pluralities , in the coastal urban centres of the Levant and northern Egypt . Throughout their history , the Byzantine Greeks self-identified as Romans ( Greek : \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 , romanized : Rh\u014dma\u00eeoi ) , but are referred to as Byzantine Greeks in modern historiography . The social structure of the Byzantine Greeks was primarily supported by a rural , agrarian base that consisted of the peasantry , and a small fraction of the poor . These peasants lived within three kinds of settlements : the chorion or village , the agridion or hamlet , and the proasteion or estate . Many civil disturbances that occurred during the time of the Byzantine Empire were attributed to political factions within the Empire rather than to this large popular base . Soldiers among the Byzantine Greeks were at first conscripted amongst the rural peasants and trained on an annual basis . As the Byzantine Empire entered the 11th century , more of the soldiers within the army were either professional men-at-arms or mercenaries . Until the twelfth century , education within the Byzantine Greek population was more advanced than in the West , particularly at primary school level , resulting in comparatively high literacy rates . Success came easily to Byzantine Greek merchants , who enjoyed a very strong position in international trade . Despite the challenges posed by rival Italian merchants , they held their own throughout the latter half of the Byzantine Empire 's existence . The clergy also held a special place , not only having more freedom than their Western counterparts , but also maintaining a patriarch in Constantinople who was considered the equal of the pope .",

For a brief period in the second half of the 14th century , Germiyan Dynasty was second only to Karamanid Dynasty in its rising power .

After the defeat of the Ottomans in the Balkan Wars , the modern nation state of Albania declared independence in 1912 . In the 20th century , the Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy which formed Greater Albania before becoming a protectorate of Nazi Germany . Enver Hoxha formed Communist Albania after the Second World War and launched the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation .",

His conquests dramatically shifted the empire 's geographical and cultural center of gravity away from the Balkans and toward the Middle East . By the eighteenth century , Selim 's conquest of the Mamluk Sultanate had come to be romanticized as the moment when the Ottomans seized leadership over the rest of the Muslim world , and consequently Selim is popularly remembered as the first legitimate Ottoman Caliph , although stories of an official transfer of the caliphal office from the Abbasid Dynasty of Cairo to the Ottomans were a later invention .",

Jewish ethnicity , nationhood , and religion are strongly interrelated , as Judaism is the ethnic religion of the Jewish people , while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance . Jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE , in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel . The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE ( Late Bronze Age ) . The Israelites , as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population , consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah . Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews ' . Though few sources mention the exilic periods in detail , the experience of diaspora life , from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant , to Assyrian captivity and exile , to Babylonian captivity and exile , to Seleucid Imperial rule , to the Roman occupation and exile , and the historical relations between Jews and their homeland thereafter , became a major feature of Jewish history , identity and memory .

  "/wiki/Regent": "A regent ( from the Latin regens : ruling , governing ) is a person appointed to govern a state because the monarch is a minor , is absent , or is incapacitated . The rule of a regent or regents is called a regency . A regent or regency council may be formed ad hoc or in accordance with a constitutional rule . Regent is sometimes a formal title . If the regent is holding his position due to his position in the line of succession , the compound term prince regent is often used ; if the regent of a minor is his mother , she is often referred to as queen regent . If the formally appointed regent is unavailable or can not serve on a temporary basis , a regent ad interim may be appointed to fill the gap . In a monarchy , a regent usually governs due to one of these reasons , but may also be elected to rule during the interregnum when the royal line has died out . This was the case in the Kingdom of Finland and the Kingdom of Hungary , where the royal line was considered extinct in the aftermath of World War I . In Iceland , the regent represented the King of Denmark as sovereign of Iceland until the country became a republic in 1944 . In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ( 1569-1795 ) , kings were elective , which often led to a fairly long interregnum . In the interim , it was the Roman Catholic primate ( the archbishop of Gniezno ) who served as the regent , termed the interrex ( Latin : ruler 'between kings ' as in ancient Rome ) .

Tinos is famous amongst Greeks for the Church of Panagia Evangelistria , its 80 or so windmills , about 1000 artistic dovecotes , 50 active villages and its Venetian fortifications at the mountain , Exomvourgo . On Tinos , both Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic populations co-exist , and the island is also well known for its famous sculptors and painters , such as Nikolaos Gysis , Yannoulis Chalepas and Nikiforos Lytras . The island is located near the geographical center of the Cyclades island complex , and because of the Panagia Evangelistria church , with its reputedly miraculous icon of Virgin Mary that it holds , Tinos is also the center of a yearly pilgrimage that takes place on the date of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary ( 15 August , Dekapentavgoustos in Greek ) . This is perhaps the most notable and still active yearly pilgrimage in the region of the eastern Mediterranean . Many pilgrims make their way the 800 metres ( 2,600 feet ) from the ferry wharf to the church on their hands and knees as sign of devotion .",

  "/wiki/Polish_Jews": "The history of the Jews in Poland dates back over 1,000 years . For centuries , Poland was home to the largest and most significant Jewish community in the world . Poland was a principal center of Jewish culture , thanks to a long period of statutory religious tolerance and social autonomy which ended with the Partitions of Poland in the 18th century . During World War II there was a nearly complete genocidal destruction of the Polish Jewish community by Nazi Germany and its collaborators , during the 1939-1945 German occupation of Poland and the ensuing Holocaust . Since the fall of communism in Poland , there has been a renewed interest in Jewish culture , featuring an annual Jewish Culture Festival , new study programs at Polish secondary schools and universities , and Warsaw 's Museum of the History of Polish Jews . From the founding of the Kingdom of Poland in 1025 through to the early years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth created in 1569 , Poland was the most tolerant country in Europe . Historians have used the label paradisus iudaeorum ( Latin for Paradise of the Jews ) . The country became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world 's largest Jewish community of the time . According to some sources , about three-quarters of the world 's Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century . With the weakening of the Commonwealth and growing religious strife ( due to the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation ) , Poland 's traditional tolerance began to wane from the 17th century onward . After the Partitions of Poland in 1795 and the destruction of Poland as a sovereign state , Polish Jews were subject to the laws of the partitioning powers , the increasingly antisemitic Russian Empire , as well as Austria-Hungary and Kingdom of Prussia ( later a part of the German Empire ) . Still , as Poland regained independence in the aftermath of World War I , it was the center of the European Jewish world with one of the world 's largest Jewish communities of over 3 million .",
  "/wiki/Polish\u2013Lithuanian_Commonwealth": "The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth - formally , the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and , after 1791 , the Commonwealth of Poland - was a dual state , a bi-confederation of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch , who was both King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania . It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- to 17th-century Europe . At its largest territorial extent , in the early 17th century , the Commonwealth covered almost 400,000 square miles ( 1,000,000 km2 ) and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million . Polish and Latin were the two co-official languages . The Commonwealth was established by the Union of Lublin in July 1569 , but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had been in a de facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania 's Grand Duke Jogaila , who was crowned King jure uxoris W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o of Poland . The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the state 's size and the Commonwealth collapsed as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 . The Union possessed many features unique among contemporary states . Its political system was characterized by strict checks upon monarchical power . These checks were enacted by a legislature ( sejm ) controlled by the nobility ( szlachta ) . This idiosyncratic system was a precursor to modern concepts of democracy , constitutional monarchy , and federation . Although the two component states of the Commonwealth were formally equal , Poland was the dominant partner in the union . The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was marked by high levels of ethnic diversity and by relative religious tolerance , guaranteed by the Warsaw Confederation Act 1573 ; [ a ] however , the degree of religious freedom varied over time .",
