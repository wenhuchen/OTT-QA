  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time .",

  "/wiki/Defensive_tackle": "A defensive tackle ( DT ) is typically the largest and strongest of the defensive players in American football . The defensive tackle typically lines up opposite one of the offensive guards . Depending on a team 's individual defensive scheme , a defensive tackle may be called upon to fill several different roles . These roles may include merely holding the point of attack by refusing to be moved or penetrating a certain gap between offensive linemen to break up a play in the opponent 's backfield . If a defensive tackle reads a pass play , his primary responsibility is to pursue the quarterback , or simply knock the pass down at the line if it is within arm 's reach . Other responsibilities of the defensive tackle may be to pursue the screen pass or drop into coverage in a zone blitz scheme . In a traditional 4-3 defense , there is no nose tackle . Instead there is a left and right defensive tackle . Some teams , especially in the National Football League ( NFL ) , do have a nose tackle in this scheme , but most of them do not .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

Since joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953 , the team has won five conference championships , with the most recent title coming in 1980 . One very important contribution to the game of football by Carolina is the modern use of the forward pass ; they were the first college team to use the play in 1895 . Bob Quincy notes in his 1973 book They Made the Bell Tower Chime : John Heisman , a noted historian , wrote 30 years later that , indeed , the Tar Heels had given birth to the forward pass against the Bulldogs ( UGA ) . It was conceived to break a scoreless deadlock and give UNC a 6-0 win . The Tar Heels were in a punting situation and a Georgia rush seemed destined to block the ball . The punter , with an impromptu dash to his right , tossed the ball and it was caught by George Stephens , who ran 70 yards for a touchdown .

Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks .

Its official motto is L'\u00c9toile du Nord ( French : Star of the North ) . Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 22nd most populous of the U.S. states ; nearly 55% of its residents live in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area ( known as the Twin Cities ) . This area has the largest concentration of transportation , business , industry , education , and government in the state . Urban centers in Greater Minnesota include Duluth , Mankato , Moorhead , Rochester and St . Cloud . The geography of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture ; deciduous forests in the southeast , now partially cleared , farmed , and settled ; and the less populated North Woods , used for mining , forestry , and recreation . Thousands of years before Europeans arrived , Minnesota was inhabited by various indigenous peoples , some of whom remain in the state today . French explorers , missionaries , and fur traders began exploring the region in the 17th century , encountering the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe tribes . Much of what is now Minnesota was part of the vast French holding of Louisiana , which was purchased by the United States in 1803 ."
