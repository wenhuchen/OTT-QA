  "/wiki/Bishop_of_Faenza": "The Diocese of Faenza-Modigliana ( Latin : Dioecesis Faventina-Mutilensis ) is a see of the Catholic Church in Italy . It was created in 1986 through a merger of the diocese of Faenza and the diocese of Modigliana . Originally the diocese of Faenza ( Faventia ) was a suffragan ( subordinate ) of the Archbishop of Ravenna . In 1582 the diocese of Bologna was raised to the status of a metropolitan archbishopric by Pope Gregory XIII in the bull Universi orbis of 10 December 1582 , and Faenza was made a suffragan of the archdiocese of Bologna . On 2 April 1787 , Pope Pius VI transferred seven parishes from the jurisdiction of the bishop of Faenza to the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Ravenna . On 7 July 1850 , in the bull Ea quo licet immerito , Pope Pius IX created the new diocese of Modigliana from eight parishes in the territory of the diocese of Faenza . This action was done at the repeated request of the Grand Duke of Tuscany , Leopold II , whose political domain included the lands that became the diocese of Modigliana . The Duke was unhappy to see persons under his temporal jurisdiction subject to an ecclesiastical authority ( Faenza ) which was outside of his domain . The new diocese was assigned to the ecclesiastical province of Florence , and the Collegiate Church of S. Stefano de Mutilano became a cathedral . In 1853 , when its first bishop was appointed , Modigliana was transferred to the ecclesiastical province of Bologna . Ruggero Bovelli was appointed bishop of Modigliana on 5 August 1915 , and when a vacancy occurred in the diocese of Faenza , he was also appointed Bishop of Faenza , on 24 March 1924 , and on 1 May the decree was issued uniting the two dioceses in the person of Bishop Bovelli .

Throughout his episcopate , he greatly expanded the authority of his diocese , making it the most powerful institution in Liguria and Sardinia , and notably increased its landholdings . Pope Innocent II named Baldwin a cardinal-priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere no later than in 1137 , when he appears for the first time in this dignity . Later that year , he was in the Mezzogiorno , probably in the trail of the Emperor Lothair II . According to Peter the Deacon , he and a son of Pier Leoni ( filium Petri Leonis ) were at Montecassino to pacify a revolt when , in July , he participated in a debate over the rule of Cassinese monasticism in the presence of the emperor . He was then elected to succeed Uberto as archbishop of his native city and , as the pope was then living there in exile , was consecrated by Innocent himself . In a letter of 22 April 1138 , Innocent conferred on Baldwin the apostolic legateship over Porto Torres , Populonia , Galtelli , and Civita on Sardinia .

  "/wiki/Bishop_of_Ferrara": "The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ferrara-Comacchio ( Latin : Archidioecesis Ferrariensis-Comaclensis ) has existed since 1986 , when the diocese of Comacchio was combined with the historical archdiocese of Ferrara . It is a suffragan of the archdiocese of Bologna . The episcopal seat was transferred from Vicohabentia ( Voghenza ) to the newly founded Ferrara in 657 . The earliest known bishop of Vicohabentia is Marcellinus , who was consecrated c. 429-431 . Originally , it seems , the diocese ( or at least the diocese of Vicohabentia ) was a suffragan of the metropolitanate of Ravenna . Ferrara repeatedly contested that opinion , and claimed to be directly dependent upon the Holy See ( the Pope ) . Pope John XIII , in April 967 , confirmed that Ferrara was under papal jurisdiction , as far as election , consecration , investiture , and jurisdiction were concerned . Pope Benedict VII , in April 978 , again confirmed the papal jurisdiction in much the same language . At some point between 1106 and 1123 , however , the diocese of Ferrara fell under the control of the metropolitan of Ravenna , and Bishop Landolfo was suspended from office because of his refusal to submit to Archbishop Walter of Ravenna . Pope Innocent II restored the original independence of the diocese of Ferrara on 11 March 1133 ; but on the death of Bishop Landolfo in 1138 , the Archbishop of Ravenna asserted the right to consecrate his successor . The Ferrarese were required to produce their documentary proofs before the Pope , who issued a decree in favor of Ferrara as directly dependent upon the Holy See on 22 April 1139 . Ferrara became an archdiocese , though without suffragans , by the Bull Paterna pontificii of Pope Clement XII on 27 July 1735 ."
