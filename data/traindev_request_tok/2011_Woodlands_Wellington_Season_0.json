  "/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rowdies": "The Tampa Bay Rowdies are an American professional soccer team based in St. Petersburg , Florida . The club was founded in 2008 and first took the pitch in 2010 . Since 2017 , the Rowdies have been members of the USL Championship in the second tier of the American soccer pyramid . They formerly played in the North American Soccer League ( NASL ) ( from 2011 to 2016 ) and USSF Division 2 ( in 2010 ) , which were also second-tier leagues . The Rowdies play their home games at Al Lang Stadium on St. Petersburg 's downtown waterfront . The current club shares its name , logo , and some of its club culture with the original Tampa Bay Rowdies , who were active from 1975 until 1993 , most notably in the original North American Soccer League . The owners of the current club announced their intention to use the old Rowdies ' trademarks at its introductory press conference in 2008 . However , licensing issues forced the club to use the name FC Tampa Bay until December 2011 , when it gained full rights to the Rowdies name and other intellectual property . The current Rowdies have always used the same green and yellow color scheme and hoops as the original team , even when they could not yet use the Rowdies name . The Rowdies captured the NASL championship in Soccer Bowl 2012 , and their team shield includes two stars : one for their 2012 win and one for the 1975 Soccer Bowl championship won by the original Rowdies . The club has had a long-standing rivalry with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers , with whom they have contested the Florida Derby since the original Rowdies and Strikers first met in 1977 . In October 2018 , the Tampa Bay Rays , the area 's Major League Baseball franchise , announced plans to purchase the Rowdies and assume control of Al Lang Stadium .",
