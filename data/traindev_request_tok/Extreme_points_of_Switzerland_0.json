  "/wiki/Monte_Rosa": "Monte Rosa ( Italian : massiccio del Monte Rosa ; German : Monte Rosa-Massiv ; French : massif du Mont Rose ) is a mountain massif located in the eastern part of the Pennine Alps . It is located between Italy ( Piedmont and Aosta Valley ) and Switzerland ( Valais ) . Monte Rosa is the second highest mountain in the Alps and western Europe , after Mont Blanc . The group is located on the watershed between central and southern Europe . The Monte Rosa massif has four faces . Three in Italy : the Liskamm heading above the Val de Gressoney , the Valsesian face above Alagna Valsesia at the upper part of the Valle della Sesia , and the steep , big east wall above Macugnaga in the Valle Anzasca . And the Swiss north-western face with several glaciers ( with one of the largest Alpine glaciers ) flowing towards the Mattertal with Zermatt . Its main summit , named Dufourspitze in honor of the surveyor Guillaume-Henri Dufour and wholly located in Switzerland , culminates at 4,634 m ( 15,203 ft ) above sea level and is followed by the five nearly equally high subsidiary summits of Dunantspitze , Grenzgipfel , Nordend , Zumsteinspitze and Signalkuppe . Some other over 4000 m peaks such as Piramide Vincent , Punta Giordani , and Corno Nero are wholly in Italy . Monte Rosa is the highest mountain of both Switzerland and the Pennine Alps and is also the second-highest mountain of the Alps and Europe outside the Caucasus . The north-west side of the central Monte Rosa massif , with its enormous ice slopes and seracs , constitutes the boundary and upper basin of the large Gorner Glacier , which descends towards Zermatt and merges with its nowadays much larger tributary , the Grenzgletscher ( English : Border Glacier ) , right below the Monte Rosa Hut on the lower end of the visible western wing . The Grenzgletscher is an impressive glacier formation between the western wing of the mountain and Liskamm , a ridge on its southwestern side on the Swiss-Italian border .",
  "/wiki/Zermatt": "Zermatt is a municipality in the district of Visp in the German-speaking section of the canton of Valais in Switzerland . It has a population of about 5,800 inhabitants and is classified as a town by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office ( FSO ) . It lies at the upper end of Mattertal at an elevation of 1,620 m ( 5,310 ft ) , at the foot of Switzerland 's highest peaks . It lies about 10 km ( 6.2 mi ) from the over 3,292 m ( 10,801 ft ) high Theodul Pass bordering Italy . Zermatt is famed as a mountaineering and ski resort of the Swiss Alps . Until the mid-19th century , it was predominantly an agricultural community ; the first and tragic ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 was followed by a rush on the mountains surrounding the village , leading to the construction of many tourist facilities . The year-round population ( as of December 2018 [ update ] ) is 5,758 , though there may be several times as many tourists in Zermatt at any one time . Much of the local economy is based on tourism , with about half of the jobs in town in hotels or restaurants and just under half of all apartments are vacation apartments . Just over one-third of the permanent population was born in the town , while another third moved to Zermatt from outside Switzerland . In 1959 , Zermatt was served as a filming location for Walt Disney 's Third Man on the Mountain .",
