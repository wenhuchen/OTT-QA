  "/wiki/Scheduled_monument": "In the United Kingdom , a scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or historic building , given protection against unauthorised change . The various pieces of legislation used for legally protecting heritage assets from damage and destruction are grouped under the term designation . The protection provided to scheduled monuments is given under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 , which is a different law from that used for listed buildings ( which fall within the town and country planning system ) . A heritage asset is a part of the historic environment that is valued because of its historic , archaeological , architectural or artistic interest . Only some of these are judged to be important enough to have extra legal protection through designation . There are about 20,000 scheduled monuments in England representing about 37,000 heritage assets . Of the tens of thousands of scheduled monuments in the UK , most are inconspicuous archaeological sites , but some are large ruins . According to the 1979 Act , a monument can not be a structure which is occupied as a dwelling , used as a place of worship or protected under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 .",
  "/wiki/Listed_building": "A listed building , or listed structure , is one that has been placed on one of the four statutory lists maintained by Historic England in England , Historic Environment Scotland in Scotland , Cadw in Wales , and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency in Northern Ireland . The term has also been used in Ireland , where buildings are surveyed for the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage in accordance with the country 's obligations under the Granada Convention . However , the preferred term in Ireland is protected structure . A listed building may not be demolished , extended , or altered without special permission from the local planning authority , which typically consults the relevant central government agency , particularly for significant alterations to the more notable listed buildings . In England and Wales , a national amenity society must be notified of any work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition . Exemption from secular listed building control is provided for some buildings in current use for worship , but only in cases where the relevant religious organisation operates its own equivalent permissions procedure . Owners of listed buildings are , in some circumstances , compelled to repair and maintain them and can face criminal prosecution if they fail to do so or if they perform unauthorised alterations . When alterations are permitted , or when listed buildings are repaired or maintained , the owners are often required to use specific materials or techniques . Although most sites appearing on the lists are buildings , other structures such as bridges , monuments , sculptures , war memorials , and even milestones and mileposts and The Beatles ' Abbey Road pedestrian crossing are also listed . Ancient , military , and uninhabited structures , such as Stonehenge , are sometimes instead classified as scheduled monuments and protected by much older legislation , whilst cultural landscapes such as parks and gardens are currently listed on a non-statutory basis .",
  "/wiki/Barrington_Court": "Barrington Court is a Tudor manor house begun around 1538 and completed in the late 1550s , with a vernacular stable court ( 1675 ) , situated in Barrington , near Ilminster , Somerset , England . The house was owned by several families by 1745 after which it fell into disrepair and was used as a tenant farm . After repair by architect Alfred Hoare Powell ( 1865-1960 ) , it was the first house acquired by the National Trust , in 1907 , on the recommendation of the antiquarian Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley ( 1851-1920 ) . In the 1920s the house was renovated , the stable block turned into a residence and several outbuildings , gardens and gateways constructed . The house was originally surrounded by a medieval deer park and in the 17th century a formal garden was constructed . This had largely disappeared until a new garden was laid out by garden designer Gertrude Jekyll ( 1843 - 1932 ) in an Arts and Crafts-style . It now contains walled kitchen gardens , fruit orchards and ornamental gardens .",

The village has a population of 438 . The village is located on the southern edge of the Somerset Levels and many of the houses are built from cob and thatched with local reeds .",
  "/wiki/Tudor_architecture": "The Tudor architectural style is the final development of Medieval architecture in England , during the Tudor period ( 1485-1603 ) and even beyond , and also the tentative introduction of Renaissance architecture to England . It is generally not used to refer to the whole period of the Tudor dynasty ( 1485-1603 ) , but to the style used in buildings of some prestige in the period roughly between 1500 and 1560 . It followed the Late Gothic Perpendicular style and was superseded by Elizabethan architecture from about 1560 in domestic building of any pretensions to fashion . In the much more slow-moving styles of vernacular architecture Tudor has become a designation for styles like half-timbering that characterize the few buildings surviving from before 1485 and others from the Stuart period . In this form the Tudor style long retained its hold on English taste . Nevertheless , 'Tudor style ' is an awkward style-designation , with its implied suggestions of continuity through the period of the Tudor dynasty and the misleading impression that there was a style break at the accession of James I in 1603 , first of the House of Stuart . The low Tudor arch was a defining feature . Some of the most remarkable oriel windows belong to this period . Mouldings are more spread out and the foliage becomes more naturalistic . During the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI , many Italian artists arrived in England ; their decorative features can be seen at Hampton Court Palace , Layer Marney Tower , Sutton Place , and elsewhere . However , in the following reign of Elizabeth I , the influence of Northern Mannerism , mainly derived from books , was greater . Courtiers and other wealthy Elizabethans competed to build prodigy houses that proclaimed their status .",
  "/wiki/Manor_house": "A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor . The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system ; within its great hall were held the lord 's manorial courts , communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets . The term is today loosely applied to various country houses , frequently dating from the late medieval era , which formerly housed the gentry . They were sometimes fortified , but this was frequently intended more for show than for defence . Manor houses existed in most European countries where feudalism existed , where they were sometimes known as castles , palaces , and so on .",

  "/wiki/Hardwicke_Rawnsley": "Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley ( 29 September 1851 - 28 May 1920 ) was an Anglican priest , and a poet , local politician and conservationist . He became nationally and internationally known as one of the three founders of the National Trust in the 1890s . Rawnsley was descended from a line of Church of England vicars , and after briefly considering medicine as a career he took holy orders after graduating from Oxford . In the mid-1870s he worked with the urban poor in London and Bristol , before being appointed in 1877 to a rural parish in Westmorland in the English Lake District . He soon became a vigorous activist in the campaign to preserve the region from excessive industrial development . In 1883 Rawnsley was appointed Vicar of Crosthwaite , Cumberland , in the north of the Lake District . He remained in the post for 34 years , becoming known locally and nationally for his energetic efforts to improve life for working people . He and his wife founded the Keswick School of Industrial Art , and he led campaigns to make access to the countryside available for everyone . Concluding that protests and legislation were not enough to protect the environment , he joined Robert Hunter and Octavia Hill in 1893 to found the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty to own land on the public 's behalf . It grew to become one of Britain 's largest and most important landowners , holding land and buildings in trust for the people of Britain . Rawnsley was a prolific writer , publishing more than 40 books , including verse , sermons , historical studies , travel accounts and biographies . He retired in 1917 and moved to the village of Grasmere , in the southern Lake District , where he died in 1920 , aged 68 .",
  "/wiki/Deer_park_(England)": "In medieval and Early Modern England , a deer park was an enclosed area containing deer . It was bounded by a ditch and bank with a wooden park pale on top of the bank , or by a stone or brick wall . The ditch was on the inside increasing the effective height . Some parks had deer leaps , where there was an external ramp and the inner ditch was constructed on a grander scale , thus allowing deer to enter the park but preventing them from leaving .",

  "/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement": "The Arts and Crafts movement was an international trend in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920 , emerging in Japan in the 1920s as the Mingei movement . It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms , and often used medieval , romantic , or folk styles of decoration . It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial . It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s , and its influence continued among craft makers , designers , and town planners long afterwards . The term was first used by T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at a meeting of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887 , although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least 20 years . It was inspired by the ideas of architect Augustus Pugin , writer John Ruskin , and designer William Morris . The movement developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles and spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and America . It was largely a reaction against the perceived impoverishment of the decorative arts at the time and the conditions in which they were produced .",
  "/wiki/Bath_Assembly_Rooms": "The Bath Assembly Rooms , designed by John Wood the Younger in 1769 , are a set of assembly rooms located in the heart of the World Heritage City of Bath in England which are now open to the public as a visitor attraction . They are designated as a Grade I listed building . During the Georgian era Bath became fashionable , and the architects John Wood , the Elder , and his son laid out new areas of housing for residents and visitors . Assembly rooms had been built early in the 18th century , but a new venue for balls , concerts and gambling was envisaged in the area between Queen Square , The Circus and the Royal Crescent . Robert Adam submitted a proposal that was rejected as too expensive . John Wood , the Younger raised funding through a tontine , and construction started in 1769 . The new or upper assembly rooms opened with a grand ball in 1771 and became the hub of fashionable society , being frequented by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens , along with the nobility of the time . The building , made of Bath stone , is arranged in a U shape . There are four main function rooms in the complex : the 100-foot-long ( 30 m ) ballroom - the largest Georgian interior in Bath ; the tea room ; the card room ; and the octagon . The rooms have Whitefriars crystal chandeliers and are decorated with fine art . In the 20th century they were used as a cinema and in 1931 were taken over by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and restored . They were bombed and burnt out during the Second World War , with restoration undertaken by Sir Albert Richardson before reopening in 1963 .",
  "/wiki/Bath,_Somerset": "Bath is the largest city in the county of Somerset , England , known for and named after its Roman-built baths . In 2011 , the population was 88,859 . Bath is in the valley of the River Avon , 97 miles ( 156 km ) west of London and 11 miles ( 18 km ) southeast of Bristol . The city became a World Heritage site in 1987 . The city became a spa with the Latin name Aquae Sulis ( the waters of Sul ) c. 60 AD when the Romans built baths and a temple in the valley of the River Avon , although hot springs were known even before then . Bath Abbey was founded in the 7th century and became a religious centre ; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries . In the 17th century , claims were made for the curative properties of water from the springs , and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era . Georgian architecture , crafted from Bath stone , includes the Royal Crescent , Circus , Pump Room and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city 's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761 . Many of the streets and squares were laid out by John Wood , the Elder , and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew . Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century . Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II . The city has software , publishing and service-oriented industries .",

  "/wiki/Assembly_rooms": "In Great Britain and Ireland , especially in the 18th and 19th centuries , assembly rooms were gathering places for members of the higher social classes open to members of both sexes . At that time most entertaining was done at home and there were few public places of entertainment open to both sexes besides theatres ( and there were few of those outside London ) . Upper class men had more options , including coffee houses and later gentlemen 's clubs . Major sets of assembly rooms in London , in spa towns such as Bath , and in important provincial cities such as York , were able to accommodate hundreds , or in some cases over a thousand people for events such as masquerade balls ( masked balls ) , conventional balls , public concerts and assemblies ( simply gatherings for conversation , perhaps with incidental music and entertainments ) or Salons . By later standards these were formal events : the attendees were usually screened to make sure no one of insufficient rank gained admittance ; admission might be subscription only ; and unmarried women were chaperoned . Nonetheless , assemblies played an important part in the marriage market of the day . A major set of assembly rooms consisted of a main room and several smaller subsidiary rooms such as card rooms , tea rooms and supper rooms . On the other hand , in smaller towns a single large room attached to the best inn might serve for the occasional assembly for the local landed gentry . Formal assemblies and the associated assembly rooms faded away in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , as the range of places of public entertainment increased ( for example public dance halls and nightclubs ) and attitudes became more accepting of women from the higher social classes attending them . Also to some extent they were supplanted by the ballrooms of major hotels as British hotels became larger from the railway age onwards .",
  "/wiki/World_Heritage_Site": "A World Heritage Site is a landmark or area , selected by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) for having cultural , historical , scientific or other form of significance , which is legally protected by international treaties . The sites are judged to be important for the collective and preservative interests of humanity . To be selected , a World Heritage Site must be an already-classified landmark , unique in some respect as a geographically and historically identifiable place having special cultural or physical significance ( such as an ancient ruin or historical structure , building , city , complex , desert , forest , island , lake , monument , mountain , or wilderness area ) . It may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity , and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet . The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity , which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing , unmonitored/uncontrolled/unrestricted access , or threat from local administrative negligence . Sites are demarcated by UNESCO as protected zones .

  "/wiki/Georgian_architecture": "Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830 . It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover - George I , George II , George III , and George IV - who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830 . The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture ; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture . In the United States the term Georgian is generally used to describe all buildings from the period , regardless of style ; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are architectural in intention , and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period , though that covers a wide range . The Georgian style is highly variable , but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome , as revived in Renaissance architecture . Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition , but typically restrained , and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior . The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before , replacing English vernacular architecture ( or becoming the new vernacular style ) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period . Georgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance ; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube . Regularity , as with ashlar ( uniformly cut ) stonework , was strongly approved , imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules : the lack of symmetry , where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible , was deeply felt as a flaw , at least before John Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles . Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning . Until the start of the Gothic Revival in the early 19th century , Georgian designs usually lay within the Classical orders of architecture and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece .",

A tea room may be a room set aside in a hotel especially for serving afternoon tea , or may be an establishment which only serves cream teas . Although the function of a tearoom may vary according to the circumstance or country , teahouses often serve as centers of social interaction , like coffeehouses . Some cultures have a variety of distinct tea-centered establishments of different types , depending on the national tea culture . For example , the British or American tearoom serves afternoon tea with a variety of small cakes .",
  "/wiki/Brean_Down": "Brean Down is a promontory off the coast of Somerset , England , standing 318 feet ( 97 m ) high and extending 1.5 miles ( 2 km ) into the Bristol Channel at the eastern end of Bridgwater Bay between Weston-super-Mare and Burnham-on-Sea . Made of Carboniferous Limestone , it is a continuation of the Mendip Hills . Two further continuations are the small islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm . The cliffs on the northern and southern flanks of Brean Down have large quantities of fossils laid down in the marine deposits about 320-350 million years ago . The site has been occupied by humans since the late Bronze Age and includes the remains of a Romano-Celtic Temple . At the seaward end is Brean Down Fort which was built in 1865 and then re-armed in the Second World War . Brean Down is now owned by the National Trust , and is rich in wildlife , history and archaeology . It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to both the geology and presence of nationally rare plants including the white rock-rose . It has also been scheduled as an ancient monument .",
  "/wiki/Mendip_Hills": "The Mendip Hills ( commonly called the Mendips ) is a range of limestone hills to the south of Bristol and Bath in Somerset , England . Running east to west between Weston-super-Mare and Frome , the hills overlook the Somerset Levels to the south and the Chew Valley and other tributaries of the Avon to the north . The hills give their name to the local government district of Mendip , which administers most of the area . The higher , western part of the hills , covering 198 km2 ( 76 sq mi ) has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( AONB ) , which gives it a level of protection comparable to a national park . The hills are largely formed from Carboniferous Limestone , which is quarried at several sites . Three nationally important semi-natural habitats are characteristic of the area : ash-maple woodland , calcareous grassland and mesotrophic grassland . With their temperate climate these support a range of flora and fauna including birds , butterflies and small mammals . The dry stone walls that divide the pasture into fields are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass ( Draba muralis ) . The origin of the name Mendip is unclear , but it is known that there has been human habitation since Palaeolithic and Mesolithic times with a range of artefacts being recovered from caves . Neolithic , Iron Age , and Bronze Age features such as barrows are numerous with over 200 scheduled ancient monuments recorded . There is evidence of mining in the Mendips dating back to the late Bronze Age , which increased after the Roman invasion , particularly for lead and silver around Charterhouse . The difficult conditions in the area were noted by William Wilberforce in 1789 , which inspired Hannah More to begin her work improving the conditions of the Mendip miners and agricultural workers .",
  "/wiki/Promontory": "A promontory is a raised mass of land that projects into a lowland or a body of water ( in which case it is a peninsula ) . Most promontories either are formed from a hard ridge of rock that has resisted the erosive forces that have removed the softer rock to the sides of it , or are the high ground that remains between two river valleys where they form a confluence . Throughout history many forts and castles have been built on promontories because of their inherent defensibility . The promontory forts in Ireland are examples of this . Similarly , the ancient town of Ras Bar Balla in southern Somalia , which in the Middle Ages was part of the Ajuran Sultanate 's domain , was built on a small promontory . River confluences consistently provide an added defensive advantage to promontories , acting as a reliable natural moat for the enemy to overcome . The Citadel of Namur , a prime fortified location from the 10th century to this day , lies on the promontory at the confluence of the Meuse and Sambre rivers in the Walloon capital city of Namur , Belgium . Another good example of a confluence promontory fort is Fort Pitt , an English fort during the American Revolution that had previously belonged to the French as Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War . The surrounding location is known as the city of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .",

It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn ( Welsh : Afon Hafren ) to the North Atlantic Ocean . It takes its name from the English city of Bristol , and is over 30 miles ( 50 km ) wide at its western limit . Long stretches of both sides of the coastline are designated as Heritage Coast . These include Exmoor , Bideford Bay , the Hartland Point peninsula , Lundy Island , Glamorgan , Gower Peninsula , Carmarthenshire , south Pembrokeshire , and Caldey Island .

  "/wiki/Bridgwater_Bay": "Bridgwater Bay is on the Bristol Channel , 5 kilometres ( 3.1 mi ) north of Bridgwater in Somerset , England at the mouth of the River Parrett and the end of the River Parrett Trail . It stretches from Minehead at the southwestern end of the bay to Brean Down in the north . The area consists of large areas of mudflats , saltmarsh , sandflats and shingle ridges , some of which are vegetated . It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) covering an area of 3,574.1 hectares ( 35.741 km2 ; 13.800 sq mi ) since 1989 , and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention . The risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan . Several rivers , including the Parrett , Brue and Washford , drain into the bay . Man-made drainage ditches from the Somerset Levels , including the River Huntspill , also run into the bay . The mud flats provide a habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna . These include some nationally rare plants , beetles and snails . It is particularly important for over-wintering waders and wildfowl , with approximately 190 species recorded including Eurasian whimbrel ( Numenius phaeopus ) , black-tailed godwit ( Limosa limosa ) , dunlin ( Calidris alpina ) and wigeon ( Anas penelope ) . Fishing has taken place using shallow boats , known as flatners , and fixed wooden structures for hundreds of years . It was also the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing ' .",
  "/wiki/Weston-super-Mare": "Weston-super-Mare , also known as just Weston , is a seaside town in Somerset , England , part of the unitary authority of North Somerset . It lies by the Bristol Channel 18 miles ( 29 km ) south west of Bristol between Worlebury Hill and Bleadon Hill . It includes the suburbs of Oldmixon , West Wick and Worle . Its population at the 2011 census was 76,143 . Since 1983 , Weston has been twinned with Hildesheim , Germany . Although there is evidence in the local area of occupation since the Iron Age , it was still a small village until the 19th century when it became a seaside resort , and was connected with local towns and cities by a railway , and two piers were built . The growth continued until the second half of the 20th century , when tourism declined and some local industries closed . A regeneration programme is being undertaken with attractions including the Helicopter Museum , Weston Museum , and the Grand Pier . The Paddle Steamer Waverley and MV Balmoral offer day sea trips from Knightstone Island to various destinations along the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary . Cultural venues include The Playhouse , the Winter Gardens and the Blakehay Theatre . Partly owing to the large tidal range in the Bristol Channel , the low tide mark in Weston Bay is about 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) from the seafront . Although the beach itself is sandy , low tide uncovers areas of thick mud , hence the colloquial name , Weston-super-Mud .",
  "/wiki/Burnham-on-Sea": "Burnham-on-Sea is a large seaside town in Somerset , England , at the mouth of the River Parrett , upon Bridgwater Bay . Burnham was a small fishing village until the late 18th century when it began to grow because of its popularity as a seaside resort . Burnham-on-Sea forms part of the parish of Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge and shares a town council with its neighbouring small market town of Highbridge . According to the 2011 census the population of the parish ( including Highbridge ) was 19,576 , of which the most populous wards 'Burnham Central ' and 'Burnham North ' ; totalled 13,601 . Burnham-on-Sea is most famous for its low lighthouse . The now-decommissioned lighthouse was built in 1832 and is a Grade-II listed building . The lighthouse is famous for its red and white striped facade . The position of the town on the edge of the Somerset Levels and moors where they meet the Bristol Channel , has resulted in a history dominated by land reclamation and sea defences since Roman times . Burnham was seriously affected by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607 , with the present curved concrete wall being completed in 1988 . There have been many shipwrecks on the Gore Sands , which lie just offshore and can be exposed at low tides . Lighthouses are hence prominent landmarks in the town , with the original lighthouse known as the Round Tower built to replace the light on the top of the 14th-century tower of St Andrews Church . The 110-foot ( 34-metre ) pillar or High Lighthouse and the low wooden pile lighthouse or Lighthouse on legs on the beach were built to replace it .",

  "/wiki/Wildlife": "Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species , but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans . Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems . Deserts , forests , rainforests , plains , grasslands , and other areas , including the most developed urban areas , all have distinct forms of wildlife . While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors , most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities . Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways , including the legal , social , and moral senses . Some animals , however , have adapted to suburban environments . This includes such animals as domesticated cats , dogs , mice , and gerbils . Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred , and in modern times , concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment . The global wildlife population decreased by 52% between 1970 and 2014 , according to a World Wildlife Fund report .",
  "/wiki/History": "History ( from Greek \u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 , historia , meaning 'inquiry ; knowledge acquired by investigation ' ) is the past as it is described in written documents , and the study thereof . Events occurring before written records are considered prehistory . History is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory , discovery , collection , organization , presentation , and interpretation of information about these events . Scholars who write about history are called historians . History also includes the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events , and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them . Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing perspective on the problems of the present . Stories common to a particular culture , but not supported by external sources ( such as the tales surrounding King Arthur ) , are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends , because they do not show the disinterested investigation required of the discipline of history . Herodotus , a 5th-century BC Greek historian is often considered within the Western tradition to be the father of history , or by some the father of lies , and , along with his contemporary Thucydides , helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history . Their works continue to be read today , and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing . In East Asia , a state chronicle , the Spring and Autumn Annals , was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived . Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today . The modern study of history is wide-ranging , and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation .",
  "/wiki/Archaeology": "Archaeology , or archeology , is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture . The archaeological record consists of artifacts , architecture , biofacts or ecofacts and cultural landscapes . Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities . In Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines , while in North America archaeology is a sub-field of anthropology . Archaeologists study human prehistory and history , from the development of the first stone tools at Lomekwi in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades . Archaeology is distinct from palaeontology , which is the study of fossil remains . It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies , for whom there may be no written records to study . Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past , from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in societies across the world . Archaeology has various goals , which range from understanding culture history to reconstructing past lifeways to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time . The discipline involves surveying , excavation and eventually analysis of data collected to learn more about the past . In broad scope , archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research . It draws upon anthropology , history , art history , classics , ethnology , geography , geology , literary history , linguistics , semiology , sociology , textual criticism , physics , information sciences , chemistry , statistics , paleoecology , paleography , paleontology , paleozoology , and paleobotany .",

  "/wiki/Bronze_Age": "The Bronze Age is a historical period that was characterized by the use of bronze , and in some areas proto-writing , and other early features of urban civilization . The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system , as proposed in modern times by Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen , for classifying and studying ancient societies . An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin , arsenic , or other metals , or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere . Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time , allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage . Whilst terrestrial iron is naturally abundant , its high melting point of 1,538 \u00b0C ( 2,800 \u00b0F ) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC . Tin 's low melting point of 231.9 \u00b0C ( 449.4 \u00b0F ) and copper 's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 \u00b0C ( 1,985 \u00b0F ) placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns , which date back to 6000 BC and were able to produce temperatures greater than 900 \u00b0C ( 1,650 \u00b0F ) . Copper-tin ores are rare , as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before trading in bronze began in the third millennium BC . Worldwide , the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period , with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition . Although the Iron Age generally followed the Bronze Age , in some areas ( such as Sub-Saharan Africa ) , the Iron Age began as early as 2500 BC . Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing . According to archaeological evidence , cultures in Mesopotamia ( cuneiform script ) and Egypt ( hieroglyphs ) developed the earliest viable writing systems .",
  "/wiki/Brean_Down_Fort": "Brean Down Fort was built 60 feet ( 18 m ) above sea level on the headland at Brean Down , 9 miles ( 14 km ) south of Weston-super-Mare , Somerset , England . The site has a long history , because of its prominent position . The earliest recorded settlement is from the Early to Middle Bronze Age . The current buildings were constructed in the 1860s as one of the Palmerston Forts to provide protection to the ports of the Bristol Channel , and was decommissioned in 1901 . During World War II it was rearmed and used for experimental weapons testing . The site has been owned by the National Trust since 2002 , following a \u00a3431,000 renovation project , as part of its Brean Down property and is open to the public . The fort was used as a location for filming of the second episode , Warriors , of the BBC television drama Bonekickers .

  "/wiki/Palmerston_Forts": "The Palmerston Forts are a group of forts and associated structures around the coast of the United Kingdom . The forts were built during the Victorian period on the recommendations of the 1860 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom , prompted by concerns about the strength of the French Navy , and strenuous debate in Parliament about whether the cost could be justified . The name comes from their association with Lord Palmerston , who was Prime Minister at the time and promoted the idea . The works were also known as Palmerston 's Follies , partly because the first ones which were around Portsmouth , had their main armament facing inland to protect Portsmouth from a land-based attack , and thus ( as it appeared to some ) facing the wrong way to defend from a French attack . The name also derived from the use of the term folly to indicate a costly ornamental building with no practical value . They were criticized because at the time of their completion , the threat from the French navy had passed , largely due to the complete alignment of Napoleon III 's foreign policy with British interests then to the withdrawal of France following its crushing by Prussia in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 , and because the technology of the guns had become obsolete . They were the most costly and extensive system of fixed defences undertaken in Britain in peacetime . Some sixty years previously , there had been a similar period of defence works construction , when some 140 circular towers were built for the same purpose ( mainly along the Sussex , Kent and Suffolk coast to protect London ) called Martello Towers , but these had become outdated . The new defences were built to defend a number of key areas of the British , Irish and Channel Island coastline , in particular areas around military bases , including :",
  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",

  "/wiki/Gable": "A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches . The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used , which reflects climate , material availability , and aesthetic concerns . A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall , including the gable and the wall below it . Some types of roofs do not have a gable ( for example hip roofs do not ) . One common type of roof with gables , the gable roof , is named after its prominent gables . A parapet made of a series of curves ( Dutch gable ) or horizontal steps ( crow-stepped gable ) may hide the diagonal lines of the roof . Gable ends of more recent buildings are often treated in the same way as the Classic pediment form . But unlike Classical structures , which operate through trabeation , the gable ends of many buildings are actually bearing-wall structures . Thus , the detailing can be ambiguous or misleading . [ citation needed ] Gable style is also used in the design of fabric structures , with varying degree sloped roofs , dependent on how much snowfall is expected . Sharp gable roofs are a characteristic of the Gothic and classical Greek styles of architecture . The opposite or inverted form of a gable roof is a V-roof or butterfly roof .",

Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",
  "/wiki/Cadbury_Camp": "Cadbury Camp is an Iron Age hill fort in Somerset , England , near the village of Tickenham . It is a scheduled monument . Although primarily known as a fort during the Iron Age it is likely , from artefacts , including a bronze spear or axe head , discovered at the site , that it was first used in the Bronze Age and still occupied through the Roman era into the sub-Roman period when the area became part of a Celtic kingdom . The name may mean Fort of Cador - Cado ( r ) being possibly the regional king or warlord controlling Somerset , Bristol , and South Gloucestershire , in the middle to late 5th century . Cador has been associated with Arthurian England , though the only evidence for this is the reference in the Life of St. Carantoc to Arthur and Cador ruling from Dindraithou ( perhaps the hillfort at Dundry ) and having the power over western Somerset to grant Carantoc 's plea to build a church at Carhampton . Geoffrey of Monmouth invented the title 'Duke of Cornwall ' for Cador in his misleading History of the Kings of Britain . The 7-acre ( 2.8 ha ) hill fort is well preserved , and is managed by the National Trust through a Higher Level Stewardship agreement with Natural England which involves tree clearing , including non-native Turkey Oaks , and management of the scrub .

  "/wiki/Iron_Age": "The Iron Age is the final epoch of the three-age division of the prehistory and protohistory of humanity . It was preceded by the Stone Age ( Paleolithic , Mesolithic , Neolithic , and Chalcolithic ) and the Bronze Age . The concept has been mostly applied to Europe and the Ancient Near East , and , by analogy , also to other parts of the Old World . The duration of the Iron Age varies depending on the region under consideration . It is defined by archaeological convention , and the mere presence of some cast or wrought iron is not sufficient to represent an Iron Age culture ; rather , the Iron Age begins locally when the production of iron or steel has been brought to the point where iron tools and weapons superior to their bronze equivalents become widespread . For example , Tutankhamun 's meteoric iron dagger comes from the Bronze Age . In the Ancient Near East , this transition takes place in the wake of the so-called Bronze Age collapse , in the 12th century BC . The technology soon spread throughout the Mediterranean Basin region and to South Asia . Its further spread to Central Asia , Eastern Europe , and Central Europe is somewhat delayed , and Northern Europe is reached still later , by about 500 BC . The Iron Age is taken to end , also by convention , with the beginning of the historiographical record . This usually does not represent a clear break in the archaeological record ; for the Ancient Near East the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire c. 550 BC ( considered historical by virtue of the record by Herodotus ) is usually taken as a cut-off date , and in Central and Western Europe the Roman conquests of the 1st century BC serve as marking for the end of the Iron Age . The Germanic Iron Age of Scandinavia is taken to end c. 800 AD , with the beginning of the Viking Age .",

  "/wiki/King_Arthur": "King Arthur was a legendary British leader who , according to medieval histories and romances , led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries . The details of Arthur 's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention , and modern historians generally agree that he is unhistorical . The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources , including the Annales Cambriae , the Historia Brittonum , and the writings of Gildas . Arthur 's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin . Arthur is a central figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain . The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth 's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ) . In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work , Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore , sometimes associated with the Welsh otherworld Annwn . How much of Geoffrey 's Historia ( completed in 1138 ) was adapted from such earlier sources , rather than invented by Geoffrey himself , is unknown . Although the themes , events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text , and there is no one canonical version , Geoffrey 's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories . Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established a vast empire . Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey 's Historia , including Arthur 's father Uther Pendragon , the magician Merlin , Arthur 's wife Guinevere , the sword Excalibur , Arthur 's conception at Tintagel , his final battle against Mordred at Camlann , and final rest in Avalon .

  "/wiki/Canyon": "A canyon ( Spanish : ca\u00f1\u00f3n ; archaic British English spelling : ca\u00f1on ) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from weathering and the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales . Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces , eventually wearing away rock layers as sediments are removed downstream . A river bed will gradually reach a baseline elevation , which is the same elevation as the body of water into which the river drains . The processes of weathering and erosion will form canyons when the river 's headwaters and estuary are at significantly different elevations , particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering . A canyon may also refer to a rift between two mountain peaks , such as those in ranges including the Rocky Mountains , the Alps , the Himalayas or the Andes . Usually a river or stream carve out such splits between mountains . Examples of mountain-type canyons are Provo Canyon in Utah or Yosemite Valley in California 's Sierra Nevada . Canyons within mountains , or gorges that have an opening on only one side , are called box canyons . Slot canyons are very narrow canyons that often have smooth walls . Steep-sided valleys in the seabed of the continental slope are referred to as submarine canyons . Unlike canyons on land , submarine canyons are thought to be formed by turbidity currents and landslides .",

  "/wiki/Human_skeleton": "The human skeleton is the internal framework of the human body . It is composed of around 270 bones at birth - this total decreases to around 206 bones by adulthood after some bones get fused together . The bone mass in the skeleton reaches maximum density around age 21 . The human skeleton can be divided into the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton . The axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column , the rib cage , the skull and other associated bones . The appendicular skeleton , which is attached to the axial skeleton , is formed by the shoulder girdle , the pelvic girdle and the bones of the upper and lower limbs . The human skeleton performs six major functions ; support , movement , protection , production of blood cells , storage of minerals , and endocrine regulation . The human skeleton is not as sexually dimorphic as that of many other primate species , but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull , dentition , long bones , and pelvis exist . In general , female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population . The human female pelvis is also different from that of males in order to facilitate childbirth . Unlike most primates , human males do not have penile bones .",
  "/wiki/Cheddar_Man": "Cheddar Man is a human male fossil found in Gough 's Cave in Cheddar Gorge , Somerset , England . The skeletal remains date to the Mesolithic ( ca . 9100 BP ) and it appears that he died a violent death . A large crater-like lesion just above the skull 's right orbit suggests that the man may have also been suffering from a bone infection . Excavated in 1903 , Cheddar Man is Britain 's oldest complete human skeleton . The remains are kept by the Natural History Museum in London in the new Human Evolution gallery . Analysis of his nuclear DNA indicates that he was a typical member of the western European population at the time , probably with lactose intolerance , light eyes ( most likely green but could be blue or hazel ) , dark brown or black hair , and dark or dark to black skin . However , a subsequent report in New Scientist announced some scepticism from within the scientific community including the geneticist who worked on the findings .",
  "/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic": "The Upper Paleolithic ( or Upper Palaeolithic , Late Stone Age ) is the third and last subdivision of the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age . Very broadly , it dates to between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago ( the beginning of the Holocene ) , according to some theories coinciding with the appearance of behavioral modernity in early modern humans , until the advent of the Neolithic Revolution and agriculture . Anatomically modern humans ( i.e . Homo sapiens ) are believed to have emerged out of Africa around 200,000 years ago , although these lifestyles changed very little from that of archaic humans of the Middle Paleolithic , until about 50,000 years ago , when there was a marked increase in the diversity of artefacts . This period coincides with the expansion of modern humans from Africa throughout Asia and Eurasia , which contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthals . The Upper Paleolithic has the earliest known evidence of organized settlements , in the form of campsites , some with storage pits . Artistic work blossomed , with cave painting , petroglyphs , carvings and engravings on bone or ivory . The first evidence of human fishing is also found , from artefacts in places such as Blombos cave in South Africa . More complex social groupings emerged , supported by more varied and reliable food sources and specialized tool types . This probably contributed to increasing group identification or ethnicity . The peopling of Australia most likely took place before c. 60 ka . Europe was peopled after c. 45 ka .",

  "/wiki/Cottage": "A cottage is , typically , a small house . It may carry the connotation of being an old or old-fashioned building . In modern usage , a cottage is usually a modest , often cosy dwelling , typically in a rural or semi-rural location . The word comes from the architecture of England , where it originally referred to a house with ground floor living space and an upper floor of one or more bedrooms fitting under the eaves . In British English the term now denotes a small dwelling of traditional build , although it can also be applied to modern construction designed to resemble traditional houses ( mock cottages ) . Cottages may be detached houses , or terraced , such as those built to house workers in mining villages . The tied accommodation provided to farm workers was usually a cottage , see cottage garden . Peasant farmers were once known as cotters . The holiday cottage exists in many cultures under different names . In American English , cottage is one term for such holiday homes , although they may also be called a cabin , chalet , or even camp . In certain countries ( e.g .

It is the earlier/lower of two subperiods of the Carboniferous period lasting from roughly 358.9 to 323.2 million years ago . As with most other geochronologic units , the rock beds that define the Mississippian are well identified , but the exact start and end dates are uncertain by a few million years . The Mississippian is so named because rocks with this age are exposed in the Mississippi River valley . The Mississippian was a period of marine transgression in the Northern Hemisphere : the sea level was so high that only the Fennoscandian Shield and the Laurentian Shield were dry land . The cratons were surrounded by extensive delta systems and lagoons , and carbonate sedimentation on the surrounding continental platforms , covered by shallow seas . In North America , where the interval consists primarily of marine limestones , it is treated as a geologic period between the Devonian and the Pennsylvanian . During the Mississippian an important phase of orogeny occurred in the Appalachian Mountains . It is a major rock-building period named for the exposures in the Mississippi Valley region . The USGS geologic time scale shows its relation to other periods . In Europe , the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian are one more-or-less continuous sequence of lowland continental deposits and are grouped together as the Carboniferous system , and sometimes called the Upper Carboniferous and Lower Carboniferous instead .",
  "/wiki/Ancient_woodland": "In the United Kingdom , an ancient woodland is a woodland that has existed continuously since 1600 or before in England , Wales and Northern Ireland ( or 1750 in Scotland ) . Planting of woodland was uncommon before those dates , so a wood present in 1600 is likely to have developed naturally . In most ancient woods , the trees and shrubs have been cut down periodically as part of the management cycle . Provided that the area has remained as woodland , the stand is still considered ancient . Since it may have been cut over many times in the past , ancient woodland does not necessarily contain very old trees . For many species of animal and plant , ancient woodland sites provide the sole habitat , and for many others , conditions on these sites are much more suitable than those on other sites . Ancient woodland in the UK , like rainforest in the tropics , is home to rare and threatened species . For these reasons ancient woodland is often described as an irreplaceable resource , or 'critical natural capital ' . The analogous term used in the United States and Canada is Old-growth forest . Ancient woodland is formally defined on maps by Natural England and equivalent bodies . Mapping of ancient woodland has been undertaken in different ways and at different times , and the quality and availability of data varies from region to region , although there are some efforts to standardise and update it .",

  "/wiki/Acid": "An Acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a proton ( hydrogen ion H+ ) ( a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid ) , or , alternatively , capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair ( a Lewis acid ) . The first category of acids are the proton donors , or Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids . In the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids . Br\u00f8nsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Br\u00f8nsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ . Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/ac\u0113re meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in acid ' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution . Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic . Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) .",
  "/wiki/Last_glacial_period": "The Last Glacial Period ( LGP ) occurred from the end of the Eemian to the end of the Younger Dryas , encompassing the period c. 115,000 - c. 11,700 years ago . This most recent glacial period is part of a larger pattern of glacial and interglacial periods known as the Quaternary glaciation extending from c. 2,588,000 years ago to present . The definition of the Quaternary as beginning 2.58 Ma is based on the formation of the Arctic ice cap . The Antarctic ice sheet began to form earlier , at about 34 Ma , in the mid-Cenozoic ( Eocene-Oligocene extinction event ) . The term Late Cenozoic Ice Age is used to include this early phase . During this last glacial period there were alternating episodes of glacier advance and retreat . Within the last glacial period the Last Glacial Maximum was approximately 22,000 years ago . While the general pattern of global cooling and glacier advance was similar , local differences in the development of glacier advance and retreat make it difficult to compare the details from continent to continent ( see picture of ice core data below for differences ) . Approximately 12,800 years ago , the Younger Dryas , the most recent glacial period , began . Its end about 11,550 years ago marked the beginning of the Holocene , the current geological epoch . From the point of view of human archaeology , the last glacial period falls in the Paleolithic and early Mesolithic periods .

The trust was founded in 1895 and given statutory powers , starting with the National Trust Act 1907 . Historically , the Trust acquired land by gift and sometimes by public subscription and appeal , but after World War II the loss of English country houses resulted in many such properties being acquired either by gift from the former owners , or through the National Land Fund , later the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Lottery . Country Houses and Estates still make up a significant part of its holdings , but it is also known for its protection of wild landscapes such as in the Lake District and Peak District , historic urban properties , and nature reserves such as Wicken Fen .

At 308 metres ( 1,010 ft ) Selworthy Beacon , rising above the village , is one of the highest points on Exmoor . Its height defines as one of the 'marilyns in England . Near the summit are a series of cairns , thought to be the remains of round barrows , and the British Iron Age Bury Castle . Bossington is separated from Porlock Bay by a shingle beach , through which flows the River Horner , forming part of the Porlock Ridge and Saltmarsh Site of Special Scientific Interest . In the 1990s rising sea levels created salt marshes , and lagoons developed in the area behind the boulder bank . The village is on the South West Coast Path .",

There have been several houses on the estate over the last 500 years . In 1705 a new mansion was built which was burned down in 1779 . It was rebuilt as a hunting lodge and survived until another fire in 1851 and replaced ten years later . It became one of the centres for the Devon and Somerset Staghounds . The main building was damaged by another fire in 1941 . The house and surrounding estate were given to the National Trust in 1944 by Sir Richard Thomas Dyke Acland , 15th Baronet . The house is now operated as an hotel . The surrounding land which includes Dunkery and Selworthy Beacons , and the villages and hamlets of Selworthy , Allerford , Bossington , Horner and Luccombe as well as the Dunkery and Horner Woods National Nature Reserve contains more than 240 kilometres ( 150 mi ) of footpaths and bridleways . In the 13th and 14th centuries the estate was held by the de Holne family . During the 17th century the Staynings were lords of the manor and in the 18th descendants of FitzMartin by then known as the Martyn family had taken over . William Martin sold Holnicote to William Blackford and it descended through his family and then passed to the Dyke family .",

  "/wiki/Dunster_Castle": "Dunster Castle is a former motte and bailey castle , now a country house , in the village of Dunster , Somerset , England . The castle lies on the top of a steep hill called the Tor , and has been fortified since the late Anglo-Saxon period . After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century , William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset . A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century , and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy . At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family , who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century . The castle was expanded several times by the Luttrell family during the 17th and 18th centuries ; they built a large manor house within the Lower Ward of the castle in 1617 , and this was extensively modernised , first during the 1680s and then during the 1760s . The medieval castle walls were mostly destroyed following the siege of Dunster Castle at the end of the English Civil War , when Parliament ordered the defences to be slighted to prevent their further use . In the 1860s and 1870s , the architect Anthony Salvin was employed to remodel the castle to fit Victorian tastes ; this work extensively changed the appearance of Dunster to make it appear more Gothic and Picturesque . Following the death of Alexander Luttrell in 1944 , the family was unable to afford the death duties on his estate . The castle and surrounding lands were sold off to a property firm , the family continuing to live in the castle as tenants . The Luttrells bought back the castle in 1954 , but in 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave Dunster Castle and most of its contents to the National Trust , which operates it as a tourist attraction . It is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument .",
  "/wiki/Dunster": "Dunster is a village , civil parish and former manor within the English county of Somerset , today just within the north-eastern boundary of the Exmoor National Park . It lies on the Bristol Channel coast 2.5 miles ( 4 km ) south-southeast of Minehead and 20 miles ( 32 km ) northwest of Taunton . The United Kingdom Census of 2011 recorded a parish population of 817 . Iron Age hillforts testify to occupation of the area for thousands of years . The village grew up around Dunster Castle which was built on the Tor by the Norman warrior William I de Moyon ( d. post 1090 ) shortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066 . The Castle is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 . From that time it was the caput of the Feudal barony of Dunster . The Castle was remodelled on several occasions by the Luttrell family who were lords of the manor from the 14th to 20th centuries . The benedictine Dunster Priory was established in about 1100 . The Priory Church of St George , dovecote and tithe barn are all relics from the Priory . The village became a centre for wool and cloth production and trade , of which the Yarn Market , built by George Luttrell ( d.1629 ) , is a relic . There existed formerly a harbour , known as Dunster Haven , at the mouth of the River Avill , yet today the coast having receded is now about 0.5 miles ( 0.80 km ) from the village and no sign of the harbour can be seen on the low lying marshes between the village and the coast .",
  "/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_castle": "A motte and bailey castle is a fortification with a wooden or stone keep situated on a raised area of ground called a motte , accompanied by an enclosed courtyard , or bailey , surrounded by a protective ditch and palisade . Relatively easy to build with unskilled labour , but still militarily formidable , these castles were built across northern Europe from the 10th century onwards , spreading from Normandy and Anjou in France , into the Holy Roman Empire in the 11th century . The Normans introduced the design into England and Wales following their invasion in 1066 . Motte-and-bailey castles were adopted in Scotland , Ireland , the Low Countries and Denmark in the 12th and 13th centuries . Windsor Castle , in England , is an example of a motte-and-bailey castle . By the end of the 13th century , the design was largely superseded by alternative forms of fortification , but the earthworks remain a prominent feature in many countries .",
  "/wiki/Country_house": "An English country house is a large house or mansion in the English countryside . Such houses were often owned by individuals who also owned a town house . This allowed them to spend time in the country and in the city - hence , for these people , the term distinguished between town and country . However , the term also encompasses houses that were , and often still are , the full-time residence for the landed gentry that ruled rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832 . Frequently , the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses . With large numbers of indoor and outdoor staff , country houses were important as places of employment for many rural communities . In turn , until the agricultural depressions of the 1870s , the estates , of which country houses were the hub , provided their owners with incomes . However , the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swansong of the traditional English country house lifestyle . Increased taxation and the effects of World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses ; those that remained had to adapt to survive . While a ch\u00e2teau or a Schloss can be a fortified or unfortified building , a country house , similar to an Ansitz , is usually unfortified . If fortified , it is called a castle , but not all buildings with the name castle are fortified ( for example Highclere Castle ) .",
  "/wiki/Anglo-Saxons": "The Anglo-Saxons were a cultural group who inhabited Great Britain from the 5th century . They comprise people from Germanic tribes who migrated to the island from continental Europe , their descendants , and indigenous British groups who adopted many aspects of Anglo-Saxon culture and language ; the cultural foundations laid by the Anglo-Saxons are the foundation of the modern English legal system and of many aspects of English society ; the modern English language owes over half its words - including the most common words of everyday speech - to the language of the Anglo-Saxons . Historically , the Anglo-Saxon period denotes the period in Britain between about 450 and 1066 , after their initial settlement and up until the Norman conquest . The early Anglo-Saxon period includes the creation of an English nation , with many of the aspects that survive today , including regional government of shires and hundreds . During this period , Christianity was established and there was a flowering of literature and language . Charters and law were also established . The term Anglo-Saxon is popularly used for the language that was spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons in England and eastern Scotland between at least the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century . In scholarly use , it is more commonly called Old English . The history of the Anglo-Saxons is the history of a cultural identity . It developed from divergent groups in association with the people 's adoption of Christianity , and was integral to the establishment of various kingdoms . Threatened by extended Danish invasions and military occupation of eastern England , this identity was re-established ; it dominated until after the Norman Conquest . The visible Anglo-Saxon culture can be seen in the material culture of buildings , dress styles , illuminated texts and grave goods .",
  "/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England": "The Norman conquest of England ( in Britain , often called the Norman Conquest or the Conquest ) was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman , Breton , Flemish , and French soldiers led by the Duke of Normandy , later styled William the Conqueror . William 's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor , who may have encouraged William 's hopes for the throne . Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson . The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford , but Godwinson 's army defeated and killed Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September . Within days , William landed in southern England . Harold marched south to oppose him , leaving a significant portion of his army in the north . Harold 's army confronted William 's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings ; William 's force defeated Harold , who was killed in the engagement . Although William 's main rivals were gone , he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072 . The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated ; some of the elite fled into exile . To control his new kingdom , William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land with the Domesday Book , a manuscript record of the Great Survey of much of England and parts of Wales being completed by 1086 . Other effects of the conquest included the court and government , the introduction of the Norman language as the language of the elites , and changes in the composition of the upper classes , as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king . More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life : the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery , which may or may not have been linked to the invasion .",
  "/wiki/Shell_keep": "A shell keep is a style of medieval fortification , best described as a stone structure circling the top of a motte . In English castle morphology , shell keeps are perceived as the successors to motte-and-bailey castles , with the wooden fence around the top of the motte replaced by a stone wall . Castle engineers during the Norman period did not trust the motte to support the enormous weight of a stone keep . A common solution was to replace the palisade with a stone wall then build wooden buildings backing onto the inside of the wall . This construction was lighter than a keep and prevented the walls from being undermined , meaning they could be thinner and lighter . A gazetteer compiled by archaeologist Robert Higham counted 21 shell keeps in England and Wales . Examples include the Round Tower at Windsor Castle and the majority were built in the 11th and 12th centuries .",

The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 . The outcome of the war was threefold : the trial and execution of Charles I ( 1649 ) ; the exile of his son , Charles II ( 1651 ) ; and the replacement of English monarchy with , at first , the Commonwealth of England ( 1649-1653 ) and then the Protectorate under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell ( 1653-1658 ) and briefly his son Richard ( 1658-1659 ) . A king had never been executed before . In England , the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship was ended , while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established Protestant Ascendancy .

  "/wiki/Watermill": "A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses hydropower . It is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling ( grinding ) , rolling , or hammering . Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods , including flour , lumber , paper , textiles , and many metal products . These watermills may comprise gristmills , sawmills , paper mills , textile mills , hammermills , trip hammering mills , rolling mills , wire drawing mills . One major way to classify watermills is by wheel orientation ( vertical or horizontal ) , one powered by a vertical waterwheel through a gear mechanism , and the other equipped with a horizontal waterwheel without such a mechanism . The former type can be further divided , depending on where the water hits the wheel paddles , into undershot , overshot , breastshot and pitchback ( backshot or reverse shot ) waterwheel mills . Another way to classify water mills is by an essential trait about their location : tide mills use the movement of the tide ; ship mills are water mills onboard ( and constituting ) a ship . Watermills impact the river dynamics of the watercourses where they are installed . During the time watermills operate channels tend to sedimentate , particularly backwater . Also in the backwater area , inundation events and sedimentation of adjacent floodplains increase . Over time however these effects are cancelled by river banks becoming higher . Where mills have been removed , river incision increases and channels deepen .",

Wookey Hole cave is a solutional cave , one that is formed by a process of weathering in which the natural acid in groundwater dissolves the rocks . Some water originates as rain that flows into streams on impervious rocks on the plateau before sinking at the limestone boundary into cave systems such as Swildon 's Hole , Eastwater Cavern and St Cuthbert 's Swallet ; the rest is rain that percolates directly through the limestone . The temperature in the caves is a constant 11 \u00b0C ( 52 \u00b0F ) . The caves have been used by humans for around 45,000 years , demonstrated by the discovery of tools from the Palaeolithic period , along with fossilised animal remains . Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain . A corn-grinding mill operated on the resurgent waters of the River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086 . The waters of the river are used in a handmade paper mill , the oldest extant in Britain , which began operations circa 1610 .

In 1917 , he returned to government under David Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions , then as Secretary of State for War and Air , and finally for the Colonies , overseeing the Anglo-Irish Treaty and Britain 's Middle East policy . After two years out of Parliament , he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin 's Conservative government , returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity , a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy . Out of office during the 1930s , Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the growing threat from Nazi Germany .",

The town , which is in the Mendip district , had a population of 8,932 in the 2011 census . Glastonbury is less than 1 mile ( 2 km ) across the River Brue from Street , which is now larger than Glastonbury . Evidence from timber trackways such as the Sweet Track show that the town has been inhabited since Neolithic times . Glastonbury Lake Village was an Iron Age village , close to the old course of the River Brue and Sharpham Park approximately 2 miles ( 3 km ) west of Glastonbury , that dates back to the Bronze Age . Centwine was the first Saxon patron of Glastonbury Abbey , which dominated the town for the next 700 years . One of the most important abbeys in England , it was the site of Edmund Ironside 's coronation as King of England in 1016 . Many of the oldest surviving buildings in the town , including the Tribunal , George Hotel and Pilgrims ' Inn and the Somerset Rural Life Museum , which is based in an old tithe barn , are associated with the abbey . The Church of St John the Baptist dates from the 15th century . The town became a centre for commerce , which led to the construction of the market cross , Glastonbury Canal and the Glastonbury and Street railway station , the largest station on the original Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway . The Brue Valley Living Landscape is a conservation project managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust and nearby is the Ham Wall National Nature Reserve .

  "/wiki/Fen": "A fen is one of the main types of wetlands , the others being grassy marshes , forested swamps , and peaty bogs . Along with bogs , fens are a kind of mire . Fens are minerotrophic peatlands , usually fed by mineral-rich surface water or groundwater . They are characterised by their distinct water chemistry , which is pH neutral or alkaline , with relatively high dissolved mineral levels but few other plant nutrients . They are usually dominated by grasses and sedges , and typically have brown mosses . Fens frequently have a high diversity of other plant species including carnivorous plants such as Pinguicula . They may also occur along large lakes and rivers where seasonal changes in water level maintain wet soils with few woody plants . The distribution of individual species of fen plants is often closely connected to water regimes and nutrient concentrations . Fens have a characteristic set of plant species , which sometimes provide the best indicators of environmental conditions . For example , fen indicator species in New York State include Carex flava , Cladium mariscoides , Potentilla fruticosa , Pogonia ophioglossoides and Parnassia glauca . Fens are distinguished from bogs , which are acidic , low in minerals , and usually dominated by sedges and shrubs , along with abundant mosses in the genus Sphagnum . Bogs also tend to exist on dome-shaped landmasses where they receive almost all of their usually-abundant moisture from rainfall , whereas fens appear on slopes , flats , or depressions and are fed by surface and underground water in addition to rain .",

The surrounding water is usually understood to be continuous , though not necessarily named as a single body of water . Peninsulas are not always named as such ; one can also be referred to as a headland , cape , island promontory , bill , point , fork , or spit . A point is generally considered a tapering piece of land projecting into a body of water that is less prominent than a cape . A river which courses through a very tight meander is also sometimes said to form a peninsula within the ( almost closed ) loop of water . In English , the plural versions of peninsula are peninsulas and , less commonly , peninsulae .",

It has been designated as a scheduled monument . It has been described as the best preserved prehistoric village ever found in the United Kingdom . The site covered an area of 400 feet ( 122 m ) north to south by 300 feet ( 91 m ) east to west . It was first constructed 250 B.C . by laying down timber and clay . Wooden houses and barns were then built on the clay base and occupied by up to 200 people at any time until the village was abandoned around 50 B.C . The site was discovered by Arthur Bulleid in 1892 and excavated over the next 15 years . Artefacts uncovered include wooden and metal objects , many of which are now on display at The Tribunal in Glastonbury High Street , and in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton . Much of the timber was left at the site and soil put back on top of it as the best way to preserve it . Surveys in the late 20th and early 21st century have shown this to be effective , however the site is still at risk because of the risk of further drying out of the soil .",

Julius Caesar invaded Britain in 55 and 54 BC as part of his Gallic Wars . According to Caesar , the Britons had been overrun or culturally assimilated by other Celtic tribes during the British Iron Age and had been aiding Caesar 's enemies . He received tribute , installed the friendly king Mandubracius over the Trinovantes , and returned to Gaul . Planned invasions under Augustus were called off in 34 , 27 , and 25 BC . In 40 AD , Caligula assembled 200,000 men at the Channel on the continent , only to have them gather seashells ( musculi ) according to Suetonius , perhaps as a symbolic gesture to proclaim Caligula 's victory over the sea . Three years later , Claudius directed four legions to invade Britain and restore the exiled king Verica over the Atrebates . The Romans defeated the Catuvellauni , and then organized their conquests as the Province of Britain ( Latin : Provincia Britannia ) . By the year 47 , the Romans held the lands southeast of the Fosse Way . Control over Wales was delayed by reverses and the effects of Boudica 's uprising , but the Romans expanded steadily northward . The conquest of Britain continued under command of Gnaeus Julius Agricola ( 77-84 ) , who expanded the Roman Empire as far as Caledonia .",
  "/wiki/Britons_(Celtic_people)": "The Britons , also known as Celtic Britons or Ancient Britons , were Celtic people who inhabited Great Britain from at least the British Iron Age into the Middle Ages , at which point their culture and language diverged into the modern Welsh , Cornish and Bretons ( among others ) . They spoke the Common Brittonic language , the ancestor to the modern Brittonic languages . The traditional view that the Celtic Britons originally migrated from the continent , mostly across the English Channel , with their languages , culture and genes in the Iron Age has been considerably undermined in recent decades by the contention of many scholars that Celtic languages had instead spread north along the Atlantic seaboard during the Bronze Age , and the results of genetic studies , which show a large continuity between Iron Age and older British populations , suggesting trans-cultural diffusion was also very important in the introduction of the Celtic languages . The earliest evidence for the Britons and their language in historical sources dates to the Iron Age . After the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century , a Romano-British culture emerged , and Latin and British Vulgar Latin coexisted with Brittonic . During and after the Roman era , the Britons lived throughout Britain . Their relationship with the Picts , who lived north of the Firth of Forth , has been the subject of much discussion , though most scholars now accept that the Pictish language was related to Common Brittonic , rather than a separate Celtic language . With the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement and Gaelic Scots in the 5th and 6th centuries , the culture and language of the Britons fragmented , and much of their territory was gradually taken over by the Anglo-Saxons and Scots Gaels . The extent to which this cultural and linguistic change was accompanied by wholesale changes in the population is still a matter of discussion . During this period some Britons migrated to mainland Europe and established significant colonies in Brittany ( now part of France ) , the Channel Islands as well as Britonia in modern Galicia , Spain . By the beginning of the 11th century , remaining Brittonic Celtic-speaking populations had split into distinct groups : the Welsh in Wales , the Cornish in Cornwall , the Bretons in Brittany , the Cumbric speaking people of the Hen Ogledd ( Old North ) in southern Scotland and northern England , and the remnants of the Pictish people in the north of Scotland .

  "/wiki/Seven_Years'_War": "The Seven Years ' War was a global war fought between 1756 and 1763 . It involved all five European great powers of the time plus many of the middle powers and spanned five continents , affecting Europe , the Americas , West Africa , India , and the Philippines . The conflict split Europe into two coalitions : one was led by the Kingdom of Great Britain and included the Kingdom of Prussia , the Kingdom of Portugal , the Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( also named Hanover ) , and a few other small German states ; while the other was led by the Kingdom of France and included the Austrian-led Holy Roman Empire , including the Electorate of Saxony and most of the smaller German states , the Russian Empire ( until 1762 ) , the Kingdom of Spain , and Sweden . The Dutch Republic , Denmark-Norway , the Italian States , and the Ottoman Empire did not participate . Meanwhile , in India , some regional polities within the increasingly fragmented Mughal Empire , with the support of the French , failed to defeat a British attempt to conquer Bengal . Although Anglo-French skirmishes over their American colonies had begun in 1754 , with what became known in the United States as the French and Indian War , the large-scale conflict that drew in most of the European powers was centered on Austria 's desire to recover Silesia from Prussia . Seeing the opportunity to curtail Britain 's and Prussia 's ever-growing might , France and Austria put aside their ancient rivalry to form a grand coalition of their own , bringing most of the other European powers to their side . Faced with this sudden turn of events , Britain aligned itself with Prussia , in a series of political manoeuvres known as the Diplomatic Revolution . However , French efforts ended in failure when the Anglo-Prussian coalition prevailed , and Britain 's rise as among the world 's predominant powers destroyed France 's supremacy in Europe , thus altering the European balance of power .",
  "/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom": "George III ( George William Frederick ; 4 June 1738 [ c ] - 29 January 1820 ) was King of Great Britain and King of Ireland from 25 October 1760 until the union of the two countries on 1 January 1801 , after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death in 1820 . He was concurrently Duke and Prince-elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( Hanover ) in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814 . He was a monarch of the House of Hanover , but unlike his two predecessors , he was born in Great Britain , spoke English as his first language , and never visited Hanover . George 's life and reign , which were longer than those of any of his predecessors , were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms , much of the rest of Europe , and places farther afield in Africa , the Americas , and Asia . Early in his reign , Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years ' War , becoming the dominant European power in North America and India . However , many of Britain 's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence . Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 . In the later part of his life , George had recurrent , and eventually permanent , mental illness . Although it has since been suggested that he had bipolar disorder or the blood disease porphyria , the cause of his illness remains unknown . After a final relapse in 1810 , a regency was established . His eldest son , George , Prince of Wales , ruled as Prince Regent until his father 's death , when he succeeded as George IV .

  "/wiki/Henry_Flitcroft": "Henry Flitcroft ( 30 August 1697 - 25 February 1769 ) was a major English architect in the second generation of Palladianism . He came from a simple background : his father was a labourer in the gardens at Hampton Court and he began as a joiner by trade . Working as a carpenter at Burlington House , he fell from a scaffold and broke his leg . While he was recuperating , the young Lord Burlington noticed his talent with the pencil , and by 1720 Flitcroft was Burlington 's draughtsman and general architectural assistant , surveying at Westminster School for Burlington 's dormitory , and superintending at the site at Tottenham House . Working life in the inner circle that was driving the new Palladian architecture was an education for Flitcroft . Flitcroft redrew for publication the drawings for The Designs of Mr. Inigo Jones , published by William Kent in 1727 , under Burlington 's patronage and supervision . In May 1726 Burlington got his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 an appointment at the Office of Works , where he worked his way up from Master Carpenter and Master Mason to Comptroller of the King 's Works , a prestigious position at the top of the architectural field . Royal commissions came his way in the form of some private projects for junior members of the British Royal Family ; namely the Duke of Cumberland . His work for the Duke at Windsor Great Park included creating the Virginia Water Lake . Flitcroft 's hands were constantly occupied with private commissions and , like most professional architects ( and unlike virtuoso earls ) , he did some speculative construction in new-building London streets , supplied stone , and contracted to erect the buildings he was designing .
