He had already succeeded his father as third Baron Powis in 1667 and had been created Earl of Powis in the Peerage of England in 1674 ; Marquess of Powis and Viscount Montgomery in 1687 . When James II went into exile in France , the Marquess followed him . He served as Comptroller of the Royal Household and his wife Elizabeth as Governess of the Royal children . He was rewarded in 1698 by the titles Duke of Powis and Marquess of Montgomery , but these titles in the Jacobite Peerage ( though used ) were not recognised in England . The title of Baron Powis was created in the Peerage of England in 1629 for William Herbert . He was the son of Sir Edward Herbert , second son of William Herbert , 1st Earl of Pembroke and Anne Parr . This Herbert family were thus members of a junior branch of the prominent Welsh family headed by the Earl of Pembroke . The peerages became extinct on the death of the first Marquess 's grandson , the third Marquess , in 1748 .

Lady Nithsdale famously organised her husband 's escape from the Tower of London . A cousin of the 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury , Powis was , together with his wife , one of the leaders of the Roman Catholic party . He was one of the Five Catholic Lords falsely accused by Titus Oates in the Popish Plot of conspiring to kill the King and as a result spent six years in the Tower of London awaiting trial ; his wife 's desperate efforts to free him led her to fabricate the Meal-tub Plot for which she narrowly escaped being convicted for treason herself . Powis was finally freed in 1684 . He remained faithful to the deposed King James after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 . It was he who spirited away Queen Mary and the infant James , Prince of Wales , and took them into their French exile . As a reward , he was created Duke of Powis and Marquess of Montgomery in the Jacobite Peerage by King James . In 1690 , Powis landed in Ireland with James , where he acted as one of his principal advisers .",

Additionally , the title was created a third time by James II in exile and a fourth time by his son the Old Pretender , in the Jacobite Peerage . The name Albemarle is derived from the Latinised form of the French county of Aumale in Normandy ( Latin : Alba Marla meaning White Marl , marl being a type of fertile soil ) , other forms being Aubemarle and Aumerle .

  "/wiki/James_II_of_England": "James II and VII ( 14 October 1633O.S . - 16 September 1701 ) was King of England and Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII , from 6 February 1685 until he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 . He was the last Roman Catholic monarch of England , Scotland and Ireland ; his reign is now remembered primarily for struggles over religious tolerance . However , it also involved the principles of absolutism and divine right of kings and his deposition ended a century of political and civil strife by confirming the primacy of Parliament over the Crown . James inherited the thrones of England , Ireland and Scotland from his elder brother Charles II with widespread support in all three countries , largely based on the principle of divine right or birth . Tolerance for his personal Catholicism did not apply to it in general and when the English and Scottish Parliaments refused to pass his measures , James attempted to impose them by decree ; it was a political principle , rather than a religious one , that ultimately led to his removal . In June 1688 , two events turned dissent into a crisis ; the first on 10 June was the birth of James 's son and heir James Francis Edward , threatening to create a Roman Catholic dynasty and excluding his Anglican daughter Mary and her Protestant husband William of Orange . The second was the prosecution of the Seven Bishops for seditious libel ; this was viewed as an assault on the Church of England and their acquittal on 30 June destroyed his political authority in England . Anti-Catholic riots in England and Scotland now made it seem only his removal as monarch could prevent a civil war . Leading members of the English political class invited William of Orange to assume the English throne ; after he landed in Brixham on 5 November 1688 , James 's army deserted , and he went into exile in France on 23 December . In February 1689 , a special Convention Parliament held that the king had vacated the English throne and installed William and Mary as joint monarchs , establishing the principle that sovereignty derived from Parliament , not birth . James landed in Ireland on 14 March 1689 in an attempt to recover his kingdoms , but despite a simultaneous rising in Scotland , in April a Scottish Convention followed that of England by finding that James had forfeited the throne and offered it to William and Mary .",

  "/wiki/Duke_of_York": "Duke of York is a title of nobility in the Peerage of the United Kingdom . Since the 15th century , it has , when granted , usually been given to the second son of English ( later British ) monarchs . The equivalent title in the Scottish peerage was Duke of Albany . However , King George I and Queen Victoria granted the second sons of their eldest sons the titles Duke of York and Albany and Duke of York respectively . Initially granted in the 14th century in the Peerage of England , the title Duke of York has been created eight times . The title Duke of York and Albany has been created three times . These occurred during the 18th century , following the 1707 unification of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland into a single , united realm . The double naming was done so that a territorial designation from each of the previously separate realms could be included . The current Duke of York is Prince Andrew , the second son of Queen Elizabeth II . The present Duke 's marriage produced two daughters only , and he has remained unmarried since his 1996 divorce .

  "/wiki/Clementina_Walkinshaw": "Clementina Maria Sophia Walkinshaw ( 1720 - November 27 , 1802 ) was the mistress of Bonnie Prince Charlie . Clementina was the youngest of the ten daughters of John Walkinshaw of Barrowhill ( 1671-1731 ) and his wife Katherine Paterson . The Walkinshaws owned the lands of Barrowfield and Camlachie , and her father had become a wealthy Glasgow merchant ( founding the textile village of Calton ) . However , he was also an Episcopalian and a Jacobite who had fought for the Prince 's father in the rising of 1715 , been captured at the Battle of Sheriffmuir , before escaping from Stirling Castle and fleeing to Europe . In 1717 , he had been pardoned by the British Government and returned to Glasgow , where his youngest daughter was born probably at Camlachie . However , Clementina was largely educated on the Continent , and later converted to Roman Catholicism . In 1746 , she was living at the home of her uncle Sir Hugh Paterson at Bannockburn , near Stirling . The Prince came to Sir Hugh 's home in early January 1746 where he first met Clementina , and he returned later that month to be nursed by her from what appears to have been a cold . Given that she was living under her uncle 's protection , it is not thought the two were lovers at this time .",
