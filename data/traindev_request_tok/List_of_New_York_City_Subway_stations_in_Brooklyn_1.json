  "/wiki/Independent_Subway_System": "The Independent Subway System ( IND or ISS ) , formerly known as the Independent City-Owned Subway System ( ICOS ) or the Independent City-Owned Rapid Transit Railroad , was a rapid transit rail system in New York City that is now part of the New York City Subway . It was first constructed as the Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan in 1932 . One of three rail networks that became part of the modern New York City subway , the IND was intended to be fully owned and operated by the municipal government , in contrast to the privately operated or jointly funded Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) and Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) companies . It was merged with these two networks in 1940 . The original IND service lines are the modern subway 's A , B , C , D , E , F , G and M services . In addition , the BMT 's N , Q and R now run partly on IND trackage . The Rockaway Park Shuttle supplements the A service . For operational purposes , the IND and BMT lines and services are referred to jointly as the B Division .",

The northern section of the line , between Jay Street-MetroTech and Church Avenue , is a four-track line that was built by the IND in 1933 , running primarily underground except for a short elevated section over the Gowanus Canal . The southern section , between Ditmas Avenue and Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue , was originally built by the BMT in 1919-1920 as a three-track elevated structure between Ninth Avenue in Sunset Park and Avenue X , and as a two-track elevated structure south of Avenue X . A ramp in the neighborhood of Kensington , which opened in 1954 , connects the segment between the Church and Ditmas Avenues stations . The segment of the BMT line between Ninth and Ditmas Avenues remained as the Culver Shuttle until it was closed in 1975 and later demolished . The elevated part of the Culver Line south of Church Avenue , operated as part of the BMT until 1954 , now carries only the F , a former IND service , and is chained and signaled as part of the IND .
