Team USA 's medal haul , which included nine gold , marked the first time since the 1932 Lake Placid Games that the U.S. earned more medals than any other participant . The U.S. alpine ski team rebounded from a disappointing showing in 2006 by having its most successful Olympic performance ever , gathering a total of eight medals . Lindsey Vonn became the first American woman to win gold in the downhill event ; while Bode Miller became the most successful U.S. alpine skier in history after winning gold in the super combined as well as two other medals . Medal winning performances by Julia Mancuso and Andrew Weibrecht contributed to the team 's success . In Nordic combined , the U.S. team ended an 86-year drought during which the United States had not earned a single medal in the sport . Bill Demong won gold in the individual large hill/10 km , and Johnny Spillane won silver in both the individual normal hill/10 km and the individual large hill/10 km . Demong , Spillane , Todd Lodwick and Brett Camerota also won silver in the team event . Short track speed skater Apolo Ohno surpassed Bonnie Blair as the most decorated American Winter Olympic athlete in history with a total of eight medals in his Olympic career . Ohno gave the US relay team the final push for the bronze in the 5000 meter relay , and earned silver and bronze medals in the 1500 and 1000 meter individual events respectively . Women 's 1000 meter silver medalist Katherine Reutter broke a streak dating back to 1994 in which no American woman had medaled in an individual short track event .",
