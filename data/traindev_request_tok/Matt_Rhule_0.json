  "/wiki/2015_NFL_Draft": "The 2015 NFL Draft was the 80th annual meeting of National Football League ( NFL ) franchises to select newly eligible football players . It took place in Chicago at the Auditorium Theatre and in Grant Park , from April 30 to May 2 . The previous fifty NFL drafts ( since 1965 ) had been held in New York City . The 2015 NFL draft was the first to feature an outdoor component , where fans would be able to see the Commissioner on the Auditorium Theatre stage from across the street in the park ; this area was called Draft Town . The Tampa Bay Buccaneers held the right to select first because they had the league 's worst record in the previous season . The Arizona Cardinals made the final pick in the draft , commonly called Mr . Irrelevant . One of the major storylines approaching the NFL draft was the competition between the previous two Heisman Trophy winners , Jameis Winston winning the award in 2013 and Marcus Mariota in 2014 . Both were considered excellent prospects and had the potential to become the first overall draft selection . Winston was considered to be a more polished pocket passer and pro-style quarterback , but had several off-the-field issues while playing at Florida State , ranging from a sexual assault allegation to shoplifting incidents . Mariota was considered a better athlete , the fastest quarterback in the draft , and had a better off-the-field reputation . However , Mariota ran a spread offense at Oregon which typically had not transitioned well from college to the NFL .",

A running back may be a halfback ( in certain contexts also referred to as a tailback ) , a wingback or a fullback . A running back will sometimes be called a feature back if he is the team 's starting running back .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",
