The victory qualified Brazil for the 2003 and subsequently 2005 FIFA Confederations Cups , its fourth and fifth Confederations Cup appearance in a row . In the third place play-off match against South Korea , Turkey won 3-2 , taking third place in only their second ever FIFA World Cup , and scored the fastest goal in the FIFA World Cup history . The 2002 World Cup was also the last one to use the golden goal rule .",

At the first Olympics after World War I , countries involved in the conflict ( Germany , Austria , Hungary , and their allies Bulgaria and Turkey ) were not invited . The English FA had withdrawn from FIFA ( together with the junior partners from Scotland , Ireland and Wales ) after their demand that the federations of Germany , Austria and Hungary be excluded had been rejected . FIFA nevertheless accepted the entry of a Great Britain football team , judging that countries entering the Olympic Games in other sports should not be hindered entering the football tournament . However , the gold medalists of the previous two Olympic football tournaments would not enjoy their participation long , as they were defeated 1-3 in the first round by Norway , who thus celebrated one of their iconic victories ( to be followed by the elimination of Nazi Germany at the 1936 Berlin Olympics , the 1993 win over England in World Cup qualifying , and the 2-1 defeat of reigning world champions Brazil at the 1998 World Cup ) . The final ( and gold ) was won by host Belgium against Czechoslovakia ( which participated in an international competition for the first time in their history ) after the Czechs walked off to protest the officiating , and were subsequently disqualified from the tournament . A play-off was necessary to determine the silver medallists . France refused to play because most of their players had returned home . So Italy , Norway , Spain and Sweden played off for the right to meet the Netherlands for second place . Finally Spain won the silver medal , while the Netherlands won the bronze medal .",
