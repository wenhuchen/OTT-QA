The Inuit languages are part of the Eskimo-Aleut family . Inuit Sign Language is a critically endangered language isolate used in Nunavut . Inuit live throughout most of Northern Canada in the territory of Nunavut , Nunavik in the northern third of Quebec , Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut in Labrador , and in various parts of the Northwest Territories , particularly around the Arctic Ocean , in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region . [ note 1 ] With the exception of NunatuKavut these areas are known in the Inuit languages as Inuit Nunangat . In Canada , sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 classify Inuit as a distinctive group of Aboriginal Canadians who are not included under either the First Nations or the M\u00e9tis . The Greenlandic Inuit are descendants of ancient indigenous migrations from Canada , as these people migrated to the east through the continent . Inuit of Denmark are Danish citizens , although not the citizens of the European Union . In the United States , the Alaskan I\u00f1upiat , live primarily on the Alaska North Slope and on Little Diomede Island . In Canada and the United States , the term Eskimo was commonly used to describe Inuit , and Siberia and Alaska 's Yupik , I\u00f1upiat , and Chukchi people . However , Inuit is not accepted as a term for the Yupik and Chukchi , and Eskimo is the only term that applies to Yupik , Chukchi , I\u00f1upiat and Inuit . Since the late 20th century , Indigenous peoples in Canada and Greenlandic Inuit consider Eskimo to be a pejorative term , and they more frequently identify as Inuit for an autonym .",

  "/wiki/Franklin's_lost_expedition": "Franklin 's lost expedition was a British voyage of Arctic exploration led by Captain Sir John Franklin that departed from England in 1845 aboard two ships , HMS Erebus and HMS Terror . A Royal Navy officer and experienced explorer , Franklin had served on three previous Arctic expeditions , the latter two as commanding officer . His fourth and last , undertaken when he was 59 , was meant to traverse the last unnavigated section of the Northwest Passage . After a few early fatalities , the two ships became icebound in Victoria Strait near King William Island in the Canadian Arctic , in what is today the territory of Nunavut . The entire expedition , comprising 129 men , including Franklin , was lost . Pressed by Franklin 's wife , Jane , Lady Franklin , and others , the Admiralty launched a search for the missing expedition in 1848 . Prompted in part by Franklin 's fame and the Admiralty 's offer of a finder 's reward , many subsequent expeditions joined the hunt , which at one point in 1850 involved eleven British and two American ships . Several of these ships converged off the east coast of Beechey Island , where the first relics of the expedition were found , including the graves of three crewmen . In 1854 , explorer John Rae , while surveying near the Canadian Arctic coast southeast of King William Island , acquired relics of and stories about the Franklin party from local Inuit . A search led by Francis McClintock in 1859 discovered a note left on King William Island with details about the expedition 's fate . Searches continued through much of the 19th century . In 2014 , a Canadian search team led by Parks Canada located the wreck of Erebus west of O'Reilly Island , in the eastern portion of Queen Maud Gulf , in the waters of the Arctic archipelago .",

  "/wiki/Whaling": "Whaling is the hunting of whales for their usable products such as meat and blubber , which can be turned into a type of oil which became increasingly important in the Industrial Revolution . It was practiced as an organized industry as early as 875 AD . By the 16th century , it had risen to be the principal industry in the coastal regions of Spain and France . The industry spread throughout the world , and became increasingly profitable in terms of trade and resources . Some regions of the world 's oceans , along the animals ' migration routes , had a particularly dense whale population , and became the targets for large concentrations of whaling ships , and the industry continued to grow well into the 20th century . The depletion of some whale species to near extinction led to the banning of whaling in many countries by 1969 , and to a worldwide cessation of whaling as an industry in the late 1980s . The earliest forms of whaling date to at least circa 3000 BC . Coastal communities around the world have long histories of subsistence use of cetaceans , by dolphin drive hunting and by harvesting drift whales . Industrial whaling emerged with organized fleets of whaleships in the 17th century ; competitive national whaling industries in the 18th and 19th centuries ; and the introduction of factory ships along with the concept of whale harvesting in the first half of the 20th century . By the late 1930s more than 50,000 whales were killed annually . In 1986 , the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) banned commercial whaling because of the extreme depletion of most of the whale stocks . Contemporary whaling is subject to intense debate .",

  "/wiki/First_contact_(anthropology)": "In anthropology , first contact is the first meeting of two cultures previously unaware of one another . Notable examples of first contact are those between the Spanish Empire and the Arawak ( and ultimately all of the Americas ) in 1492 ; and the Aboriginal Australians with Europeans in 1788 when the First Fleet arrived in Sydney . Such contact is sometimes described as a discovery , such as the British and United States did with the legal theory using a Doctrine of Discovery . It is generally the more technologically complex society that is able to travel to new geographic regions to make contact with those more isolated , less technologically developed societies . However , some object to the application of such a word to human beings , which is why first contact is generally preferred . The use of the term discovery tends to occur more in reference to geography than cultures ; for an example of a common discovery debate , see Discoverer of the Americas . [ citation needed ]",

The year-numbering system used by the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world today , and is an international standard for civil calendars . The expression has been traced back to 1615 , when it first appeared in a book by Johannes Kepler as the Latin usage annus aerae nostrae vulgaris , and to 1635 in English as Vulgar [ b ] Era . The term Common Era can be found in English as early as 1708 , and became more widely used in the mid-19th century by Jewish religious scholars . In the later 20th century , the use of CE and BCE was popularized in academic and scientific publications as a culturally neutral term .

  "/wiki/Fluvial_terrace": "Fluvial terraces are elongated terraces that flank the sides of floodplains and fluvial valleys all over the world . They consist of a relatively level strip of land , called a tread , separated from either an adjacent floodplain , other fluvial terraces , or uplands by distinctly steeper strips of land called risers . These terraces lie parallel to and above the river channel and its floodplain . Because of the manner in which they form , fluvial terraces are underlain by fluvial sediments of highly variable thickness . Fluvial terraces are the remnants of earlier floodplains that existed at a time when either a stream or river was flowing at a higher elevation before its channel downcut to create a new floodplain at a lower elevation . Changes in elevation can be due to changes in the base level ( elevation of the lowest point in the fluvial system , usually the drainage basin ) of the fluvial system , which leads to headward erosion along the length of either a stream or river , gradually lowering its elevation . For example , downcutting by a river can lead to increased velocity of a tributary , causing that tributary to erode toward its headwaters . Terraces can also be left behind when the volume of the fluvial flow declines due to changes in climate , typical of areas which were covered by ice during periods of glaciation , and their adjacent drainage basins .",
  "/wiki/Pre-Columbian": "The pre-Columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history of the Americas before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continent , spanning the time of the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic period to European colonization during the Early Modern period . While the phrase pre-Columbian era literally refers only to the time preceding Christopher Columbus 's voyages of 1492 , in practice the phrase is usually used to denote the entire history of indigenous American cultures until those cultures were extinguished , diminished , or extensively altered by Europeans , even if this happened long after Columbus . The alternative terms precontact , precolonial , or prehistoric Americas are also used ; in Latin America , the usual term is pre-Hispanic . Many pre-Columbian civilizations were marked by permanent settlements , cities , agriculture , civic and monumental architecture , major earthworks , and complex societal hierarchies . Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European colonies and the arrival of enslaved Africans ( c. late 16th-early 17th centuries ) , and are known only through archaeological investigations and oral history . Other civilizations were contemporary with the colonial period and were described in European historical accounts of the time . A few , such as the Maya civilization , had their own written records . Because many Christian Europeans of the time viewed such texts as pagan , men like Diego de Landa burned them , even while seeking to preserve native histories . Only a few hidden documents have survived in their original languages , while others were transcribed or dictated into Spanish , giving modern historians glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge . Many indigenous American peoples continue traditional practices while evolving and adapting to the modern world .",
  "/wiki/Pre-Dorset": "The Pre-Dorset is a loosely defined term for a Paleo-Eskimo culture or group of cultures that existed in the Eastern Canadian Arctic from c. 3200 to 850 cal BC , and preceded the Dorset culture . Due to its vast geographical expanse and to history of research , the Pre-Dorset is difficult to define . The term was coined by Collins ( 1956 , 1957 ) who recognised that there seemed to be people that lived in the Eastern Canadian Arctic prior to the Dorset , but for whose culture it was difficult to give the defining characteristics . Hence , for Collins and others afterward , the term is a catch-all phrase for all occupations of the Eastern Canadian Arctic that predated the Dorset . To Taylor ( 1968 ) and Maxwell ( 1973 ) , however , the Pre-Dorset were a distinct cultural entity , ancestral to the Dorset , and that lived in the Low Arctic of Canada with a number of incursions into High Arctic . At the site of Port Refuge on the Grinnell Peninsula , Devon Island , McGhee ( 1979 ) distinguished two sets of occupations , one that he ascribed to the Independence I culture , the other to Pre-Dorset . Due to the often poor preservation of organic material and the fact that bones from marine mammals can appear older with radiocarbon dating than their actual age ( the marine reservoir effect ) , it is typically difficult to date Arctic sites . But the Independence I settlement is several metres higher above sea level , and McGhee took this to mean that the Independence I settlement was roughly 300 years older than the Pre-Dorset one at Port Refuge . Indeed , assuming that settlers are always close to the water , because sea levels fell over the centuries , older sites are expected to lie higher above the sea . Most features that McGhee believed different between the Pre-Dorset and Independence I settlements of Port Refuge are problematic and can not systematically be used to distinguish their cultural affiliation . It has been suggested that Pre-Dorset and Independence I are parts of the same culture .",

They developed in coastal Alaska by the year 1000 and expanded eastwards across Canada , reaching Greenland by the 13th century . In the process , they replaced people of the earlier Dorset culture that had previously inhabited the region . The appellation Thule originates from the location of Thule ( relocated and renamed Qaanaaq in 1953 ) in northwest Greenland , facing Canada , where the archaeological remains of the people were first found at Comer 's Midden . The links between the Thule and the Inuit are biological , cultural , and linguistic . [ citation needed ] Evidence supports the idea that the Thule ( and also the Dorset , but to a lesser degree ) were in contact with the Vikings , who had reached the shores of Canada in the 11th century . [ citation needed ] In Viking sources , these peoples are called the Skr\u00e6lingjar . Some Thule migrated southward , in the Second Expansion or Second Phase . By the 13th or 14th century , the Thule had occupied an area inhabited until then by the Central Inuit , and by the 15th century , the Thule replaced the Dorset . Intensified contacts with Europeans began in the 18th century .

There are 634 recognized First Nations governments or bands spread across Canada , roughly half of which are in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia . Under Charter Jurisprudence , First Nations are a designated group , along with women , visible minorities , and people with physical or mental disabilities . First Nations are not defined as a visible minority by the criteria of Statistics Canada . North American indigenous peoples have cultures spanning thousands of years . Some of their oral traditions accurately describe historical events , such as the Cascadia earthquake of 1700 and the 18th-century Tseax Cone eruption . Written records began with the arrival of European explorers and colonists during the Age of Discovery , beginning in the late 15th century . European accounts by trappers , traders , explorers , and missionaries give important evidence of early contact culture .

It is named after Cape Dorset in Nunavut , Canada , where the first evidence of its existence was found . The culture has been defined as having four phases due to the distinct differences in the technologies relating to hunting and tool making . Artifacts include distinctive triangular end-blades , soapstone lamps , and burins . The Dorset were first identified as a separate culture in 1925 . The Dorset appear to have been extinct by 1500 at the latest and perhaps as early as 1000 . The Thule people , who began migrating east from Alaska in the 11th century , ended up spreading through the lands previously inhabited by the Dorset . There is no strong evidence that the Inuit and Dorset ever met . Modern genetic studies show the Dorset population were distinct from later groups and that [ t ] here was virtually no evidence of genetic or cultural interaction between the Dorset and the Thule peoples .

  "/wiki/Inuksuk": "An inuksuk ( plural inuksuit ) ( from the Inuktitut : \u1403\u14c4\u1483\u14f1\u1483 , plural \u1403\u14c4\u1483\u14f1\u1403\u1466 ; alternatively inukhuk in Inuinnaqtun , i\u00f1uksuk in I\u00f1upiaq , inussuk in Greenlandic , and sometimes inukshuk in English ) is a manmade stone landmark or cairn built for use by the Inuit , I\u00f1upiat , Kalaallit , Yupik , and other peoples of the Arctic region of North America . These structures are found in northern Canada , Greenland , and Alaska ( United States ) . This combined region , above the Arctic Circle , is dominated by the tundra biome and has areas with few natural landmarks . The inuksuk may historically have been used for navigation , as a point of reference , a marker for travel routes , fishing places , camps , hunting grounds , places of veneration , drift fences used in hunting , or to mark a food cache . The I\u00f1upiat in northern Alaska used inuksuit to assist in the herding of caribou into contained areas for slaughter . Varying in shape and size , the inuksuit have ancient roots in Inuit culture . Historically , the most common types of inuksuk are built with stone placed upon stone . The simplest type is a single stone positioned in an upright manner . There is some debate as to whether the appearance of human- or cross-shaped cairns developed in the Inuit culture before the arrival of European missionaries and explorers . [ citation needed ] The size of some inuksuit suggest that the construction was often a communal effort . At Inuksuk Point ( Enukso Point ) on Baffin Island , there are more than 100 inuksuit . The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1969 .",
  "/wiki/Headland": "A headland is a coastal landform , a point of land usually high and often with a sheer drop , that extends into a body of water . It is a type of promontory . A headland of considerable size often is called a cape . Headlands are characterised by high , breaking waves , rocky shores , intense erosion , and steep sea cliff . Headlands and bays are often found on the same coastline . A bay is flanked by land on three sides , whereas a headland is flanked by water on three sides . Headlands and bays form on discordant coastlines , where bands of rock of alternating resistance run perpendicular to the coast . Bays form when weak ( less resistant ) rocks ( such as sands and clays ) are eroded , leaving bands of stronger ( more resistant ) rocks ( such as chalk , limestone , granite ) forming a headland , or peninsula . Through the deposition of sediment within the bay and the erosion of the headlands , coastlines eventually straighten out then start the same process all over again .",

Tuapait Island lies to the north . Beacon Island , Kekertukdjuak Island , Miliakdjuin Island , Tesseralik Island , and Ugpitimik Island are in the vicinity . Kekerten Territorial Park is located on the island . Scottish whalers had been fishing in the Cumberland Sound since the early 19th century and with the arrival of the American whalers in the 1850s winter stations were established . The Aberdeen whaler , Cpt . William Penny spent several winters around 1883-84 at Kekerten . In 1915 , Kekerten was purchased by Robert Kinnes & Co. and operated as a trading post until it was sold to the Hudson 's Bay Company in 1923 . With the establishment of the main HBC post at Pangnirtung , Kekerten was abandoned in 1925 .",

  "/wiki/Martin_Frobisher": "Sir Martin Frobisher ( /\u02c8fro\u028ab\u026a\u0283\u0259r/ ; c. 1535 - 22 November 1594 ) was an English seaman and privateer who made three voyages to the New World looking for the North-west Passage . He probably sighted Resolution Island near Labrador in north-eastern Canada , before entering Frobisher Bay and landing on present-day Baffin Island . On his second voyage , Frobisher found what he thought was gold ore and carried 200 tons of it home on three ships , where initial assaying determined it to be worth a profit of \u00a35.20 per ton . Encouraged , Frobisher returned to Canada with an even larger fleet and dug several mines around Frobisher Bay . He carried 1,350 tons of the ore back to England , where , after years of smelting , it was realised that the ore was comparatively worthless iron pyrite ( 'fool 's gold ' ) . As an English privateer , he plundered riches from French ships . He was later knighted for his service in repelling the Spanish Armada in 1588 .",
  "/wiki/Canadian_Arctic_Archipelago": "The Arctic Archipelago , also known as the Canadian Arctic Archipelago , groups together all islands lying to the north of the Canadian continental mainland excluding Greenland ( an autonomous territory of Denmark ) . Situated in the northern extremity of North America and covering about 1,424,500 km2 ( 550,000 sq mi ) , this group of 36,563 islands in the Arctic Sea comprises much of the territory of Northern Canada - most of Nunavut and part of the Northwest Territories .

  "/wiki/Norse_colonization_of_the_Americas": "The Norse colonization of North America began in the late 10th century AD when Norsemen explored and settled areas of the North Atlantic including the northeastern fringes of North America . Remains of Norse buildings were found at L'Anse aux Meadows near the northern tip of Newfoundland in 1960 . This discovery aided the reignition of archaeological exploration for the Norse in the North Atlantic . The Norse settlements in the North American island of Greenland lasted for almost 500 years . L'Anse aux Meadows , the only confirmed Norse site in present-day Canada , was small and did not last as long . While voyages , for example to collect timber , are likely to have occurred for some time , there is no evidence of any lasting Norse settlements on mainland North America .",
  "/wiki/Breadalbane_(ship)": "Breadalbane was an 1843 British three-masted merchant barque that was crushed by ice and sank in the Arctic in 1853. Notable as one of the northernmost shipwrecks known , she is also considered one of the best-preserved wooden ships ever found in the sea due to slow deterioration in the cold Arctic water . Historically , Breadalbane is considered to be a time capsule . On 21 August 1853 , she became trapped by an ice floe and was crushed . She sank to the bottom of the Northwest Passage near Beechey Island in Lancaster Sound , approximately 500 miles ( 800 km ) north of the Arctic Circle . Her entire crew of 21 abandoned ship in time and were rescued by her companion , HMS Phoenix . In August 1980 , the wreck was discovered by a five-man team led by Joe MacInnis working from the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker Sir John A. McDonald .

  "/wiki/Sea_ice": "Sea ice arises as seawater freezes . Because ice is less dense than water , it floats on the ocean 's surface ( as does fresh water ice , which has an even lower density ) . Sea ice covers about 7% of the Earth 's surface and about 12% of the world 's oceans . Much of the world 's sea ice is enclosed within the polar ice packs in the Earth 's polar regions : the Arctic ice pack of the Arctic Ocean and the Antarctic ice pack of the Southern Ocean . Polar packs undergo a significant yearly cycling in surface extent , a natural process upon which depends the Arctic ecology , including the ocean 's ecosystems . Due to the action of winds , currents and temperature fluctuations , sea ice is very dynamic , leading to a wide variety of ice types and features . Sea ice may be contrasted with icebergs , which are chunks of ice shelves or glaciers that calve into the ocean . Depending on location , sea ice expanses may also incorporate icebergs ."
