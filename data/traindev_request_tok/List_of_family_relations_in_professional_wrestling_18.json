Their exploits captured the attention of the American press and its readership during what is occasionally referred to as the public enemy era between 1931 and 1934 . They are believed to have murdered at least nine police officers and four civilians . They were killed in May 1934 during an ambush by police near Gibsland , Louisiana . The press ' portrayal of Bonnie and Clyde was sometimes at odds with the reality of their life on the road , especially for Parker . She was present at 100 or more felonies during the two years that she was Barrow 's companion , although she was not the cigar-smoking , machine gun-wielding killer depicted in newspapers , newsreels , and pulp detective magazines of the day . Nonetheless , numerous police accounts detail her attempts to murder police officers ( although gang member W.D . Jones contradicted them at trial ) . The picture of Parker smoking a cigar came from an undeveloped roll of negatives that police found at an abandoned hideout , and the snapshot was published nationwide . Parker did chain smoke Camel cigarettes , although she never smoked cigars . [ notes 1 ] According to historian Jeff Guinn , the photos found at the hideout resulted in Parker 's glamorization and the creation of myths about the gang . The 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde , directed by Arthur Penn and starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in the title roles , revived interest in the criminals and glamorized them with a romantic aura .",
