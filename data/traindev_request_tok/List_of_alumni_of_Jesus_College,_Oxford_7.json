The royal charter issued by Elizabeth appointed a Principal and various Fellows , Scholars and Commissioners : the Fellows to educate the Scholars and to run the college , under the overall direction of the Principal ; and the Commissioners to draw up statutes for the governance of the college , its officers and servants , and the management of the college property . The college was founded to help with the increased numbers of Welsh students at Oxford , and the founding Fellows included a number of individuals with links to Wales . The Commissioners included prominent individuals such as William Cecil , Lord Burghley , the Principal Secretary of State . The charter also gave land and buildings in Oxford to the new college . Whilst the foundation process of the college started in 1571 , it took more than fifty years and a further two charters , one in 1589 from Elizabeth and one in 1622 from her successor , James I , to complete the process . These further charters were necessary because neither the Commissioners appointed by the 1571 charter nor those appointed by the 1589 charter fulfilled their allotted task of drawing up statutes . During this time , Griffith Powell ( one of the Fellows who was pressing for statutes to be drawn up ) concluded that successive Principals were loath to have statutes , since these would limit the Principal 's powers . One Principal lost a draft copy of the statutes ; the next kept the next draft in his study for several years without taking steps to have them confirmed by the Commissioners . It was not until after the 1622 charter that statutes were approved by the Commissioners and the college was fully constituted . Despite the intention on the foundation of the college , none of the charters made special provision for Welsh students , although the students were predominantly Welsh from the outset .",

Although initially restricted to male applicants from countries which are today within the British Commonwealth , as well as Germany and the United States , today the scholarship is open to applicants from all backgrounds and from across the globe . Since its creation , controversy has surrounded both its former exclusion of women ( thus leading to the establishment of the co-educational Marshall Scholarship ) , and Rhodes ' white supremacist beliefs and legacy of colonialism . Prominent recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship include politicians , academics , scientists , authors and entrepreneurs . Notable American politicians include former president of the United States Bill Clinton , former United States national security advisor and United States ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice , former governor of Louisiana Piyush Bobby Jindal , former United States secretary of the Air Force and former congresswoman Heather Wilson , and former United States secretary of health and human services Sylvia Matthews Burwell .

  "/wiki/Modern_History": "The history of the world , in common parlance , is the history of humanity ( or human history ) , as determined from archeology , anthropology , genetics , linguistics , and other disciplines ; and , for periods since the invention of writing , from recorded history and from secondary sources and studies . Humanity 's written history was preceded by its prehistory , beginning with the Palaeolithic Era ( Old Stone Age ) , followed by the Neolithic Era ( New Stone Age ) . The Neolithic saw the Agricultural Revolution begin , between 8000 and 5000 BCE , in the Near East 's Fertile Crescent . During this period , humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals . As agriculture advanced , most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements . The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units , fostered by advances in transportation . Whether in prehistoric or historic times , people always needed to be near reliable sources of potable water . Settlements developed on river banks as early as 3000 BCE in Mesopotamia , on the banks of Egypt 's Nile River , in the Indus River valley , and along China 's rivers . As farming developed , grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons . Labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities , which provided the foundation for civilization . The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing . With civilizations flourishing , ancient history ( Antiquity , including the Classical Age , up to about 500 CE ) saw the rise and fall of empires .",
