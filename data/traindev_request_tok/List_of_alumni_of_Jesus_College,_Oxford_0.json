  "/wiki/Victoria_Cross": "The Victoria Cross ( VC ) is the highest and most prestigious award of the British honours system . It is awarded for valour in the presence of the enemy to members of the British Armed Forces . It may be awarded posthumously . It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries , most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours . It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879 . Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857 , two-thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch . These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace . The VC was introduced on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to honour acts of valour during the Crimean War . Since then , the medal has been awarded 1,358 times to 1,355 individual recipients . Only 15 medals , of which 11 were to members of the British Army and four were to members of the Australian Army , have been awarded since the Second World War . The traditional explanation of the source of the metal from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian cannon captured at the Siege of Sevastopol .

The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 . The outcome of the war was threefold : the trial and execution of Charles I ( 1649 ) ; the exile of his son , Charles II ( 1651 ) ; and the replacement of English monarchy with , at first , the Commonwealth of England ( 1649-1653 ) and then the Protectorate under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell ( 1653-1658 ) and briefly his son Richard ( 1658-1659 ) . A king had never been executed before . In England , the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship was ended , while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established Protestant Ascendancy .

It involved all five European great powers of the time plus many of the middle powers and spanned five continents , affecting Europe , the Americas , West Africa , India , and the Philippines . The conflict split Europe into two coalitions : one was led by the Kingdom of Great Britain and included the Kingdom of Prussia , the Kingdom of Portugal , the Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( also named Hanover ) , and a few other small German states ; while the other was led by the Kingdom of France and included the Austrian-led Holy Roman Empire , including the Electorate of Saxony and most of the smaller German states , the Russian Empire ( until 1762 ) , the Kingdom of Spain , and Sweden . The Dutch Republic , Denmark-Norway , the Italian States , and the Ottoman Empire did not participate . Meanwhile , in India , some regional polities within the increasingly fragmented Mughal Empire , with the support of the French , failed to defeat a British attempt to conquer Bengal . Although Anglo-French skirmishes over their American colonies had begun in 1754 , with what became known in the United States as the French and Indian War , the large-scale conflict that drew in most of the European powers was centered on Austria 's desire to recover Silesia from Prussia . Seeing the opportunity to curtail Britain 's and Prussia 's ever-growing might , France and Austria put aside their ancient rivalry to form a grand coalition of their own , bringing most of the other European powers to their side . Faced with this sudden turn of events , Britain aligned itself with Prussia , in a series of political manoeuvres known as the Diplomatic Revolution . However , French efforts ended in failure when the Anglo-Prussian coalition prevailed , and Britain 's rise as among the world 's predominant powers destroyed France 's supremacy in Europe , thus altering the European balance of power .",

The action was the culmination of a campaign that had criss-crossed the Bay of Biscay over the previous month in which both sides had captured numerous merchant ships and minor warships and had engaged in two partial , but inconclusive , fleet actions . The British Channel Fleet under Admiral Lord Howe attempted to prevent the passage of a vital French grain convoy from the United States , which was protected by the French Atlantic Fleet , commanded by Rear-Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse . The two forces clashed in the Atlantic Ocean , some 400 nautical miles ( 700 km ) west of the French island of Ushant on 1 June 1794 . During the battle , Howe defied naval convention by ordering his fleet to turn towards the French and for each of his vessels to rake and engage their immediate opponent . This unexpected order was not understood by all of his captains , and as a result his attack was more piecemeal than he intended . Nevertheless , his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the French fleet . In the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered ; in no condition for further combat , Howe and Villaret returned to their home ports . Despite losing seven of his ships of the line , Villaret had bought enough time for the French grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by Howe 's fleet , securing a strategic success . However , he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port , leaving the British free to conduct a campaign of blockade for the remainder of the war . In the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies . The Glorious First of June demonstrated a number of the major problems inherent in the French and British navies at the start of the Revolutionary Wars .",

The mutinies were extremely concerning for Britain , because at the time the country was at war with Revolutionary France , and the Navy was the most significant component of the war effort .
