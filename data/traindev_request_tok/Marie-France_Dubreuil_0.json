It was normally the second of three programs in the competition , sandwiched between the compulsory dance ( CD ) and the free dance ( FD ) . The rhythm ( s ) and type of music required for the OD changed every season , and were selected by the International Skating Union ( ISU ) before the start of the season . The ice dancers were free to choose their own music and choreography ( within the specified constraints ) and to create their own routines .
