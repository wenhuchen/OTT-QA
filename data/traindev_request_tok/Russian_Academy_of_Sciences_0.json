This policy of non-recognition gave rise to the principle of legal continuity , which held that de jure , Estonia remained an independent state under occupation throughout the period 1940-91 . On 16 November 1988 , the Estonian SSR became the first republic within the Soviet sphere of influence to declare state sovereignty from Moscow .
