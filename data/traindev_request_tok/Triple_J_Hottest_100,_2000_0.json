  "/wiki/My_Happiness_(Powderfinger_song)": "My Happiness is a song by Australian rock band Powderfinger . It was released on record label Universal Music Australia on 21 August 2000 as the first single from the band 's fourth album , Odyssey Number Five . The single is Powderfinger 's most successful ; it peaked at number 4 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart , number 7 on the New Zealand Singles Chart , and charted in the United States on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart - reaching number 23 , the first Powderfinger song to do so . Powderfinger frontman Bernard Fanning wrote the lyrics for My Happiness as a reflection on the time the band spent touring to promote their work , and the loneliness that came as a result . It was inspired by his love of gospel and soul music . The rest of the band are co-credited with Fanning for composing the track . Despite its melancholy mood , My Happiness is considered by many to be a love song , a suggestion Fanning regards as mystifying . My Happiness was released as a single with My Kind of Scene as a B-side . It was instantly successful , charting highly in Australia and New Zealand . It won an ARIA Award and an APRA Award and topped the Triple J Hottest 100 in 2000 as well as coming 27th in the 2009 Hottest 100 of all time . My Happiness was highly praised by critics , with even negative reviews of Odyssey Number Five noting it as a highlight , especially for its catchy chorus . One of the highlights of Powderfinger 's United States tour with Coldplay was a performance of My Happiness on the Late Show with David Letterman ; they were only the fourth Australian act to appear on the show .",

  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

Like many tracks from All That You Ca n't Leave Behind , Beautiful Day harkens back to the group 's past sound . The tone of the Edge 's guitar was a subject of debate amongst the band members , as they disagreed on whether he should use a sound similar to that from their early career in the 1980s . The band 's lead vocalist Bono explained that the upbeat track is about losing everything but still finding joy in what one has . The song received positive reviews , and it became the band 's 14th number-one single in their native Ireland , fourth number-one in the United Kingdom , and their first number-one in the Netherlands . It also topped the charts in Australia , Canada , Finland , Italy , Norway , Scotland and Spain , and reached the top 10 in Austria , Belgium , Germany , New Zealand , Sweden and Switzerland .

Their lyrics , often embellished with spiritual imagery , focus on personal and sociopolitical themes . Popular for their live performances , the group have staged several ambitious and elaborate tours over their career . The band formed as teenagers while attending Mount Temple Comprehensive School , when they had limited musical proficiency . Within four years , they signed with Island Records and released their debut album , Boy ( 1980 ) . Subsequent work such as their first UK number-one album , War ( 1983 ) , and the singles Sunday Bloody Sunday and Pride ( In the Name of Love ) helped establish U2 's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group . By the mid-1980s , they had become renowned globally for their live act , highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985 . The group 's fifth album , The Joshua Tree ( 1987 ) , made them international superstars and was their greatest critical and commercial success . Topping music charts around the world , it produced their only number-one singles in the US to date : With or Without You and I Still Have n't Found What I 'm Looking For . Facing creative stagnation and a backlash following their documentary/double album , Rattle and Hum ( 1988 ) , U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s through a new musical direction and public image .",
