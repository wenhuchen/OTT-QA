  "/wiki/Sega": "Sega Games Co. , Ltd. [ a ] is a Japanese multinational video game developer and publisher headquartered in Shinagawa , Tokyo . Its international branches , Sega of America and Sega Europe , are respectively headquartered in Irvine , California , and London . Sega 's arcade division , once part of Sega Corporation , has existed as Sega Interactive Co. , Ltd. since 2015 . Both companies are subsidiaries of Sega Holdings Co. , Ltd. , which is in turn a part of Sega Sammy Holdings . From 1983 until 2001 , Sega also developed and sold video game consoles . Sega was founded by Martin Bromley and Richard Stewart as Nihon Goraku Bussan [ b ] on June 3 , 1960 . The company became known as Sega Enterprises , Ltd. after acquiring Rosen Enterprises , an importer of coin-operated games . Sega developed its first coin-operated game with Periscope in the late 1960s . In an effort to become a publicly traded company , Sega was sold to Gulf and Western Industries in 1969 . Following a downturn in the arcade business in the early 1980s , Sega began to develop video game consoles , starting with the SG-1000 and Master System , but struggled against competitors such as the Nintendo Entertainment System . In 1984 , Sega executives David Rosen and Hayao Nakayama led a management buyout of the company with backing from CSK Corporation . Sega released its next console , the Sega Genesis ( known as the Mega Drive outside North America ) , in 1988 .",

  "/wiki/Flicky": "Flicky [ a ] is a platform game developed by Sega and released in arcades in May 1984 . In Flicky , the player controls the eponymous blue bird and must gather all the small birds called Chirps in each round and bring them safely to the exit . There are cat and lizard enemies which can disperse the Chirps and kill the player , but Flicky can use items on the playing field to protect herself and the Chirps from danger . The idea for Flicky came from Sega senior leadership , who wanted to exceed the success of Namco 's Mappy ( 1983 ) . Yoji Ishii and Yoshiki Kawasaki developed Flicky at Sega over one year . Originally , the game simply had the player catch ambiguous dots in a maze . Taking inspiration from a popular song in a Japanese variety show , Kawasaki gave the game an urban theme and bird characters . The game was originally titled Busty , then Flippy , before finally settling on Flicky . Flicky was first ported to the SG-1000 in Japan , and then later to other Japanese home consoles . In 1991 , Flicky was released in North America and Europe on the Sega Genesis . The character has continued to hold cameo appearances in Sega video games , most notably within the Sonic the Hedgehog series .",
