The Abbey , which is located at the centre of the island , was founded in the 12th century during the episcopate of Gregoir , Bishop of Dunkeld . Later tradition placed it even earlier , in the reign of King Alexander I of Scotland ( 1107-24 ) , who probably had some involvement in the island ; he was apparently washed ashore there after a shipwreck in 1123 , and took shelter in a hermit 's hovel . The Abbey was first used as a priory by Augustinian canons regular , becoming a full abbey in 1235 . The island was attacked by the English from 1296 onwards , and the Abbey was abandoned after the Scottish Reformation in 1560 . It has since been used for defensive purposes , as it is situated in a strategically important position in the middle of the Firth of Forth . A medieval inscription carved above the Abbey 's entrance reads Stet domus haec donec fluctus formica marinos ebibat , et totum testudo perambulet orbem , or , May this house stand until an ant drains the flowing sea , and a tortoise walks around the whole world . Inchcolm Abbey has the most complete surviving remains of any Scottish monastic house . The cloisters , chapter house , warming house , and refectory are all complete , and most of the remaining claustral buildings survive in a largely complete state .

The youngest son of Malcolm III and Margaret of Wessex , David spent most of his childhood in Scotland , but was exiled to England temporarily in 1093 . Perhaps after 1100 , he became a dependent at the court of King Henry I . There he was influenced by the Anglo-French culture of the court . When David 's brother Alexander I died in 1124 , David chose , with the backing of Henry I , to take the Kingdom of Scotland ( Alba ) for himself . He was forced to engage in warfare against his rival and nephew , M\u00e1el Coluim mac Alaxandair . Subduing the latter seems to have taken David ten years , a struggle that involved the destruction of \u00d3engus , Mormaer of Moray . David 's victory allowed expansion of control over more distant regions theoretically part of his Kingdom . After the death of his former patron Henry I , David supported the claims of Henry 's daughter and his own niece , Empress Matilda , to the throne of England . In the process , he came into conflict with King Stephen and was able to expand his power in northern England , despite his defeat at the Battle of the Standard in 1138 . The term Davidian Revolution is used by many scholars to summarise the changes which took place in Scotland during his reign . These included his foundation of burghs and regional markets , implementation of the ideals of Gregorian Reform , foundation of monasteries , Normanisation of the Scottish government , and the introduction of feudalism through immigrant French and Anglo-French knights .",

  "/wiki/Edinburgh_Castle": "Edinburgh Castle is a historic fortress which dominates the skyline of Edinburgh , the capital city of Scotland , from its position on the Castle Rock . Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock since at least the Iron Age ( 2nd century AD ) , although the nature of the early settlement is unclear . There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century , and the site continued at times to be a royal residence until 1633 . From the 15th century , the castle 's residential role declined , and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison . Its importance as a part of Scotland 's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards , and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half . As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland , Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite rising of 1745 . Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1100-year-old history , giving it a claim to having been the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world . Few of the present buildings pre-date the Lang Siege of the 16th century when the medieval defences were largely destroyed by artillery bombardment . The most notable exceptions are St Margaret 's Chapel from the early 12th century , which is regarded as the oldest building in Edinburgh , the Royal Palace and the early-16th-century Great Hall , although the interiors have been much altered from the mid-Victorian period onwards . The castle also houses the Scottish regalia , known as the Honours of Scotland and is the site of the Scottish National War Memorial and the National War Museum of Scotland . The British Army is still responsible for some parts of the castle , although its presence is now largely ceremonial and administrative .

The most famous prior undoubtedly was the chronicler , Andrew de Wyntoun who probably wrote his Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland on Loch Leven .

Although his origins are obscure in detail , William was said to have been a clerk of Paris . Saga tradition had it that William had been bishop for 66 years when he died in 1168 , meaning that his accession to the bishopric would have been around 1102 . There is no contemporary evidence of his episcopate until a letter of Pope Honorius II in 1128 , which even then does not name William specifically , but rather only mentions a bishop holding office at the same time as Radulf Novell . He was however definitively in charge by December 1135 during the earldom of Earl Paul Haakonsson . Bishop William was a promoter of the cult of St Magnus , and was allegedly witness to some posthumous miraculous activity of the former earl . William had St Magnus ' relics transferred to Kirkwall , fixing the episcopal seat at this location and , with the assistance of Earl Rognvald Kali Kolsson , constructing a new cathedral there . It was probably for these reasons that William was remembered in later Orcadian tradition , saga and ecclesiastical , as the founding bishop of Orkney . Along with Earl Rognvald , between 1151 and 1153 William went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land . In 1153/4 the bishopric of Orkney came firmly into the Scandinavian fold , as opposed to the York or St Andrews fold , when the Papal legate Nicholas Breakspear arrived in Norway to create a new Archbishopric of Trondheim ( Ni\u00f0aros ) embracing the Orcadian see .",

The see , however , remained under the nominal control of Trondheim until the creation of the Archbishopric of St Andrews in 1472 , when it became for the first time an officially Scottish bishopric . The Bishopric 's links with Rome ceased to exist after the Scottish Reformation . The bishopric continued , saving temporary abolition between 1638 and 1661 , under the episcopal Church of Scotland until the Glorious Revolution of 1688 . Episcopacy in the established church in Scotland was permanently abolished in 1689 , but a Scottish Episcopal Church bishopric encompassing Orkney was created in 1865 , as the Bishopric of Aberdeen and Orkney .

  "/wiki/Islay": "Islay ( /\u02c8a\u026al\u0259/ ( listen ) EYE-l\u0259 ; Scottish Gaelic : \u00ccle ) is the southernmost island of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland . Known as The Queen of the Hebrides , it lies in Argyll just south west of Jura and around 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) north of the Northern Irish coast . The island 's capital is Bowmore where the distinctive round Kilarrow Parish Church and a distillery are located . Port Ellen is the main port . Islay is the fifth-largest Scottish island and the eighth-largest island of the British Isles , with a total area of almost 620 square kilometres ( 239 sq mi ) . [ Note 1 ] There is ample evidence of the prehistoric settlement of Islay and the first written reference may have come in the 1st century AD . The island had become part of the Gaelic Kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata during the Early Middle Ages before being absorbed into the Norse Kingdom of the Isles . The later medieval period marked a cultural high point with the transfer of the Hebrides to the Kingdom of Scotland and the emergence of the Clan Donald Lordship of the Isles , originally centred at Finlaggan . During the 17th century the Clan Donald star waned , but improvements to agriculture and transport led to a rising population , which peaked in the mid-19th century . This was followed by substantial forced displacements and declining resident numbers . Today , it has over 3,000 inhabitants and the main commercial activities are agriculture , malt whisky distillation and tourism . The island has a long history of religious observance and Scottish Gaelic is spoken by about a quarter of the population .",

  "/wiki/Romanesque_architecture": "Romanesque architecture is an architectural style of medieval Europe characterized by semi-circular arches . There is no consensus for the beginning date of the Romanesque style , with proposals ranging from the 6th to the 11th century , this later date being the most commonly held . In the 12th century it developed into the Gothic style , marked by pointed arches . Examples of Romanesque architecture can be found across the continent , making it the first pan-European architectural style since Imperial Roman architecture . The Romanesque style in England is traditionally referred to as Norman architecture . Combining features of ancient Roman and Byzantine buildings and other local traditions , Romanesque architecture is known by its massive quality , thick walls , round arches , sturdy pillars , barrel vaults , large towers and decorative arcading . Each building has clearly defined forms , frequently of very regular , symmetrical plan ; the overall appearance is one of simplicity when compared with the Gothic buildings that were to follow . The style can be identified right across Europe , despite regional characteristics and different materials . Many castles were built during this period , but they are greatly outnumbered by churches . The most significant are the great abbey churches , many of which are still standing , more or less complete and frequently in use . The enormous quantity of churches built in the Romanesque period was succeeded by the still busier period of Gothic architecture , which partly or entirely rebuilt most Romanesque churches in prosperous areas like England and Portugal . The largest groups of Romanesque survivors are in areas that were less prosperous in subsequent periods , including parts of southern France , rural Spain and rural Italy ."
