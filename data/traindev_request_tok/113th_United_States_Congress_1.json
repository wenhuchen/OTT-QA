Primary runoffs , if needed , were scheduled for July 15 but proved unnecessary , because the only primary winner won more than 40 percent of the vote . According to politician Gerry Cohen , the primary was the first special primary election in North Carolina history , because in previous special elections , committees or conventions of party leaders selected their nominees . The winner of the special election would serve through the remaining months of the 113th Congress , while the winner of the regular general election being held the same day would serve in the 114th Congress . This is essentially the same procedure used in North Carolina in 1992 to fill the vacancy in the First Congressional District ( other than the addition of a primary election ) . Because Watt resigned in January and the winner of the special election was not seated until after the November election result is official , the district was without a representative for more than 11 months .",
