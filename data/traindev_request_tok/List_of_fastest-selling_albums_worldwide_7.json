  "/wiki/25_(Adele_album)": "25 is the third studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele , released on 20 November 2015 by XL Recordings and Columbia Records . Issued nearly five years after her previous album , the internationally successful 21 ( 2011 ) , the album is titled as a reflection of her life and frame of mind at 25 years old and is termed a make-up record . Its lyrical content features themes of Adele yearning for her old self , her nostalgia , and melancholia about the passage of time according to an interview with the singer by Rolling Stone , as well as themes of motherhood and regret . In contrast to Adele 's previous works , the production of 25 incorporated the use of electronic elements and creative rhythmic patterns , with elements of 1980s R & B and organs . Like when recording 21 , Adele worked with producer and songwriter Paul Epworth and Ryan Tedder , along with new collaborations with Max Martin and Shellback , Greg Kurstin , Danger Mouse , the Smeezingtons , Samuel Dixon , and Tobias Jesso Jr . Upon its release , 25 received generally positive reviews from critics , who commended Adele 's vocal performance and the album 's production . It was a massive commercial success , debuting at number one in 32 countries and breaking first-week sales records in multiple countries , including the United Kingdom and United States . In the US , the album sold over 3.38 million copies in its first week of sales , marking the largest single-week sales for an album since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking point-of-sale music purchases in 1991 . 25 eventually became the world 's best-selling album of the year for 2015 , with 17.4 million copies sold within the year , and has gone on to sell over 22 million copies worldwide , making it one of the best-selling albums of all time , and the sixth-best selling album of the 21st century . Following 21 , it was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , denoting equivalent sales of 10 million copies in the US , making Adele the only artist of the 2010s to achieve this certification with two albums . Globally , 25 was the biggest-selling music release in 2015 and 2016 , with many journalists crediting it with impacting the music industry by encouraging a renewed interest in buying physical releases rather than downloading or streaming ; much like 21 , it was also credited for saving the dwindling sales of the UK and US music industry . 25 received the BRIT Award for British Album of the Year , while its lead single Hello won British Single of the Year at the 2016 Brit Awards .",

With a line-up comprising John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they are regarded as the most influential band of all time . The group were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music 's recognition as an art form . Rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways ; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock . As pioneers in recording , songwriting and artistic presentation , the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era 's youth and sociocultural movements . Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960 , initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass . The core trio of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , together since 1958 , went through a succession of drummers , including Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them in 1962 . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit , Love Me Do , in late 1962 . As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed Beatlemania , the band acquired the nickname the Fab Four , with Epstein , Martin and other members of the band 's entourage sometimes given the informal title of fifth Beatle . By early 1964 , the Beatles were international stars , leading the British Invasion of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records . They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day 's Night ( 1964 ) . From 1965 onwards , they produced increasingly innovative recordings , including the albums Rubber Soul ( 1965 ) , Revolver ( 1966 ) and Sgt .",
