  "/wiki/Nurse": "Nursing is a profession within the health care sector focused on the care of individuals , families , and communities so they may attain , maintain , or recover optimal health and quality of life . Nurses may be differentiated from other health care providers by their approach to patient care , training , and scope of practice . Nurses practice in many specialties with differing levels of prescription authority . Many nurses provide care within the ordering scope of physicians , and this traditional role has shaped the public image of nurses as care providers . However , nurse practitioners are permitted by most jurisdictions to practice independently in a variety of settings . Since the postwar period , nurse education has undergone a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials , and many of the traditional regulations and provider roles are changing . Nurses develop a plan of care , working collaboratively with physicians , therapists , the patient , the patient 's family , and other team members that focuses on treating illness to improve quality of life . In the United States and the United Kingdom , advanced practice nurses , such as clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners , diagnose health problems and prescribe medications and other therapies , depending on individual state regulations . Nurses may help coordinate the patient care performed by other members of a multidisciplinary health care team such as therapists , medical practitioners , and dietitians . Nurses provide care both interdependently , for example , with physicians , and independently as nursing professionals .",

  "/wiki/Corporal": "Corporal is a military rank in use in some form by many militaries and by some police forces or other uniformed organizations . Within NATO , each member nation 's corresponding military rank of corporal is combined under the NATO-standard rank scale code OR-3 or OR-4 . However , there are often differences in how each nation ( or service in each nation ) employs corporals . Some militaries do n't have corporals , but may instead have a Junior Sergeant . In some militaries , the rank of corporal nominally corresponds to commanding a section or squad of soldiers . However , in the United States Army , the rank of corporal is considered a lateral promotion from E-4 Specialist and usually only occurs when the soldier has been selected by a promotion board to become an E-5 Sergeant and is serving in an E-5 billet such as a fireteam leader in a rifle squad . The lateral promotion is used to make the soldier a non-commissioned officer without changing the soldier 's pay . As the Table of Organization & Equipment ( TO & E ) rank of a fire team leader is sergeant and that of squad leader is staff sergeant . In the United States Marine Corps , corporal is the Table of Organization ( TO ) rank for a rifle fire team leader , machine gun team leader , light mortar squad leader , and assault weapon squad leader , as well as gunner on most larger crew served weapons ( i.e . medium mortars , heavy machine guns , and anti-tank missiles ) , armored vehicles ( e.g . tanks , light armored vehicles , and armored assault vehicles ) , and the two assistant gunners on a howitzer ( the gunner is a sergeant ) .

The alternative spelling , serjeant , is used in The Rifles and other units that draw their heritage from the British Light Infantry . Its origin is the Latin serviens , 'one who serves ' , through the French term sergent . The term sergeant refers to a non-commissioned officer placed above the rank of a corporal and a police officer immediately below a lieutenant or , in the UK Police forces , below an inspector . In most armies the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a squad ( or section ) . In Commonwealth armies , it is a more senior rank , corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command . In the United States Army , sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a four-soldier fireteam leader . More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant , for example staff sergeant , first sergeant , and sergeant major . Many countries use sergeant rank , whether in English or using a cognate with the same origin in another language .
