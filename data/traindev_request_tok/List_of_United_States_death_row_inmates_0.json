Rachel 's body was found in Oxford Lake , weighted down by cinder blocks . Shannon remains missing , but is presumed deceased . Gabrion is also the prime suspect in the disappearances and murders of several other people , including a witness who was set to testify against him in the trial for rape , his handyman , another potential witness and family friend and an unknown man .

The case received national attention both for the brutality of the crime and for the controversial sentence . Michigan abolished the death penalty in 1846 , but the body of Timmerman was found within the Huron-Manistee National Forests , a federally-maintained forest , which is not within the legal jurisdiction of the State of Michigan , but is directly subject to U.S. federal law - which does authorize the death penalty .

Almost 95% of the park is designated wilderness . On average , about four million people visit Yosemite each year , and most spend the majority of their time in the seven square miles ( 18 km2 ) of Yosemite Valley . The park set a visitation record in 2016 , surpassing five million visitors for the first time in its history . Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea . Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development , ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln 's signing the Yosemite Grant in 1864 . John Muir led a successful movement to have Congress establish a larger national park by 1890 , one which encompassed the valley and its surrounding mountains and forests , paving the way for the National Park System . Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada , and the park supports a diversity of plants and animals . The park has an elevation range from 2,127 to 13,114 feet ( 648 to 3,997 m ) and contains five major vegetation zones : chaparral and oak woodland , lower montane forest , upper montane forest , subalpine zone , and alpine .

Worldwide , rape is primarily committed by males against females . Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows , and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape . Widespread and systematic rape ( e.g. , war rape ) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict . These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes . Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a targeted ethnic group .

Non-criminal actions that are motivated by these reasons are often called bias incidents .

Incidents may involve physical assault , damage to property , bullying , harassment , verbal abuse or insults , mate crime or offensive graffiti or letters ( hate mail ) . A hate crime law is a law intended to deter bias-motivated violence . Hate crime laws are distinct from laws against hate speech : hate crime laws enhance the penalties associated with conduct which is already criminal under other laws , while hate speech laws criminalize a category of speech . Hate speech laws exist in many countries . In the United States , hate speech laws have been upheld by both the Supreme Court and lower courts , especially in the case of 'fighting ' words and other violent speech , but are thought by some to be in conflict with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech .

  "/wiki/White_supremacy": "White supremacy or white supremacism is the racist belief that white people are superior to people of other races and therefore should be dominant over them . White supremacy has roots in the now-discredited doctrine of scientific racism and often relies on pseudoscientific arguments .

The term is also used to describe a political ideology that perpetuates and maintains the social , political , historical , or institutional domination by white people ( as evidenced by historical and contemporary sociopolitical structures such as the Atlantic slave trade , Jim Crow laws in the United States , the set of White Australia policies from the 1890s until the mid-1970s , and apartheid in South Africa ) . Different forms of white supremacism put forth different conceptions of who is considered white , and different groups of white supremacists identify various racial and cultural groups as their primary enemy . In academic usage , particularly in usage which draws on critical race theory or intersectionality , the term white supremacy can also refer to a political or socioeconomic system , in which white people enjoy a structural advantage ( privilege ) over other ethnic groups , on both a collective and individual level .",

  "/wiki/Firebombing": "Firebombing is a bombing technique designed to damage a target , generally an urban area , through the use of fire , caused by incendiary devices , rather than from the blast effect of large bombs . In popular usage , any act in which an incendiary device is used to initiate a fire is often described as a firebombing . This article is concerned with aerial incendiary bombing as a military tactic ; for non-military ( almost always criminal ) acts , see arson . Although simple incendiary bombs have been used to destroy buildings since the start of gunpowder warfare , World War I saw the first use of strategic bombing from the air to damage the morale and economy of the enemy , such as the German Zeppelin air raids conducted on London during the Great War . The Chinese wartime capital of Chongqing was firebombed by the Imperial Japanese starting in early 1939 . London , Coventry , and many other British cities were firebombed during the Blitz by Nazi Germany . Most large German cities were extensively firebombed starting in 1942 , and almost all large Japanese cities were firebombed during the last six months of World War II . This technique makes use of small incendiary bombs ( possibly delivered by a cluster bomb such as the Molotov bread basket ) . If a fire catches , it could spread , taking in adjacent buildings that would have been largely unaffected by a high explosive bomb . This is a more effective use of the payload that a bomber could carry . The use of incendiaries alone does not generally start uncontrollable fires where the targets are roofed with nonflammable materials such as tiles or slates . The use of a mixture of bombers carrying high explosive bombs , such as the British blockbuster bombs , which blew out windows and roofs and exposed the interior of buildings to the incendiary bombs , is much more effective .",

  "/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombing": "During the annual Boston Marathon on April 15 , 2013 , two homemade pressure cooker bombs detonated 14 seconds and 210 yards ( 190 m ) apart at 2:49 p.m. , near the finish line of the race , killing 3 people and injuring several hundred others , including 16 who lost limbs . Three days later , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) released images of two suspects , who were later identified as Chechen Kyrgyzstani-American brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev . They killed an MIT policeman , kidnapped a man in his car , and had a shootout with the police in nearby Watertown , during which two officers were severely injured , one of whom died a year later . Tamerlan was shot several times , and his brother Dzhokhar ran him over while escaping in the stolen car ; Tamerlan died soon after . An unprecedented manhunt for Dzhokhar ensued on April 19 , with thousands of law enforcement officers searching a 20-block area of Watertown ; residents of Watertown and surrounding communities were asked to stay indoors , and the transportation system and most businesses and public places closed . Around 6:00 p.m. , a Watertown resident discovered Dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his backyard . He was shot and wounded by police before being taken into custody . During questioning , Dzhokhar said that he and his brother were motivated by extremist Islamist beliefs and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups , and that he was following his brother 's lead . He said they learned to build explosive devices from the online magazine of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . He also said they had intended to travel to New York City to bomb Times Square . On April 8 , 2015 , he was convicted of 30 charges , including use of a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property resulting in death . Two months later , he was sentenced to death ."
