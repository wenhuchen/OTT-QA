Kirkcaldy has long been nicknamed the Lang Toun ( listen ( help\u00b7info ) ; Scots for long town ) in reference to the early town 's 0.9-mile ( 1.4 km ) main street , as indicated on maps from the 16th and 17th centuries . The street would finally reach a length of nearly 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) , connecting the burgh to the neighbouring settlements of Linktown , Pathhead , Sinclairtown and Gallatown , which became part of the town in 1876 . The formerly separate burgh of Dysart was also later absorbed into Kirkcaldy in 1930 under an act of Parliament . The area around Kirkcaldy has been inhabited since the Bronze Age . The first document to refer to the town is from 1075 , when Malcolm III granted the settlement to the church of Dunfermline . David I later gave the burgh to Dunfermline Abbey , which had succeeded the church : a status which was officially recognised by Robert I in 1327 . The town only gained its independence from Abbey rule when it was created a royal burgh by Charles I in 1644 . From the early 16th century , the establishment of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town 's early role as an important trading port . The town also began to develop around the salt , coal mining and nail making industries.The production of linen which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by linen manufacturer , Michael Nairn .",
