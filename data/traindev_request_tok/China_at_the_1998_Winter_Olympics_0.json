She had also already won a relay silver medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics , at the age of 19 . Her strongest event by far was always the 500 metres , where she won 3 world titles- 1995 , 1998 , and 2001 . In addition to her Olympic bronze in 2002 , she was also leading the final and on her way to a likely gold medal in 1998 before a dangerous and poorly executed passing attempt by Isabelle Charest unfortunately led to Charest and Wang both falling . Distraught Wang , despite not being injured , refused to complete her 5 laps , and ceded the bronze medal to Chun Lee Kyung , the winner of the B final . Her strong start and strength on high speed corners are what made the 500 metres Wang 's strongest event . Surprisingly her best major meet performance was at the 1995 World Championships at only 16 , where as a relative newcomer she won gold in the 500 meters and 1000 metres , and a bronze in the 1500 metres . Despite this she was narrowly defeated for the Overall points title by Chun Lee Kyung , taking silver overall . She also won silver overall at the 2001 World Championships , and a bronze overall at the 1998 World Championships . She competed in what is perhaps still to this day the strongest era ever in Chinese short track speed skating from 94-2002 due to its depth of established stars such as Wang , both Yang Yang 's ( the one born in 1976 and the one born in 1977 ) , Zhang Yanmei , and Li Yan .",
