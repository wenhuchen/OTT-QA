  "/wiki/Blue_Mounds_State_Park": "Blue Mounds State Park is a state park of Minnesota , USA , in Rock County near the town of Luverne . It protects an American bison herd which grazes on one of the state 's largest prairie remnants . The state park is named after a linear escarpment of Precambrian Sioux Quartzite bedrock , which although pink in color , is said to have appeared blueish in the distance to early settlers . Parts of the cliff are up to 100 feet ( 30 m ) high . Unusual in the surrounding prairie landscape , they are a popular site for rock climbing . The park also preserves a 1,250-foot-long ( 380 m ) line of rocks aligned by Plains Indians which marks where the sun rises and sets on the spring and fall equinoxes . It also has a small reservoir for swimming , the only lake in Rock County . The park 's interpretive center was once the home of the author Frederick Manfred . Four structures and one building in the park , built by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s , are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",

  "/wiki/New_Deal": "The New Deal was a series of programs , public work projects , financial reforms , and regulations enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1939 . It responded to needs for relief , reform , and recovery from the Great Depression . Major federal programs and agencies included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . They provided support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly . The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply . New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the 3 Rs : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels , and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional [ clarification needed ] Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and non-whites and ethnic whites . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth and liberals in support . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964 .",
  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes . Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures , including entrance gateways , hotels and lodges , park roads and bridges , visitor centers , trail shelters , informational kiosks , and even mundane maintenance and support facilities . Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",
  "/wiki/Sioux_Quartzite": "The Sioux Quartzite is a Proterozoic quartzite that is found in the region around the intersection of Minnesota , South Dakota , and Iowa , and correlates with other rock units throughout the upper midwestern and southwestern United States . It was formed by braided river deposits , and its correlative units are thought to possibly define a large sedimentary wedge that once covered the passive margin on the then-southern side of the North American craton . In human history , it provided the catlinite , or pipestone , that was used by the Plains Indians to carve ceremonial pipes . With the arrival of Europeans , it was heavily quarried for building stone , and was used in many prominent structures in Sioux Falls , South Dakota and shipped to construction sites around the Midwest . Sioux Quartzite has been and continues to be quarried in Jasper , Minnesota at the Jasper Stone Company and Quarry , which itself was posted to the National Register of Historic Places on January 5 , 1978 . Jasper , Minnesota contains many turn-of-the-century quartzite buildings , including the school , churches and several other public and private structures , mostly abandoned .",
  "/wiki/King_post": "A king post ( or king-post or kingpost ) is a central vertical post used in architectural or bridge designs , working in tension to support a beam below from a truss apex above ( whereas a crown post , though visually similar , supports items above from the beam below ) . In aircraft design a strut called a king post acts in compression , similarly to an architectural crown post . Usage in mechanical plant and marine engineering differs again , as noted below .",
  "/wiki/Truss_bridge": "A truss bridge is a bridge whose load-bearing superstructure is composed of a truss , a structure of connected elements usually forming triangular units . The connected elements ( typically straight ) may be stressed from tension , compression , or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads . The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by 19th and early 20th-century engineers . A truss bridge is economical to construct because it uses materials efficiently .",

  "/wiki/Arch_bridge": "An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch . Arch bridges work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side . A viaduct ( a long bridge ) may be made from a series of arches , although other more economical structures are typically used today .",
  "/wiki/Reinforced_concrete": "Reinforced concrete ( RC ) ( also called reinforced cement concrete or RCC ) is a composite material in which concrete 's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility . The reinforcement is usually , though not necessarily , steel reinforcing bars ( rebar ) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets . Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure . Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel , polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not . Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed ( concrete in compression , reinforcement in tension ) , so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads . In the United States , the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning . For a strong , ductile and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least :",

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
  "/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture": "The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture . The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 , which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past . Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built c. 1880-1910 , a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States . From 1910-1930 , the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant , with about 40% of U.S. homes built during this period in the Colonial Revival style . In the immediate post-war period ( c. 1950s-early 1960s ) , Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed , but in simplified form . In the present-day , many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles . While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture , Colonial Revival homes also draw , to a lesser extent , from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles . Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style , freely combining aspects from several of these prototypes . Although associated with the architectural movement , Colonial Revival also refers to historic preservation , landscape architecture and garden design , and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms . Cyril M. Harris 's American Architecture : An Illustrated Encyclopedia noted that Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes ; they tend to be larger , may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate , and often exaggerate architectural details .",
  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",
  "/wiki/Silicon_dioxide": "Silicon dioxide , also known as silica , is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula SiO2 , most commonly found in nature as quartz and in various living organisms . In many parts of the world , silica is the major constituent of sand . Silica is one of the most complex and most abundant families of materials , existing as a compound of several minerals and as synthetic product . Notable examples include fused quartz , fumed silica , silica gel , and aerogels . It is used in structural materials , microelectronics ( as an electrical insulator ) , and as components in the food and pharmaceutical industries . Inhaling finely divided crystalline silica is toxic and can lead to severe inflammation of the lung tissue , silicosis , bronchitis , lung cancer , and systemic autoimmune diseases , such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis . Inhalation of amorphous silicon dioxide , in high doses , leads to non-permanent short-term inflammation , where all effects heal .",
  "/wiki/Abrasive": "An abrasive is a material , often a mineral , that is used to shape or finish a workpiece through rubbing which leads to part of the workpiece being worn away by friction . While finishing a material often means polishing it to gain a smooth , reflective surface , the process can also involve roughening as in satin , matte or beaded finishes . In short , the ceramics which are used to cut , grind and polish other softer materials are known as abrasives . Abrasives are extremely commonplace and are used very extensively in a wide variety of industrial , domestic , and technological applications . This gives rise to a large variation in the physical and chemical composition of abrasives as well as the shape of the abrasive . Some common uses for abrasives include grinding , polishing , buffing , honing , cutting , drilling , sharpening , lapping , and sanding ( see abrasive machining ) . ( For simplicity , mineral in this article will be used loosely to refer to both minerals and mineral-like substances whether man-made or not . ) Files are not abrasives ; they remove material not by scratching or rubbing , but by the cutting action of sharp teeth which have been cut into the surface of the file , very much like those of a saw . However , diamond files are a form of coated abrasive ( as they are metal rods coated with diamond powder ) .",

  "/wiki/Italian_Villa_style": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",
  "/wiki/Carnegie_library": "A Carnegie library is a library built with money donated by Scottish-American businessman and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie .

At first , Carnegie libraries were almost exclusively in places where he had a personal connection - namely his birthplace in Scotland and the Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania area , his adopted home-town . Yet , beginning in the middle of 1899 , Carnegie substantially increased funding to libraries outside these areas . In later years few towns that requested a grant and agreed to his terms were refused . By the time the last grant was made in 1919 , there were 3,500 libraries in the United States , nearly half of them built with construction grants paid by Carnegie .",

  "/wiki/Art_Nouveau": "Art Nouveau ( /\u02cc\u0251\u02d0rt nu\u02d0\u02c8vo\u028a , \u02cc\u0251\u02d0r/ ; French : [ a\u0281 nuvo ] ) is an international style of art , architecture and applied art , especially the decorative arts , known in different languages by different names : Jugendstil in German , Stile Liberty in Italian , Modernisme in Catalan , etc . In English it is also known as the Modern Style ( not to be confused with Modernism and Modern architecture ) . The style was most popular between 1890 and 1910 . It was a reaction against the academic art , eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decoration . It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers . Other characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement , often given by asymmetry or whiplash lines , and the use of modern materials , particularly iron , glass , ceramics and later concrete , to create unusual forms and larger open spaces . One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts ( especially painting and sculpture ) and applied arts . It was most widely used in interior design , graphic arts , furniture , glass art , textiles , ceramics , jewelry and metal work . The style responded to leading 19-century theoreticians , such as French architect Eug\u00e8ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc ( 1814-1879 ) and British art critic John Ruskin ( 1819-1900 ) . In Britain , it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement . German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk ( total work of art ) that would unify the architecture , furnishings , and art in the interior in a common style , to uplift and inspire the residents . The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s , in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar , Henry van de Velde , and especially Victor Horta , whose H\u00f4tel Tassel was completed in 1893 .",
