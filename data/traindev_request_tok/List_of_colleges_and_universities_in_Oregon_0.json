  "/wiki/Portland,_Oregon": "Portland ( /\u02c8p\u0254\u02d0rtl\u0259nd/ ; PORT-l\u0259nd ) is the largest and most populous city in the U.S. state of Oregon and the seat of Multnomah County . It is a major port in the Willamette Valley region of the Pacific Northwest , at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers . As of 2018 , Portland had an estimated population of 653,115 , making it the 25th most populated city in the United States , and the second-most populous in the Pacific Northwest after Seattle . Approximately 2.4 million people live in the Portland metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) , making it the 25th most populous in the United States . Its combined statistical area ( CSA ) ranks 19th-largest with a population of around 3.2 million . Approximately 60% of Oregon 's population resides within the Portland metropolitan area . [ a ] Named after Portland , Maine , the Oregon settlement began to be populated in the 1830s near the end of the Oregon Trail . Its water access provided convenient transportation of goods , and the timber industry was a major force in the city 's early economy . At the turn of the 20th century , the city had a reputation as one of the most dangerous port cities in the world , a hub for organized crime and racketeering . After the city 's economy experienced an industrial boom during World War II , its hard-edged reputation began to dissipate . Beginning in the 1960s , Portland became noted for its growing progressive political values , earning it a reputation as a bastion of counterculture . The city operates with a commission-based government guided by a mayor and four commissioners as well as Metro , the only directly elected metropolitan planning organization in the United States .",
  "/wiki/For-profit_university": "Proprietary colleges are for-profit colleges and universities . They are operated by their owners or investors , rather than a not-for-profit institution , religious organization , or government . Because they are not funded by tax money , their long-term sustainability is dependent on the value they provide relative to the perceived value of a degree from a higher educational institution overall . The increased reliance on federal student aid funds by these for profit schools is of growing concern . Since federal student loans are typically guaranteed by the government , for-profit colleges can reap a profit from taxpayers even if students drop out after enrolling , do not complete a degree , or the degree turns out to be nearly worthless for future employment . Students can be stuck with large and unmanageable debt loads , defaulting at a significantly higher rate than students at traditional non-profit institutions . Non-profit institutions generally depend in part on academic excellence and creating graduates that succeed in their fields , while for-profit schools are often based on attracting large numbers of students with few requirements in terms of academic qualifications for entry , because federal loans are provided for good and bad students alike . Some institutions in this category are regionally accredited , while many others are not . Sometimes a proprietary college may also overlap with the sector of non-degree granting business colleges . Students should exercise caution , before enrolling , about the validity and transferability of the degrees and credits earned at proprietary colleges . If a college is not regionally accredited , its credits will probably not be accepted by other colleges , and its degrees or certificates may not be recognized by employers . Every college claims to be accredited , but except in some specific areas such as nursing , regional accreditation is by far the most important type of accreditation .",

  "/wiki/Baptist": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies .

  "/wiki/Protestant": "Protestantism is the second-largest form of Christianity with a total of 800 million to 1 billion adherents worldwide or about 37% of all Christians . [ a ] It originated with the 16th century Reformation , [ b ] a movement against what its followers perceived to be errors in the Catholic Church . Protestants reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy and sacraments , but disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist . They emphasize the priesthood of all believers , justification by faith alone ( sola fide ) rather than also by good works , and the highest authority of the Bible alone ( rather than also with sacred tradition ) in faith and morals ( sola scriptura ) . The five solae summarise basic theological differences in opposition to the Roman Catholic Church . Protestantism began in Germany [ c ] in 1517 when Martin Luther published his Ninety-five Theses as a reaction against abuses in the sale of indulgences by the Roman Catholic Church , which purported to offer the remission of the temporal punishment of sins to their purchasers . However , the term derives from the letter of protestation from German Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict of the Diet of Speyer condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical . Although there were earlier breaks and attempts to reform the Roman Catholic Church - notably by Peter Waldo , John Wycliffe , and Jan Hus - only Luther succeeded in sparking a wider , lasting , and modern movement . In the 16th century , Lutheranism spread from Germany [ d ] into Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Finland , Latvia , Estonia , and Iceland . Reformed ( or Calvinist ) denominations spread in Germany , [ e ] Hungary , the Netherlands , Scotland , Switzerland and France by reformers such as John Calvin , Huldrych Zwingli , and John Knox . The political separation of the Church of England from the pope under King Henry VIII began Anglicanism , bringing England and Wales into this broad Reformation movement .
