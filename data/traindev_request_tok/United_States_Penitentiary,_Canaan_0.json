The investigation into the conspiracy was nicknamed Operation Varsity Blues . The investigation and related charges were made public on March 12 , 2019 , by United States federal prosecutors . At least 53 people have been charged as part of the conspiracy , a number of whom have pled guilty or agreed to plead guilty . Thirty-three parents of college applicants are accused of paying more than $ 25 million between 2011 and 2018 to William Rick Singer , organizer of the scheme , who used part of the money to fraudulently inflate entrance exam test scores and bribe college officials . Singer controlled the two firms involved in the scheme , Key Worldwide Foundation and The Edge College & Career Network ( also known as The Key ) . He pled guilty and cooperated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in gathering incriminating evidence against co-conspirators .

  "/wiki/Drug_lord": "A drug lord , drug baron , kingpin or narcotrafficker is a high ranking crime boss who controls a sizable network of people involved in the illegal drug trade . Such figures are often difficult to bring to justice , as they are normally not directly in possession of something illegal , but are insulated from the actual trade in drugs by several layers of staff . The prosecution of drug lords is therefore usually the result of carefully planned infiltration into their networks , often using informants from within the organization .",

Al-Qaeda operates as a network of Islamic extremists and Salafist jihadists . The organization has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , the European Union , the United States , the United Kingdom , Russia , India , and various other countries ( see below ) . Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries , including the 1998 United States embassy bombings , the September 11 attacks , and the 2002 Bali bombings . The United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the War on Terror , which sought to undermine al-Qaeda and its allies . The deaths of key leaders , including that of Osama bin Laden , have led al-Qaeda 's operations to shift from the top down organization and planning of attacks , to the planning of attacks which are carried out by associated groups and lone-wolf operators . Al-Qaeda characteristically employs attacks which include suicide attacks and the simultaneous bombing of several targets . Activities which are ascribed to al-Qaeda involve the actions of those who have made a pledge of loyalty to bin Laden , or to the actions of al-Qaeda-linked individuals who have undergone training in one of its camps in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq or Sudan . Al-Qaeda ideologues envision the removal of all foreign influences in Muslim countries . Al-Qaeda members believe that a Christian-Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam . As Salafist jihadists , members of al-Qaeda believe that the killing of non-combatants is religiously sanctioned . This belief ignores the aspects of religious scripture which forbid the murder of non-combatants and internecine fighting .",
  "/wiki/Terrorism": "Terrorism is , in the broadest sense , the use of intentional violence for political or religious purposes . It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants ( mostly civilians and neutral military personnel ) . The terms terrorist and terrorism originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but gained mainstream popularity in the 1970s during the conflicts of Northern Ireland , the Basque Country and Palestine . The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington , D.C. in 2001 . There are different definitions of terrorism . Terrorism is a charged term . It is often used with the connotation of something that is morally wrong . Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups . Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives . These include right-wing and left-wing political organizations , nationalist groups , religious groups , revolutionaries and ruling governments . Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states . When terrorism is perpetrated by nation states , it is not considered terrorism by the state conducting it , making legality a largely grey-area issue .",
  "/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)": "In criminal law , a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime at some time in the future . Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement , to constitute an offense . There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and , in most countries , no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect ( compare attempts which require proximity to the full offense ) . For the purposes of concurrence , the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or can not be traced . Finally , repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability ( unless , in some cases , it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts ) but may reduce their sentence . An unindicted co-conspirator , or unindicted conspirator , is a person or entity that is alleged in an indictment to have engaged in conspiracy , but who is not charged in the same indictment . Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity , pragmatic considerations , and evidentiary concerns .",

  "/wiki/Piracy": "Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area , typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties . Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates . The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC , when the Sea Peoples , a group of ocean raiders , attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilizations . Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy , as well as for privateering and commerce raiding . Historic examples include the waters of Gibraltar , the Strait of Malacca , Madagascar , the Gulf of Aden , and the English Channel , whose geographic structures facilitated pirate attacks . A land-based parallel is the ambushing of travelers by bandits and brigands in highways and mountain passes . Privateering uses similar methods to piracy , but the captain acts under orders of the state authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation , making it a legitimate form of war-like activity by non-state actors . While the term can include acts committed in the air , on land ( especially across national borders or in connection with taking over and robbing a car or train ) , or in other major bodies of water or on a shore , in cyberspace , as well as the fictional possibility of space piracy , it generally refers to maritime piracy . It does not normally include crimes committed against people traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator ( e.g . one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel ) . Piracy or pirating is the name of a specific crime under customary international law and also the name of a number of crimes under the municipal law of a number of states . In the early 21st century , seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue ( with estimated worldwide losses of US $ 16 billion per year in 2004 ) , particularly in the waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean , off the Somali coast , and also in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore .",
  "/wiki/Kidnapping": "In criminal law , kidnapping is the unlawful transportation , asportation and confinement of a person against their will . Thus , it is a composite crime . It can also be defined as false imprisonment by means of abduction , both of which are separate crimes that when committed simultaneously upon the same person merge as the single crime of kidnapping . The asportation/abduction element is typically but not necessarily conducted by means of force or fear . That is , the perpetrator may use a weapon to force the victim into a vehicle , but it is still kidnapping if the victim is enticed to enter the vehicle willingly , e.g. , in the belief it is a taxicab . Kidnapping may be done to demand for ransom in exchange for releasing the victim , or for other illegal purposes . Kidnapping can be accompanied by bodily injury which elevates the crime to aggravated kidnapping . Kidnapping of a child is also known as child abduction , and these are sometimes separate legal categories .",

  "/wiki/Racket_(crime)": "A racket , according to the current common and most general definition , is an organized criminal act in which the criminal act is some form of substantial business , or a way to earn illegal money either regularly , or briefly but repeatedly . A racket is therefore generally a repeated or continuous organized criminal operation . However , according to the more specific definition , racketeering constitutes extortion or criminal coercion . Originally and often still specifically , a racket referred to a criminal act in which the perpetrator or perpetrators fraudulently offer a service that will not be put into effect , a service to solve a nonexistent problem , or to solve a problem that would not exist without the racket . Conducting a racket is racketeering . Particularly , the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it , but that fact may be concealed , with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party . The most common example of a racket is the protection racket , which promises to protect the target business or person from dangerous individuals in the neighborhood and then either collects the money or causes damage to the business until the owner pays . The racket exists as both the problem and its solution , and it is used as a method of extortion . However , the term racket has expanded in definition and may now be used less strictly to refer to any continuous or repeated illegal organized crime operation , including those that do not necessarily involve fraudulent practices . For example , racket may be used to refer to the numbers racket or the drug racket , neither of which generally involve fraud or deception with regard to the intended clientele . Racketeering is most often associated with organized crime , and the term was coined by the Employers ' Association of Chicago in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the Teamsters union .",
  "/wiki/Money_laundering": "Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions . The overall scheme of this process returns the money to the launderer in an obscure and indirect way . One problem of criminal activities is accounting for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies . Considerable time and effort may be put into strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion . Implementing such strategies is generally called money laundering . After money has been laundered , it can be used for legitimate purposes . Law enforcement agencies of many jurisdictions have set up sophisticated systems in an effort to detect suspicious transactions or activities , and many have set up international cooperative arrangements to assist each other in these endeavors . The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) estimates that The estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2-5% of global GDP , or $ 800 billion - $ 2 trillion in current US dollars . In a number of legal and regulatory systems , the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime , and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system ( involving things such as securities , digital currencies , credit cards , and traditional currency ) , including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions . Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering ( which is concerned with source of funds ) with terrorism financing ( which is concerned with destination of funds ) when regulating the financial system . Some countries treat obfuscation of sources of money as also constituting money laundering , whether it is intentional or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations . Other countries define money laundering in such a way as to include money from activity that would have been a crime in that country , even if the activity was legal where the actual conduct occurred .",
