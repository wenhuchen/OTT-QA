In the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese empires including the Iberian Peninsula it continued , together with new styles , until the first decade of the 1800s . It followed Renaissance art and Mannerism and preceded the Rococo ( in the past often referred to as late Baroque ) and Neoclassical styles . It was encouraged by the Catholic Church as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of Protestant architecture , art and music , though Lutheran Baroque art developed in parts of Europe as well . The Baroque style used contrast , movement , exuberant detail , deep colour , grandeur and surprise to achieve a sense of awe . The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome , then spread rapidly to France , northern Italy , Spain and Portugal , then to Austria , southern Germany and Russia . By the 1730s , it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style , called rocaille or Rococo , which appeared in France and Central Europe until the mid to late 18th century .",

His paintings combine a realistic observation of the human state , both physical and emotional , with a dramatic use of lighting , which had a formative influence on Baroque painting . Caravaggio employed close physical observation with a dramatic use of chiaroscuro that came to be known as tenebrism . He made the technique a dominant stylistic element , darkening shadows and transfixing subjects in bright shafts of light . Caravaggio vividly expressed crucial moments and scenes , often featuring violent struggles , torture and death . He worked rapidly , with live models , preferring to forgo drawings and work directly onto the canvas . His influence on the new Baroque style that emerged from Mannerism was profound . It can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of Peter Paul Rubens , Jusepe de Ribera , Gian Lorenzo Bernini , and Rembrandt , and artists in the following generation heavily under his influence were called the Caravaggisti or Caravagesques , as well as tenebrists or tenebrosi ( shadowists ) . Caravaggio trained as a painter in Milan before moving in his twenties to Rome . He developed a considerable name as an artist , and as a violent , touchy and provocative man . A brawl led to a death sentence for murder and forced him to flee to Naples . There he again established himself as one of the most prominent Italian painters of his generation .",

  "/wiki/Autobiographical_novel": "An autobiographical novel is a form of novel using autofiction techniques , or the merging of autobiographical and fictive elements . The literary technique is distinguished from an autobiography or memoir by the stipulation of being fiction . Because an autobiographical novel is partially fiction , the author does not ask the reader to expect the text to fulfill the autobiographical pact . Names and locations are often changed and events are recreated to make them more dramatic but the story still bears a close resemblance to that of the author 's life . While the events of the author 's life are recounted , there is no pretense of exact truth . Events may be exaggerated or altered for artistic or thematic purposes . Novels that portray settings and/or situations with which the author is familiar are not necessarily autobiographical . Neither are novels that include aspects drawn from the author 's life as minor plot details . To be considered an autobiographical novel by most standards , there must be a protagonist modeled after the author and a central plotline that mirrors events in his or her life . Novels that do not fully meet these requirements or are further distanced from true events are sometimes called semi-autobiographical novels . Many novels about intense , private experiences such as war , family conflict or sex , are written as autobiographical novels . Some works openly refer to themselves as 'nonfiction novels . '",
