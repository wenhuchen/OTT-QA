  "/wiki/Ventnor,_Isle_of_Wight": "Ventnor ( /\u02c8v\u025bntn\u0259/ ) is a seaside resort and civil parish established in the Victorian era on the south-east coast of the Isle of Wight , England , eleven miles ( 18 km ) from Newport . It is situated south of St Boniface Down , and built on steep slopes leading down to the sea . The higher part is referred to as Upper Ventnor ( officially Lowtherville ) ; the lower part , where most amenities are located , is known as Ventnor . Ventnor is sometimes taken to include the nearby and older settlements of St Lawrence and Bonchurch , which are covered by its town council . The population of the parish in 2016 was about 5,800 . Ventnor became extremely fashionable as both a health and holiday resort in the late 19th century , described as the 'English Mediterranean ' and 'Mayfair by the Sea ' . Medical advances during the early twentieth century reduced its role as a health resort and , like other British seaside resorts , its summer holiday trade suffered the changing nature of travel during the latter part of that century . Its relatively sheltered location beneath the hilly chalk downland produces a microclimate with more sunny days and fewer frosts than the rest of the island . This allows many species of subtropical plant to flourish ; Ventnor Botanic Garden is particularly notable . Ventnor retains a strongly Victorian character , has an active arts scene , and is regaining popularity as a place to visit .",
