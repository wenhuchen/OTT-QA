Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

Soyuz TMA-16 brought the final members of Expedition 21 to the ISS , along with space tourist Guy Lalibert\u00e9 . Lalibert\u00e9 returned to Earth on Soyuz TMA-14 with two members of Expedition 20 on 11 October 2009 . Nicole P. Stott was the last ISS expedition crew member to fly on the Space Shuttle . She returned to Earth aboard STS-129 in November 2009 .",
  "/wiki/STS-128": "STS-128 ( ISS assembly flight 17A ) was a NASA Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station ( ISS ) that launched on 28 August 2009 . Space Shuttle Discovery carried the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module Leonardo as its primary payload . Leonardo contained a collection of experiments for studying the physics and chemistry of microgravity . Three spacewalks were carried out during the mission , which removed and replaced a materials processing experiment outside ESA 's Columbus module , and returned an empty ammonia tank assembly . The mission 's first launch attempt was delayed due to weather concerns , including multiple weather violations in NASA 's launch rules , beginning over two hours before the scheduled launch . The second launch attempt , scheduled for 26 August 2009 at 01:10:22 EDT , was called off the previous evening due to an anomaly in one of the orbiter 's fuel valves . The launch finally took place on 28 August 2009 at 23:59 EDT . Discovery landed on 11 September 2009 at Edwards Air Force Base , which was the last landing of a shuttle to occur at the California site .",

This flight delivered the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer and an ExPRESS Logistics Carrier to the International Space Station . Mark Kelly served as the mission commander . STS-134 was expected to be the final space shuttle mission if STS-135 did not receive funding from Congress . However , in February 2011 , NASA stated that STS-135 would fly regardless of the funding situation . STS-135 , flown by Atlantis , took advantage of the processing for STS-335 , the Launch On Need mission that would have been necessary if the STS-134 crew became stranded in orbit . Changes in the design of the main payload , AMS-02 , as well as delays to STS-133 , led to delays in the mission . The first launch attempt on 29 April 2011 was scrubbed at 12:20 pm by launch managers due to problems with two heaters on one of the orbiter 's auxiliary power units ( APU ) .
