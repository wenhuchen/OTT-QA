  "/wiki/Battle_of_Buffington_Island": "The Battle of Buffington Island , also known as the St. Georges Creek Skirmish , was an American Civil War engagement in Meigs County , Ohio , and Jackson County , West Virginia , on July 19 , 1863 , during Morgan 's Raid . The largest battle in Ohio during the war , Buffington Island contributed to the capture of the famed Confederate cavalry raider , Brig . Gen. John H. Morgan , who was seeking to escape Union army pursuers across the Ohio River at a ford opposite Buffington Island . Delayed overnight , Morgan was almost surrounded by Union cavalry the next day , and the resulting battle ended in a Confederate rout , with over half of the 1,700-man Confederate force being captured . General Morgan and some 700 men escaped , but the daring raid finally ended on July 26 with his surrender after the Battle of Salineville . Morgan 's Raid was of little military consequence , but it did spread terror among much of the population of southern and eastern Ohio , as well as neighboring Indiana .",

  "/wiki/William_H._Grant_House_(Middleport,_Ohio)": "The William H. Grant House is a historic house in Middleport , Ohio , United States . One of the area 's earliest concrete houses , it has been designated a historic site . Built in 1852 , the house is constructed of concrete on a foundation of sandstone . Two stories tall , the house is rectangular with a small frame addition to the rear , which was built about ten years after the original part of the house . Born in 1820 , William H. Grant pioneered concrete architecture in Meigs County : a small experimental house ( no longer in existence ) was the first concrete building in the county , and the present house , near the experimental building , was the second . Besides serving as a residence , the house is a local religious landmark . Before dying in 1845 , Johnny Appleseed visited Middleport and converted the Grants to Swedenborgianism . Several other Middleport residents also joined the new religion , and after building the present house , the Grants used it as a meeting place for their coreligionists . In recognition of its place in local history and its distinctive method of construction , the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 .

The construction dates of some elements of the grounds are unknown , but the present sharply-curved racetrack was finished in 1889 or earlier . In 1890 , donations by average citizens paid for the construction of a grandstand by the track to supplement a nearby hillside where fairgoers had previously sat . Instead of being placed simply along one side of the track , the grandstand curves around the northeastern turn of the track ; it is the only curved grandstand at an Ohio county fairgrounds . In 1982 , much of the fairgrounds , including the racetrack and grandstand , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

  "/wiki/Middleport_Public_Library": "The Middleport Public Library is a historic Carnegie library in the Ohio River village of Middleport , Ohio , United States . Built in the early twentieth century , it has been named a historic site . Middleport was founded as Sheffield during the 1820s , a time of great prosperity and rapidly increasing commerce in Meigs County . Among its earliest industries was a cotton mill , built despite the lack of cotton production in the vicinity . Local residents formed the village 's first public library in 1908 , but its initial location on the second floor of a commercial building soon proved unsatisfactory . One year later , the library 's board contacted Andrew Carnegie 's Carnegie Corporation in order to begin participating in its library construction program . Negotiations ultimately resulted in the foundation agreeing to provide the village with construction money , and the building was completed in 1912 under the direction of Athens contractor Charles Kirchner . The Middleport library is a brick building with a tiled roof and a brick foundation . Its architecture is generally simple , although some details of the facade display a Georgian Revival architectural flavor ; some of the more ornate examples are the pediment above the portico , the quoins , and the dentils underneath the pediment and the cornice . In January 1986 , the library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places . It qualified for inclusion under two different criteria : its architecture , which makes the library Middleport 's most distinctive public building , and for its place in local history - besides its status as an example of small-town Carnegie libraries , it remained an icon of Middleport 's early twentieth-century community activities . The library is one of three Middleport locations on the National Register , along with the John Downing Jr. House and the William H. Grant House .",
  "/wiki/Carnegie_library": "A Carnegie library is a library built with money donated by Scottish-American businessman and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie . A total of 2,509 Carnegie libraries were built between 1883 and 1929 , including some belonging to public and university library systems . 1,689 were built in the United States , 660 in the United Kingdom and Ireland , 125 in Canada , and others in Australia , South Africa , New Zealand , Serbia , Belgium , France , the Caribbean , Mauritius , Malaysia , and Fiji . At first , Carnegie libraries were almost exclusively in places where he had a personal connection - namely his birthplace in Scotland and the Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania area , his adopted home-town . Yet , beginning in the middle of 1899 , Carnegie substantially increased funding to libraries outside these areas . In later years few towns that requested a grant and agreed to his terms were refused . By the time the last grant was made in 1919 , there were 3,500 libraries in the United States , nearly half of them built with construction grants paid by Carnegie .",
  "/wiki/Mound_Cemetery_Mound_(Chester,_Ohio)": "The Mound Cemetery Mound is a Native American mound in central Meigs County , Ohio , United States . Located in the eponymous Mound Cemetery , the mound lies north of the community of Chester in Chester Township . Because the mound has never been excavated , it remains in fine condition . Its location near the Middle Branch of the Shade River suggests that it was built by the Adena people ; if so , it can be expected to contain remnants of a wooden structure that served as the burial place for a prominent member of Adena society . Many burial mounds existed in present-day Meigs County when the area was first settled , but many succumbed to the shovels of curious settlers who hoped to find treasures within . Some of these mounds yielded artifacts such as stone tools , pottery , and skeletons when opened . Other mounds were gradually destroyed by the plows of farmers cultivating their fields for many years . The remains of what may have once been another mound and related earthworks can be found in the near vicinity of Mound Cemetery . Another Adena mound , known as the Reeves Mound , is located in northern Meigs County north of the community of Alfred . Unlike the mound remnants near the cemetery , the Mound Cemetery Mound and the Reeves Mound are listed on the National Register of Historic Places ; both were added to the Register in 1974 .",

Located north of the unincorporated community of Alfred , the mound is an archaeological site that appears to have been built by peoples of the Adena culture . Located in a farm field , the Reeves Mound is an oval 3.3 feet ( 1.0 m ) high ; it measures approximately 42 feet ( 13 m ) from east to west and approximately 45 feet ( 14 m ) from north to south . The fields around the mound have yielded stone chips and projectile points that are characteristic of the Adena culture . Among these points is one of the distinctive form known as a bird point . It appears that the Adena used the mound and its surrounding area for hundreds of years ; some of the points are typical of the early years of the Adena culture , which dates from circa 1000 BC , while others appear to date from the culture 's late period , circa 400 AD .
