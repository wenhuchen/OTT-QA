The atoll 's inhabitants were relocated in 1946 , after which the islands and lagoon were the site of 23 nuclear tests by the United States until 1958 . The atoll is at the northern end of the Ralik Chain , approximately 850 kilometres ( 530 mi ) northwest of the capital Majuro . Three families were resettled on Bikini island in 1970 , totaling about 100 residents . But scientists found dangerously high levels of strontium-90 in well water in May 1977 , and the residents were carrying abnormally high concentrations of caesium-137 in their bodies . They were evacuated in 1980 . The atoll is occasionally visited today by divers and a few scientists , and is occupied by a handful of caretakers .",
