  "/wiki/United_States_Army": "The United States Army ( USA ) is the land warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces . It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services , and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution . As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence , the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army , which was formed ( 14 June 1775 ) to fight the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) - before the United States of America was established as a country . After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775 . As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It is the largest military branch , and in the fiscal year 2017 , the projected end strength for the Regular Army ( USA ) was 476,000 soldiers ; the Army National Guard ( ARNG ) had 343,000 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve ( USAR ) had 199,000 soldiers ; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers . As a branch of the armed forces , the mission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation 's wars , by providing prompt , sustained land dominance , across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict , in support of combatant commanders . The branch participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force of the United States .",
  "/wiki/Republic_of_Vietnam": "South Vietnam , officially the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN ; Vietnamese : Vi\u1ec7t Nam C\u1ed9ng H\u00f2a ; French : R\u00e9publique du Vi\u00eat Nam ) , was a country that existed from 1955 to 1975 , the period when the southern portion of Vietnam was a member of the Western Bloc during part of the Cold War . It received international recognition in 1949 as the State of Vietnam ( a self-governing entity in the French Empire ) , which was a constitutional monarchy ( 1949-1955 ) . The country was renamed the Republic of Vietnam in 1955 . Its capital was Saigon ( now Ho Chi Minh City ) . South Vietnam was bordered by North Vietnam to the north , Laos to the northwest , Cambodia to the southwest , Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest , and the Philippines , Malaysia , Brunei , and Indonesia across the South China Sea to the east and southeast . The Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed on 26 October 1955 , with Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m as its first president , after having briefly served as premier under Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i who was exiled . Its sovereignty was recognized by the United States and 87 other nations . It had membership in several special committees of the United Nations , but its application for full membership was rejected in 1957 because of a Soviet veto ( neither South nor North Vietnam were members of the UN during the Vietnam War , but the united Vietnam became a member state in 1977 ) . South Vietnam 's origins can be traced to the French colony of Cochinchina , which consisted of the southern third of Vietnam which was Cochinchina [ Nam K\u1ef3 ] , a subdivision of French Indochina , and the southern half of Central Vietnam or Annam [ Trung K\u1ef3 ] which was a French protectorate . After the Second World War , the anti-Japanese Vi\u1ec7t Minh guerrilla forces , led by Ho Chi Minh , proclaimed the establishment of a Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Hanoi in September 1945 , issuing a Declaration of Independence modeled on the US one from 1776 . In 1949 , anti-communist Vietnamese politicians formed a rival government in Saigon led by former emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i . B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in 1955 , who proclaimed himself president after a referendum .",

The alternative spelling , serjeant , is used in The Rifles and other units that draw their heritage from the British Light Infantry . Its origin is the Latin serviens , 'one who serves ' , through the French term sergent . The term sergeant refers to a non-commissioned officer placed above the rank of a corporal and a police officer immediately below a lieutenant or , in the UK Police forces , below an inspector . In most armies the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a squad ( or section ) . In Commonwealth armies , it is a more senior rank , corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command . In the United States Army , sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a four-soldier fireteam leader . More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant , for example staff sergeant , first sergeant , and sergeant major . Many countries use sergeant rank , whether in English or using a cognate with the same origin in another language . The equivalent rank in Arab armies is raq\u012bb ( \u0631\u0642\u064a\u0628 ) , meaning 'overseer ' or 'watcher ' .",
