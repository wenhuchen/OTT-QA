  "/wiki/Linux_kernel": "The Linux kernel is a free and open-source , monolithic , Unix-like operating system kernel . The Linux family of operating systems is based on this kernel and deployed on both traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers , usually in the form of Linux distributions , and on various embedded devices such as routers , wireless access points , PBXes , set-top boxes , FTA receivers , smart TVs , PVRs , and NAS appliances . While the adoption of the Linux kernel in desktop computer operating system is low , Linux-based operating systems dominate nearly every other segment of computing , from mobile devices to mainframes . Since November 2017 [ update ] , all of the world 's 500 most powerful supercomputers run Linux . The Android operating system for tablet computers , smartphones , and smartwatches also uses the Linux kernel . The Linux kernel was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his personal computer and with no cross-platform intentions , but has since expanded to support a huge array of computer architectures , many more than other kernels do . Linux rapidly attracted developers and users who adopted it as the kernel for other free software projects , notably the GNU Operating System , which was created as a free , non-proprietary operating system , and based on UNIX as a by-product of the fallout of the Unix wars . The Linux kernel API , the application programming interface ( API ) through which user programs interact with the kernel , is meant to be very stable and to not break userspace programs ( some programs , such as those with GUIs , rely on other APIs as well ) . As part of the kernel 's functionality , device drivers control the hardware ; mainlined ( included in the kernel ) device drivers are also meant to be very stable . However , the interface between the kernel and loadable kernel modules ( LKMs ) , unlike in many other kernels and operating systems , is not meant to be very stable by design . The Linux kernel , developed by contributors worldwide , is a prominent example of free and open source software . Day-to-day development discussions take place on the Linux kernel mailing list ( LKML ) .",
  "/wiki/File_system": "In computing , a file system or filesystem ( often abbreviated to fs ) , controls how data is stored and retrieved . Without a file system , data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins . By separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name , the data is easily isolated and identified . Taking its name from the way paper-based data management system is named , each group of data is called a file . The structure and logic rules used to manage the groups of data and their names is called a file system . There are many different kinds of file systems . Each one has different structure and logic , properties of speed , flexibility , security , size and more . Some file systems have been designed to be used for specific applications . For example , the ISO 9660 file system is designed specifically for optical discs . File systems can be used on numerous different types of storage devices that use different kinds of media . As of 2019 , hard disk drives have been key storage devices and are projected to remain so for the foreseeable future . Other kinds of media that are used include SSDs , magnetic tapes , and optical discs .",
  "/wiki/Init": "In Unix-based computer operating systems , init ( short for initialization ) is the first process started during booting of the computer system . Init is a daemon process that continues running until the system is shut down . It is the direct or indirect ancestor of all other processes and automatically adopts all orphaned processes . Init is started by the kernel during the booting process ; a kernel panic will occur if the kernel is unable to start it . Init is typically assigned process identifier 1 . In Unix systems such as System III and System V , the design of init has diverged from the functionality provided by the init in Research Unix and its BSD derivatives . Up until recently , most Linux distributions employed a traditional init that is somewhat compatible with System V , while some distributions such as Slackware use BSD-style startup scripts , and others such as Gentoo have their own customized versions . Since then , several additional init implementations have been created , attempting to address design limitations in the traditional versions . These include launchd , the Service Management Facility , systemd and OpenRC .",
  "/wiki/Desktop_environment": "In computing , a desktop environment ( DE ) is an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of programs running on top of a computer operating system , which share a common graphical user interface ( GUI ) , sometimes described as a graphical shell . The desktop environment was seen mostly on personal computers until the rise of mobile computing . Desktop GUIs help the user to easily access and edit files , while they usually do not provide access to all of the features found in the underlying operating system . Instead , the traditional command-line interface ( CLI ) is still used when full control over the operating system is required . A desktop environment typically consists of icons , windows , toolbars , folders , wallpapers and desktop widgets ( see Elements of graphical user interfaces and WIMP ) . A GUI might also provide drag and drop functionality and other features that make the desktop metaphor more complete . A desktop environment aims to be an intuitive way for the user to interact with the computer using concepts which are similar to those used when interacting with the physical world , such as buttons and windows . While the term desktop environment originally described a style of user interfaces following the desktop metaphor , it has also come to describe the programs that realize the metaphor itself . This usage has been popularized by projects such as the Common Desktop Environment , K Desktop Environment , and GNOME .",
  "/wiki/Window_manager": "A window manager is a system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface . Most window managers are designed to help provide a desktop environment . They work in conjunction with the underlying graphical system that provides required functionality - support for graphics hardware , pointing devices , and a keyboard , and are often written and created using a widget toolkit . Few window managers are designed with a clear distinction between the windowing system and the window manager . Every graphical user interface based on a windows metaphor has some form of window management . In practice , the elements of this functionality vary greatly . Elements usually associated with window managers allow the user to open , close , minimize , maximize , move , resize , and keep track of running windows , including window decorators . Many window managers also come with various utilities and features : e.g . docks , task bars , program launchers , desktop icons , and wallpaper .",

The name systemd adheres to the Unix convention of naming daemons by appending the letter d. It also plays on the term System D , which refers to a person 's ability to adapt quickly and improvise to solve problems . Since 2015 , the majority of Linux distributions have adopted systemd , having replaced other systems such as the UNIX System V and BSD init systems . systemd has faced mixed reception from Linux users , with arguments that systemd suffers from mission creep and bloat , as well as criticism over software ( such as the GNOME desktop ) adding dependencies on systemd - frustrating compatibility with other Unix-like operating systems .",

Cinnamon is the principal desktop environment of the Linux Mint distribution and is available as an optional desktop for other Linux distributions and other Unix-like operating systems as well . The development of Cinnamon began as a reaction to the April 2011 release of GNOME 3 in which the conventional desktop metaphor of GNOME 2 was abandoned in favor of GNOME Shell . Following several attempts to extend GNOME 3 such that it would suit the Linux Mint design goals , the Mint developers forked several GNOME 3 components to build an independent desktop environment . Separation from GNOME was completed in Cinnamon 2.0 , which was released in October 2013 . Applets and desklets are no longer compatible with GNOME 3 . As the distinguishing factor of Linux Mint , Cinnamon has generally received favorable coverage by the press , in particular for its ease-of-use and gentle learning curve .
