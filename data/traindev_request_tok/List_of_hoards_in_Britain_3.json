It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present . [ a ] It was the first public national museum in the world . The British Museum was established in 1753 , largely based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane . It first opened to the public in 1759 , in Montagu House , on the site of the current building . Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions , the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881 . In 1973 , the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum , but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997 . The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital , Culture , Media and Sport , and as with all national museums in the UK it charges no admission fee , except for loan exhibitions . Its ownership of some of its most famous objects originating in other countries is disputed and remains the subject of international controversy , most notably in the case of the Parthenon Marbles .",

  "/wiki/Lead": "Lead ( /\u02c8l\u025bd/ ) is a chemical element with the symbol Pb ( from the Latin plumbum ) and atomic number 82 . It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials . Lead is soft and malleable , and also has a relatively low melting point . When freshly cut , lead is silvery with a hint of blue ; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air . Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and three of its isotopes are endpoints of major nuclear decay chains of heavier elements . Lead is a relatively unreactive post-transition metal . Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature ; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases , and it tends to form covalent bonds . Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group . Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds . Like the lighter members of the group , lead tends to bond with itself ; it can form chains and polyhedral structures . Lead is easily extracted from its ores ; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it . Galena , a principal ore of lead , often bears silver , interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in ancient Rome .",

Yet after the deaths of his heirs within a decade of his own , and the Norman conquest of England in 1066 , this legacy was lost . He is popularly invoked in the context of the legend of King Canute and the tide , which often misrepresents him as a deluded monarch believing he has supernatural powers , contrary to the original legend which portrays a wise king who rebuked his courtiers for their fawning behaviour . As a Danish prince , Cnut won the throne of England in 1016 in the wake of centuries of Viking activity in northwestern Europe . Scotland submitted to him in 1017 . His later accession to the Danish throne in 1018 brought the crowns of England and Denmark together . Cnut sought to keep this power-base by uniting Danes and English under cultural bonds of wealth and custom , as well as through sheer brutality . After a decade of conflict with opponents in Scandinavia , Cnut claimed the crown of Norway in Trondheim in 1028 . The Swedish city Sigtuna was held by Cnut ( he had coins struck there that called him king , but there is no narrative record of his occupation ) . Dominion of England lent the Danes an important link to the maritime zone between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland , where Cnut , like his father before him , had a strong interest and wielded much influence among the Norse-Gaels . Cnut 's possession of England 's dioceses and the continental Diocese of Denmark - with a claim laid upon it by the Holy Roman Empire 's Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen - was a source of great prestige and leverage within the Catholic Church and among the magnates of Christendom ( gaining notable concessions such as one on the price of the pallium of his bishops , though they still had to travel to obtain the pallium , as well as on the tolls his people had to pay on the way to Rome ) . After his 1026 victory against Norway and Sweden , and on his way back from Rome where he attended the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor , Cnut , in a letter written for the benefit of his subjects , deemed himself King of all England and Denmark and the Norwegians and of some of the Swedes .",

Natives of Barrow , as well as the local dialect , are known as Barrovian . In the Middle Ages , Barrow was a small hamlet within the parish of Dalton-in-Furness with Furness Abbey , now on the outskirts of the modern-day town , controlling the local economy before its dissolution in 1537 . The iron prospector Henry Schneider arrived in Furness in 1839 and , with other investors , opened the Furness Railway in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast . Further hematite deposits were discovered , of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel . For a period of the late 19th century , the Barrow Hematite Steel Company-owned steelworks was the world 's largest . Barrow 's location and the availability of steel allowed the town to develop into a significant producer of naval vessels , a shift that was accelerated during World War I and the local yard 's specialisation in submarines . The original iron- and steel-making enterprises closed down after World War II , leaving Vickers shipyard as Barrow 's main industry and employer .

  "/wiki/Carolingian": "The Carolingian dynasty ( known variously as the Carlovingians , Carolingus , Carolings , Karolinger or Karlings ) was a Frankish noble family founded by Charles Martel with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD . The dynasty consolidated its power in the 8th century , eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and dux et princeps Francorum hereditary , and becoming the de facto rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the Merovingian throne . In 751 the Merovingian dynasty which had ruled the Germanic Franks was overthrown with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy , and Pepin the Short , son of Martel , was crowned King of the Franks . The Carolingian dynasty reached its peak in 800 with the crowning of Charlemagne as the first Emperor of Romans in the West in over three centuries . His death in 814 began an extended period of fragmentation of the Carolingian Empire and decline that would eventually lead to the evolution of the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire .",

  "/wiki/Huxley_Hoard": "The Huxley Hoard is a hoard of Viking jewellery from around 900-910 found buried near Huxley , Cheshire , England . It consists of 21 silver bracelets , one silver ingot , and 39 lead fragments , weighing around 1.5 kilograms ( 3.3 lb ) in total . The bracelets might have been produced by Norse settlers in Dublin and possibly buried for safekeeping by Viking refugees settling in Cheshire and the Wirral in the early 900 's .

  "/wiki/Penannular_brooches": "The Celtic brooch , more properly called the penannular brooch , and its closely related type , the pseudo-penannular brooch , are types of brooch clothes fasteners , often rather large ; penannular means formed as an incomplete ring . They are especially associated with the beginning of the Early Medieval period in the British Isles , although they are found in other times and places - for example , forming part of traditional female dress in areas in modern North Africa . Beginning as utilitarian fasteners in the Iron Age and Roman period , they are especially associated with the highly ornate brooches produced in precious metal for the elites of Ireland and Scotland from about 700 to 900 , which are popularly known as Celtic brooches or similar terms . They are the most significant objects in high-quality secular metalwork from Early Medieval Celtic art , or Insular art , as art historians prefer to call it . The type continued in simpler forms such as the thistle brooch into the 11th century , during what is often known as the Viking Age in Ireland and Scotland . Both penannular and pseudo-penannular brooches feature a long pin attached by its head to a ring ; the pin can move freely around the ring as far as the terminals , which are close together . In the true penannular type , the ring is not closed ; there is a gap between the terminals wide enough for the pin to pass through . In the pseudo-penannular type , the ring is closed , but there are still two separately defined terminals , which are joined by a further element . The penannular type is a simple and efficient way of fastening loosely woven cloth ( where the pin will not leave a permanent hole ) , but the pseudo-penannular type is notably less efficient . The brooches were worn by both men and women , usually singly at the shoulder by men and on the breast by women , and with the pin pointing up ; an Irish law code says that in the event of injury from a pin to another person , the wearer is not at fault if the pin did not project too far and the brooch was worn in these ways by the sexes . The most elaborate examples were clearly significant expressions of status at the top of society , which were also worn by clergy , at least in Ireland , though probably to fasten copes and other vestments rather than as everyday wear . The Senchas Mhor , an early Irish law tract , specified that the sons of major kings , when being fostered , should have brooches of gold having crystal inserted in them , while the sons of minor kings need wear only silver brooches .",

The empire was centered in Khorasan and Transoxiana during its existence ; at its greatest extent , the empire encompassed all of today 's Afghanistan , large parts of Iran , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan , and parts of Kazakhstan and Pakistan . The Samanid state was founded by four brothers ; Nuh , Ahmad , Yahya , and Ilyas - each of them ruled their own territory under Abbasid suzerainty . In 892 , Ismail Samani ( 892-907 ) united the Samanid state under one ruler , thus effectively putting an end to the feudal system used by the Samanids . It was also under him that the Samanids became independent of Abbasid authority . The Samanid Empire is part of the Iranian Intermezzo , which saw the creation of a Persianate culture and identity that brought Iranian speech and traditions into the fold of the Islamic world . This would later lead to the formation of the Turko-Persian culture . The Samanids promoted the arts , giving rise to the advancement of science and literature , and thus attracted scholars such as Rudaki , Ferdowsi , and Avicenna . While under Samanid control , Bukhara was a rival to Baghdad in its glory . Scholars note that the Samanids revived Persian language and culture more than the Buyids and the Saffarids , while continuing to patronize Arabic for sciences as well as the religious studies . They considered themselves to be descendants of the Sasanian Empire . In a famous edict , Samanid authorities declared that here , in this region , the language is Persian , and the kings of this realm are Persian kings .",
