The band emerged from a surrealist musical theatre troupe , The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo , that Elfman had led and written material for in the years previous . Oingo Boingo were known for their high energy live concerts and experimental music , which can be described as mixing rock , ska , pop , and world music . The band 's body of work spanned 17 years , with various genre and line-up changes . Their best-known songs include Only a Lad , Dead Man 's Party and Weird Science . As a rock band , Oingo Boingo started as a ska and punk-influenced new wave octet , achieving significant popularity in Southern California . During the mid-1980s , the band changed line-ups and adopted a more pop oriented style , until a significant genre change to alternative rock in 1994 . At that point , the name was shortened to simply Boingo and the keyboardist and horn section were dropped . The band retired after a farewell concert on Halloween 1995 , for which they reverted to the name Oingo Boingo and readopted the horn section .",

  "/wiki/Police_Truck": "Police Truck is a song by the Dead Kennedys . The song was originally released in May , 1980 , as the B-side of the Holiday in Cambodia single and later released in June 1987 on the DKs ' compilation album , Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death . The song is a satirical attack on the actions of two police officers , and takes a first person view from the authorities themselves . The song was inspired by an incident that occurred in Los Angeles in the late 1970s in which two police officers performed illegal activities such as drinking on the job , beating up drunks , and raping prostitutes . It also functions more generally as an attack on police corruption and brutality and the police 's support for a capitalist system . The song was one of the Kennedys ' early popular songs . Police Truck is built around a surf rock beat ( similar to ones heard in the early instrumental surf singles such as The Chantays ' Pipeline ) , and highlighted by East Bay Ray 's echoed guitar leads and the descending chorus ride , ride , how we ride . Police Truck , like many of the band 's songs , serves as an example of the Dead Kennedys ' ability to portray a disturbing scenario through humorous lyrics . The song later appeared in the soundtrack of the popular skateboarding video game Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater , after being licensed by the former Dead Kennedys . This licensing caused criticism from many Dead Kennedys fans , who used it to assert that East Bay Ray , Klaus Flouride , and D.H. Peligro are no longer committed to the band 's anti-corporate beliefs , unlike vocalist Jello Biafra ; however , Alternative Tentacles gave approval for the song to appear in the game . Biafra denies that this happened . The song appears as a cover in the game Guitar Hero Encore : Rocks the 80s with altered lyrics ( The word drunks at the beginning of the song is replaced by punks , while ass is replaced by butt , shit is replaced by stool and suck my dick is replaced by take your pick ) .",
  "/wiki/Dead_Kennedys": "Dead Kennedys are an American punk rock band that formed in San Francisco , California , in 1978 . The band was one of the defining hardcore punk bands during its initial eight-year run . Dead Kennedys ' lyrics were usually political in nature , satirizing establishment political figures ( liberal and conservative ) and authority in general , as well as popular culture and even the punk movement itself . During their initial incarnation between 1978 and 1986 , they attracted considerable controversy for their provocative lyrics and artwork . Several stores refused to stock their recordings , provoking debate about censorship in rock music ; in the mid-1980s , vocalist and primary lyricist Jello Biafra became an active campaigner against the Parents Music Resource Center . This culminated in an obscenity trial between 1985 and 1986 , which resulted in a hung jury . The group released a total of four studio albums and one EP before disbanding in 1986 . Following the band 's dissolution , Biafra continued to collaborate and record with other artists including D.O.A. , NoMeansNo and his own bands Lard and the Guantanamo School of Medicine , as well as releasing several spoken word performances . In 2000 ( upheld on appeal in 2003 ) , Biafra lost an acrimonious legal case initiated by his former Dead Kennedys band mates over songwriting credits and unpaid royalties . In 2001 , the band reformed without Biafra ; various singers have since been recruited for vocal duties ."
