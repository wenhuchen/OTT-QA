It is usually simmered overnight for 12 hours or more , and eaten for lunch on Shabbat ( the Sabbath ) . Cholent was developed over the centuries to conform with Jewish laws that prohibit cooking on the Sabbath . The pot is brought to a boil on Friday before the Sabbath begins , and kept on a blech or hotplate , or left in a slow oven or electric slow cooker , until the following day . There are many variations of the dish , which is standard in both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi kitchens . The basic ingredients of cholent are meat , potatoes , beans and barley . Sephardi-style hamin often uses rice or wheat kernels and chickpeas instead of beans and barley , and chicken instead of beef . A traditional Sephardi addition is whole eggs in the shell ( huevos haminados ) , which turn brown overnight . Ashkenazi cholent often contains kishke ( a sausage casing ) or helzel ( a chicken neck skin stuffed with a flour-based mixture ) . Slow overnight cooking allows the flavors of the various ingredients to permeate and produces the characteristic taste of cholent .",

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . Its territory also includes two archipelagoes : the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea . The African enclaves of Ceuta , Melilla , and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have a physical border with an African country ( Morocco ) . [ h ] Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory . The country 's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population ( about 47 million ) , Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union . Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Zaragoza , M\u00e1laga and Bilbao . Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",
  "/wiki/Spanish_Jews": "Spanish and Portuguese Jews , also called Western Sephardim , are a distinctive sub-group of Iberian Jews who are largely descended from Jews who lived as New Christians in the Iberian Peninsula during the immediate generations following the forced expulsion of unconverted Jews from Spain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1497 . Although the 1492 and 1497 expulsions of unconverted Jews from Spain and Portugal were separate events from the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions ( which was established over a decade earlier in 1478 ) , they were ultimately linked , as the Inquisition eventually also led to the fleeing out of Iberia of many descendants of Jewish converts to Catholicism in subsequent generations . Despite the fact that the original Edicts of Expulsion did not apply to Jewish-origin New Christian conversos - as these were now legally Christians - the discriminatory practices that the Inquisition nevertheless placed upon them , which were often lethal , put immense pressure on many of the Jewish-origin Christians to also emigrate out of Spain and Portugal in the immediate generations following the expulsion of their unconverted Jewish brethren . The Alhambra Decree ( also known as the Edict of Expulsion ) was an edict issued on 31 March 1492 , by the joint Catholic Monarchs of Spain ( Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon ) ordering the expulsion of all unconverted practicing Jews from the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon , including from all its territories and possessions , by 31 July of that year . The primary purpose of the expulsion was to eliminate the influence of unconverted Jews on Spain 's by then large Jewish-origin New Christian converso population , to ensure that the prior did not encourage the latter to relapse and revert to Judaism . Over half of Spain 's Jewish origin population had converted to Catholicism as a result of the religious anti-Jewish persecution and pogroms which occurred in 1391 . As a result of the Alhambra decree and persecution in prior years , it is estimated that of Spain 's total Jewish origin population at the time , over 200,000 Jews converted to Catholicism , and initially remained in Spain . Between 40,000 and 80,000 did not convert to Catholicism , and by their steadfast commitment to remain Jewish were thus expelled . Of those who were expelled as unconverted Jews , an indeterminate number nonetheless converted to Catholicism once outside Spain and eventually returned to Spain in the years following the expulsion due to the hardships many experienced in their resettlement . Many of Spain 's Jews who left Spain as Jews also initially moved to Portugal , where they were subsequently forcibly converted to the Catholic Church in 1497 . Most of the Jews who left Spain as Jews accepted the hospitality of Sultan Bayezid II and , after the Alhambra Decree , moved to the Ottoman Empire , where they founded communities openly practising the Jewish religion ; they and their descendants are known as Eastern Sephardim . During the centuries following the Spanish and Portuguese decrees , some of the Jewish-origin New Christian conversos started emigrating from Portugal and Spain , settling until the 1700s throughout areas of Western Europe and non-Iberian realms of the colonial Americas ( mostly Dutch realms , including Cura\u00e7ao in the Dutch West Indies , Recife in Dutch areas of colonial Brazil which eventually were regained by the Portuguese , and New Amsterdam which later became New York ) forming communities and formally reverting to Judaism .",

  "/wiki/Levant": "The Levant ( Arabic : \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0645 , Sh\u0101m , English /l\u0259\u02c8v\u00e6nt/ ) is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean region of Western Asia . In its narrowest sense , it is equivalent to the historical region of Syria , which included present-day Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Israel and Palestine . In its widest historical sense , the Levant included all of the Eastern Mediterranean with its islands ; that is , it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores , extending from Greece to Cyrenaica in eastern Libya . The term entered English in the late 15th century from French . It derives from the Italian Levante , meaning rising , implying the rising of the sun in the east , and is broadly equivalent to the term al-Mashriq ( Arabic : \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0642 , [ \u0294al.ma\u0283.riq ] ) , meaning the eastern place , where the sun rises . In the 13th and 14th centuries , the term levante was used for Italian maritime commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean , including Greece , Anatolia , Syria-Palestine , and Egypt , that is , the lands east of Venice . Eventually the term was restricted to the Muslim countries of Syria-Palestine and Egypt . In 1581 , England set up the Levant Company to monopolize commerce with the Ottoman Empire . The name Levant States was used to refer to the French mandate over Syria and Lebanon after World War I . This is probably the reason why the term Levant has come to be used more specifically to refer to modern Syria , Lebanon , Palestine , Israel , Jordan , and Cyprus . Some scholars mistakenly believed that it derives from the name of Lebanon . Today the term is often used in conjunction with prehistoric or ancient historical references .",

It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south , while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea . Lebanon 's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity . At just 10,452 km2 ( 4,036 mi2 ) , it is the smallest recognized sovereign state on the mainland Asian continent . [ nb 4 ] The earliest evidence of civilization in Lebanon dates back more than seven thousand years , predating recorded history . Lebanon was the home of the Canaanites/Phoenicians and their kingdoms , a maritime culture that flourished for almost three thousand years ( c. 3200-539 BC ) . In 64 BC , the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire , and eventually became one of the Empire 's leading centers of Christianity . In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite Church was established . As the Arab Muslims conquered the region , the Maronites held onto their religion and identity . However , a new religious group , the Druze , established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well , generating a religious divide that has lasted for centuries . During the Crusades , the Maronites re-established contact with the Roman Catholic Church and asserted their communion with Rome . The ties they established with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era .",

The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East ( as opposed to the Far East ) beginning in the early 20th century . The broader concept of the Greater Middle East ( or Middle East and North Africa ) also adds the Maghreb , Sudan , Djibouti , Somalia , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and sometimes even Central Asia and Transcaucasia into the region . The term Middle East has led to some confusion over its changing definitions . Most Middle Eastern countries ( 13 out of 18 ) are part of the Arab world . The history of the Middle East dates back to ancient times , with the geopolitical importance of the region being recognized for millennia . Several major religions have their origins in the Middle East , including Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Arabs constitute the majority ethnic group in the region , followed by Turks , Persians , Kurds , Azeris , Copts , Jews , Assyrians , Iraqi Turkmen , and Greek Cypriots . The Middle East generally has a hot , arid climate , with several major rivers providing irrigation to support agriculture in limited areas such as the Nile Delta in Egypt , the Tigris and Euphrates watersheds of Mesopotamia ( Iraq , Kuwait , and eastern Syria ) , and most of what is known as the Fertile Crescent .

The Dead Sea is located along its western borders and the country has a 26-kilometre ( 16 mi ) coastline on the Red Sea in its extreme south-west . Jordan is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia , Africa and Europe . The capital , Amman , is Jordan 's most populous city as well as the country 's economic , political and cultural centre . What is now Jordan has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period . Three stable kingdoms emerged there at the end of the Bronze Age : Ammon , Moab and Edom . Later rulers include the Nabataean Kingdom , the Roman Empire , and the Ottoman Empire . After the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in 1916 during World War I , the Ottoman Empire was partitioned by Britain and France . The Emirate of Transjordan was established in 1921 by the Hashemite , then Emir , Abdullah I , and the emirate became a British protectorate . In 1946 , Jordan became an independent state officially known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan , but was renamed in 1949 to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan after the country captured the West Bank during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and annexed it until it was lost to Israel in 1967 .

Related biblical , religious and historical English terms include the Land of Canaan , the Promised Land , the Holy Land , and Palestine ( see also Israel ( disambiguation ) ) . The definitions of the limits of this territory vary between passages in the Hebrew Bible , with specific mentions in Genesis 15 , Exodus 23 , Numbers 34 and Ezekiel 47 . Nine times elsewhere in the Bible , the settled land is referred as from Dan to Beersheba , and three times it is referred as from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt ( 1 Kings 8:65 , 1 Chronicles 13:5 and 2 Chronicles 7:8 ) . These biblical limits for the land differ from the borders of established historical Israelite and later Jewish kingdoms ; over time these have included the United Kingdom of Israel , the two separated kingdoms of Israel ( Samaria ) and Judah , the Hasmonean Kingdom , and the Herodian kingdom , which at their heights ruled lands with similar but not identical boundaries . Jewish religious belief defines the land as where Jewish religious law prevailed and excludes territory where it was not applied . It holds that the area is a God-given inheritance of the Jewish people based on the Torah , particularly the books of Genesis and Exodus , as well as on the later Prophets . According to the Book of Genesis , the land was first promised by God to the descendants of Abram ; the text is explicit that this is a covenant between God and Abram for his descendants . Abram 's name was later changed to Abraham , with the promise refined to pass through his son Isaac and to the Israelites , descendants of Jacob , Abraham 's grandson . This belief is not shared by most adherents of replacement theology ( or supersessionism ) , who hold the view that the Old Testament prophecies were superseded by the coming of Jesus , a view often repudiated by Christian Zionists as a theological error . Evangelical Zionists variously claim that Israel has title to the land by divine right , or by a theological , historical and moral grounding of attachment to the land unique to Jews ( James Parkes ) . The idea that ancient religious texts can be warrant or divine right for a modern claim has often been challenged , and Israeli courts have rejected land claims based on religious motivations .",

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

  "/wiki/Sour": "Taste , gustatory perception , or gustation ( Adjectival form : gustatory ) is one of the five traditional senses which belongs to the gustatory system . Taste is the sensation produced or stimulated when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity , mostly on the tongue . Taste , along with smell ( olfaction ) and trigeminal nerve stimulation ( registering texture , pain , and temperature ) , determines flavors of food and/or other substances . Humans have taste receptors on taste buds ( gustatory calyculi ) and other areas including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis . The gustatory cortex is responsible for the perception of taste . The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae , which are visible to the naked eye . Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds . The exception to this is the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds . There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue . Others are located on the roof , sides and back of the mouth , and in the throat . Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells . The sensation of taste includes five established basic tastes : sweetness , sourness , saltiness , bitterness , and savoriness ( also known as savory or umami ) .",
