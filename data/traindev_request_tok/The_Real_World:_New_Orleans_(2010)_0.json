  "/wiki/Power_tool": "A power tool is a tool that is actuated by an additional power source and mechanism other than the solely manual labor used with hand tools . The most common types of power tools use electric motors . Internal combustion engines and compressed air are also commonly used . Other power sources include steam engines , direct burning of fuels and propellants , such as in powder-actuated tools , or even natural power sources such as wind or moving water . Tools directly driven by animal power are not generally considered power tools . Power tools are used in industry , in construction , in the garden , for housework tasks such as cooking , cleaning , and around the house for purposes of driving ( fasteners ) , drilling , cutting , shaping , sanding , grinding , routing , polishing , painting , heating and more . Power tools are classified as either stationary or portable , where portable means hand-held . Portable power tools have obvious advantages in mobility . Stationary power tools , however , often have advantages in speed and precision . A typical table saw , for instance , not only cuts faster than a regular hand saw , but the cuts are smoother , straighter , and more square than what is normally achievable with a hand-held power saw . Some stationary power tools can produce objects that can not be made in any other way . Lathes , for example , produce truly round objects .",

  "/wiki/Valedictorian": "Valedictorian is an academic title of success used in the United States , Canada , Philippines , and Armenia , ( and elsewhere in limited number of schools ) for the student who delivers the closing or farewell statement at a graduation ceremony ( called a valediction ) . The chosen valedictorian is traditionally the student with the highest ranking ( highest Grade Point Average , or GPA ) among their graduating class . The term is an Anglicised derivation of the Latin vale dicere ( to say farewell ) , historically rooted in the valedictorian 's traditional role as the final speaker at the graduation ceremony before the students receive their diplomas . The valedictory address generally is considered a final farewell to classmates , before they disperse to pursue their individual paths after graduating . In Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Ireland and India the title valedictorian is not used frequently . In Australia , the title is sometimes awarded to a member of a graduating university class on the basis of contribution to the school rather than academic success .

It is the world 's largest Baptist denomination , the largest Protestant denomination in the United States , and the second-largest Christian denomination in the United States , smaller only than the Catholic Church according to self-reported membership statistics ( see Christianity in the United States ) . The word Southern in Southern Baptist Convention stems from it having been organized in 1845 at Augusta , Georgia , by Baptists in the Southern United States who split with northern Baptists over the issue of slavery , with Southern Baptists strongly opposed to abolition and black civil rights . After the American Civil War , another split occurred when most freedmen set up independent black congregations , regional associations , and state and national conventions , such as the National Baptist Convention , which became the second-largest Baptist convention by the end of the 19th century . Since the 1940s , the Southern Baptist Convention has shifted from some of its regional and historical identification . Especially since the late 20th century , the SBC has sought new members among minority groups and to become much more diverse . In addition , while still heavily concentrated in the Southern United States , the Southern Baptist Convention has member churches across the United States and 41 affiliated state conventions . Southern Baptist churches are evangelical in doctrine and practice . As they emphasize the significance of the individual conversion experience , which is affirmed by the person having complete immersion in water for a believer 's baptism , they reject the practice of infant baptism . Other specific beliefs based on biblical interpretation can vary somewhat due to their congregational polity , which allows local autonomy . The average weekly attendance was 5,297,788 in 2018 .",

The use of cannabis for recreational purposes is prohibited in most countries ; however , many have adopted a policy of decriminalization to make simple possession a non-criminal offense ( often similar to a minor traffic violation ) . Others have much more severe penalties such as some Asian and Middle Eastern countries where possession of even small amounts is punished by imprisonment for several years . Countries that have legalized recreational cannabis are Canada , Georgia , South Africa , and Uruguay . In addition , eleven states and the District of Columbia in the United States and the Australian Capital Territory in Australia have legalized recreational cannabis .

Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female , obesity , lack of physical exercise , drinking alcohol , hormone replacement therapy during menopause , ionizing radiation , early age at first menstruation , having children late or not at all , older age , prior history of breast cancer , and family history . About 5-10% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person 's parents , including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others . Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk . Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas , while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas . In addition , there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer . Some cancers , such as ductal carcinoma in situ , develop from pre-invasive lesions . The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump . Once the diagnosis is made , further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments are most likely to be effective . The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial .",

  "/wiki/Blackout_(alcohol-related_amnesia)": "A drug-related blackout is a phenomenon caused by the intake of any substance or medication in which short-term and long-term memory creation is impaired , therefore causing a complete inability to recall the past . Blackouts are frequently described as having effects similar to that of anterograde amnesia , in which the subject can not recall any events after the event that caused amnesia . Research on alcohol blackouts was done by E. M. Jellinek in the 1940s . Using data from a survey of Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA ) members , he came to believe that blackouts would be a good determinant of alcoholism . However , there are conflicting views whether this is true . The negative psychological effects of an alcohol-related blackout are often worsened by those who suffer from anxiety disorders . [ citation needed ] Impairment of the liver will also allow more alcohol to reach the brain and hasten the individual 's blackout .

The term coming out can also be used in various non-LGBT applications ( e.g . atheists ) .

Author Steven Seidman writes that it is the power of the closet to shape the core of an individual 's life that has made homosexuality into a significant personal , social , and political drama in twentieth-century America . Coming out of the closet is the source of other gay slang expressions related to voluntary disclosure or lack thereof . LGBT people who have already revealed or no longer conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity are out , i.e . openly LGBT . Oppositely , LGBT people who have yet to come out or have opted not to do so are labelled as closeted or being in the closet . Outing is the deliberate or accidental disclosure of an LGBT person 's sexual orientation or gender identity , without their consent . By extension , outing oneself is self-disclosure .

  "/wiki/Addiction": "Addiction is a brain disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite adverse consequences . Despite the involvement of a number of psychosocial factors , a biological process - one which is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus - is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction . The two properties that characterize all addictive stimuli are that they are reinforcing ( i.e. , they increase the likelihood that a person will seek repeated exposure to them ) and intrinsically rewarding ( i.e. , they are perceived as being inherently positive , desirable , and pleasurable ) . Addiction is a disorder of the brain 's reward system which arises through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms and develops over time from chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus ( e.g. , eating food , the use of cocaine , engagement in sexual activity , participation in high-thrill cultural activities such as gambling , etc. ) . DeltaFosB ( \u0394FosB ) , a gene transcription factor , is a critical component and common factor in the development of virtually all forms of behavioral and drug addictions . Two decades of research into \u0394FosB 's role in addiction have demonstrated that addiction arises , and the associated compulsive behavior intensifies or attenuates , along with the overexpression of \u0394FosB in the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens . Due to the causal relationship between \u0394FosB expression and addictions , it is used preclinically as an addiction biomarker . \u0394FosB expression in these neurons directly and positively regulates drug self-administration and reward sensitization through positive reinforcement , while decreasing sensitivity to aversion . [ note 1 ] Addiction exacts an astoundingly high financial and human toll on individuals and society as a whole . In the United States , the total economic cost to society is greater than that of all types of diabetes and all cancers combined . These costs arise from the direct adverse effects of drugs and associated healthcare costs ( e.g. , emergency medical services and outpatient and inpatient care ) , long-term complications ( e.g. , lung cancer from smoking tobacco products , liver cirrhosis and dementia from chronic alcohol consumption , and meth mouth from methamphetamine use ) , the loss of productivity and associated welfare costs , fatal and non-fatal accidents ( e.g. , traffic collisions ) , suicides , homicides , and incarceration , among others . Classic hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior , preoccupation with substance or behavior , and continued use despite consequences .",
  "/wiki/Painkiller": "An analgesic or painkiller is any member of the group of drugs used to achieve analgesia , relief from pain . Analgesic drugs act in various ways on the peripheral and central nervous systems . They are distinct from anesthetics , which temporarily affect , and in some instances completely eliminate , sensation . Analgesics include paracetamol ( known in North America as acetaminophen or simply APAP ) , the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) such as the salicylates , and opioid drugs such as morphine and oxycodone . When choosing analgesics , the severity and response to other medication determines the choice of agent ; the World Health Organization ( WHO ) pain ladder specifies mild analgesics as its first step . Analgesic choice is also determined by the type of pain : For neuropathic pain , traditional analgesics are less effective , and there is often benefit from classes of drugs that are not normally considered analgesics , such as tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants .",

  "/wiki/Middle_Eastern": "The Middle East is a transcontinental region which includes Western Asia ( although generally excluding the Caucasus ) and all of Egypt ( which is mostly in North Africa ) . The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East ( as opposed to the Far East ) beginning in the early 20th century . The broader concept of the Greater Middle East ( or Middle East and North Africa ) also adds the Maghreb , Sudan , Djibouti , Somalia , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and sometimes even Central Asia and Transcaucasia into the region . The term Middle East has led to some confusion over its changing definitions . Most Middle Eastern countries ( 13 out of 18 ) are part of the Arab world . The history of the Middle East dates back to ancient times , with the geopolitical importance of the region being recognized for millennia . Several major religions have their origins in the Middle East , including Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Arabs constitute the majority ethnic group in the region , followed by Turks , Persians , Kurds , Azeris , Copts , Jews , Assyrians , Iraqi Turkmen , and Greek Cypriots . The Middle East generally has a hot , arid climate , with several major rivers providing irrigation to support agriculture in limited areas such as the Nile Delta in Egypt , the Tigris and Euphrates watersheds of Mesopotamia ( Iraq , Kuwait , and eastern Syria ) , and most of what is known as the Fertile Crescent .

  "/wiki/Liberal_movements_within_Islam": "Liberalism and progressivism within Islam involve professed Muslims who have created a considerable body of liberal thought about Islamic understanding and practice . Their work is sometimes characterized as progressive Islam ( Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u062f\u0645\u064a al-Isl\u0101m at-taqaddum\u012b ) ; some scholars , such as Omid Safi , regard progressive Islam and liberal Islam as two distinct movements . Liberal ideas are considered controversial by traditional Muslims , who criticize liberal ideas on the grounds of being too Western or rationalistic . The methodologies of liberal or progressive Islam rest on the interpretation of traditional Islamic scripture ( the Quran ) and other texts ( such as the Hadith ) , a process called ijtihad ( see below ) . [ page needed ] This can vary from the slight to the most liberal , where only the meaning of the Quran is considered to be a revelation , with its expression in words seen as the work of the prophet Muhammad in his particular time and context . Liberal Muslims see themselves as returning to the principles of the early Ummah ethical and pluralistic intent of the Quran . They distance themselves from some traditional and less liberal interpretations of Islamic law which they regard as culturally based and without universal applicability . [ citation needed ] The reform movement uses monotheism ( tawhid ) as an organizing principle for human society and the basis of religious knowledge , history , metaphysics , aesthetics , and ethics , as well as social , economic and world order .",
