  "/wiki/Congregational_church": "Congregational churches ( also Congregationalist churches ; Congregationalism ) are Protestant churches in the Reformed tradition practicing congregationalist church governance , in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs . Congregationalism , as defined by the Pew Research Center , is estimated to represent 0.5 percent of the worldwide Protestant population ; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism , as well as other Christian congregations . The report defines it very narrowly , encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom , which can trace their history back to nonconforming Protestants , Puritans , Separatists , Independents , English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War , and other English dissenters not satisfied with the degree to which the Church of England had been reformed . Congregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States , the United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various island nations in the Pacific region . It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the London Missionary Society . A number of evangelical Congregational churches are members of the World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship . In the United Kingdom , many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations formed on a theory of union published by the theologian and English separatist Robert Browne in 1582 . Other accounts trace these origins further back to the London Underground Church of the 1560s . Ideas of nonconforming Protestants during the Puritan Reformation of the Church of England laid foundation for these churches . In England , the early Congregationalists were called Separatists or Independents to distinguish them from the similarly Calvinistic Presbyterians , whose churches embrace a polity based on the governance of elders . Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using episcopalian church governance , which is usually led by a bishop . Congregationalism in the United States traces its origins to the Puritans of New England , who wrote the Cambridge Platform of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others .",
  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Methodism": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Governance_of_the_Methodist_Church_of_Great_Britain": "Governance of the Methodist Church of Great Britain is based on the principle of connexionalism - a highly centralised structure . From its inception under John Wesley , Methodism has always laid strong emphasis on the interdependence and mutual support , in terms of ministry , mission and finance , of one local congregation for another . The Church community has never been seen in isolation either from its immediately neighbouring Church communities or from the centralised national organisation . Wesley himself journeyed around the country , preaching , evangelizing and establishing local worshipping communities , often under lay leadership . Soon these local communities of worshipping Christians formalised their relationships with neighbouring Methodist communities to create Circuits , and the Circuits and Churches contained within them , were from the very beginning 'connected ' ( hence the peculiarly Methodist concept of the 'Connexion ' ) to the centre and Methodism 's governing body , the annual Conference . A Circuit is a group of Local Churches under the care of one or more ministers . The Circuit is the main functional unit of Methodism , in that a large number of activities are organised at this level . For example , ministers are appointed firstly to the Circuit and secondly to the pastoral care of Local Churches . Preaching appointments for both ministers and ( lay ) Local Preachers are organised by the Circuit and advertised on a Preaching Plan issued every three months by the leader of the Circuit , the Superintendent Minister . Upwards , Circuits are grouped into geographical Districts , headed a District Chair . Through the work of its annual conference and working parties the Methodist Church is also exploring the value of an organisational and operational tier 'larger than circuit ' in sustaining its mission . Methodist Churches which were established by British Missionaries are also modelled on the structure of the British Church .",

  "/wiki/Lancet_window": "A lancet window is a tall , narrow window with a pointed arch at its top . It acquired the lancet name from its resemblance to a lance . Instances of this architectural motif are typical of Gothic church edifices of the earliest period . Lancet windows may occur singly , or paired under a single moulding , or grouped in an odd number with the tallest window at the centre . The architectural motif first appeared in the early French Gothic period ( c. 1140-1200 ) , and later in the English period of Gothic architecture ( 1200-1275 ) . So common was the lancet window feature that this era is sometimes known as the Lancet Period . The term lancet window is properly applied to windows of austere form , without tracery . Paired windows were sometimes surmounted by a simple opening such as a quatrefoil cut in plate tracery . This form gave way to the more ornate , multi-light traceried windowed .",
  "/wiki/Tracery": "In architecture , tracery is the stonework elements that support the glass in a Gothic window . The term probably derives from the 'tracing floors ' on which the complex patterns of late Gothic windows were laid out . There are two main types , plate tracery and the later bar tracery . The evolving style from Romanesque to Gothic architecture and changing features , like the thinning of lateral walls and enlarging of windows lead to the innovation of tracery . The earliest form of tracery , called plate tracery , began as openings that were pierced from a stone slab . Bar tracery was then implemented , having derived from the plate tracery . However instead of a slab , the windows were defined by molded stone mullions which were lighter and allowed for more openings and intricate designs . Other notable styles of tracery to follow include geometrical tracery and curvilinear ( flowing ) tracery .",

  "/wiki/Anglicanism": "Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition which has developed from the practices , liturgy , and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation . Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans , or Episcopalians in some countries . The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion , which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world , after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church . They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury , and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury , whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares ( Latin , first among equals ) . He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference , chairs the meeting of primates , and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council . Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican , including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment . Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible , traditions of the apostolic Church , apostolic succession ( historic episcopate ) , and the writings of the Church Fathers . Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity , having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism . These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them , Thomas Cranmer , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . In the first half of the 17th century , the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition , with theologies , structures , and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way , or via media , between Protestantism and Catholicism - a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as Catholic and Reformed . The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion .",

  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies .

  "/wiki/Wesleyan_theology": "Wesleyan theology , otherwise known as Wesleyan-Arminian theology , or Methodist theology , is a theological tradition in Protestant Christianity that emphasizes the methods of the eighteenth-century evangelical reformers John Wesley and his brother Charles Wesley . More broadly , it refers to the theological system inferred from the various sermons , theological treatises , letters , journals , diaries , hymns , and other spiritual writings of the Wesleys and their contemporary coadjutors such as John William Fletcher . Wesleyan-Arminian theology , manifest today in Methodism ( inclusive of the Holiness movement ) , is named for its founders , the Wesleys , as well as for Jacob Arminius , since it is a subset of Arminian theology . In 1736 , these two brothers traveled to the Georgia colony in America as missionaries for the Church of England ; they left rather disheartened at what they saw . Both of them subsequently had religious experiences , especially John in 1738 , being greatly influenced by the Moravian Christians . They began to organize a renewal movement within the Church of England to focus on personal faith and holiness . John Wesley took Protestant churches to task over the nature of sanctification , the process by which a believer is conformed to the image of Christ , emphasizing New Testament teachings regarding the work of God and the believer in sanctification . The movement did well within the Church of England in Britain , but when the movement crossed the ocean into America , it took on a form of its own , finally being established as the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1784 . The Methodist churches are similar to Anglicanism ( in Church government and liturgical practices ) , yet have added a strong emphasis on personal faith and personal experience , especially on the new birth and entire sanctification . At its heart , the theology of John Wesley stressed the life of Christian holiness : to love God with all ones heart , mind , soul and strength , and to love one 's neighbour as oneself . Wesleys teaching also stressed experiential religion and moral responsibility .",

  "/wiki/Corrugated_galvanised_iron": "Corrugated galvanised iron or steel ( colloquially corrugated iron ( near universal ) , wriggly tin ( taken from UK military slang ) , pailing ( in Caribbean English ) , corrugated sheet metal ( in North America ) and occasionally abbreviated CGI ) is a building material composed of sheets of hot-dip galvanised mild steel , cold-rolled to produce a linear corrugated pattern in them . Although it is still popularly called iron in the UK , the material used is actually steel ( which is iron alloyed with carbon for strength , commonly 0.3% carbon ) , and only the surviving vintage sheets may actually be made up of 100% iron . The corrugations increase the bending strength of the sheet in the direction perpendicular to the corrugations , but not parallel to them , because the steel must be stretched to bend perpendicular to the corrugations . Normally each sheet is manufactured longer in its strong direction . CGI is lightweight and easily transported .

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
