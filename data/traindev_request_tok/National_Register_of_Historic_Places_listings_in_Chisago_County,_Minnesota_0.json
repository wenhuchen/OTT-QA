  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Shell_midden": "A midden ( also kitchen midden or shell heap ) is an old dump for domestic waste which may consist of animal bone , human excrement , botanical material , mollusc shells , sherds , lithics ( especially debitage ) , and other artifacts and ecofacts associated with past human occupation . These features , therefore , provide a useful resource for archaeologists who wish to study the diets and habits of past societies . Middens with damp , anaerobic conditions can even preserve organic remains in deposits as the debris of daily life are tossed on the pile . Each individual toss will contribute a different mix of materials depending upon the activity associated with that particular toss . During the course of deposition sedimentary material is deposited as well . Different mechanisms , from wind and water to animal digs , create a matrix which can also be analysed to provide seasonal and climatic information . In some middens individual dumps of material can be discerned and analysed .",
  "/wiki/Mussel": "Mussel ( /\u02c8m\u028cs\u0259l/ ) is the common name used for members of several families of bivalve molluscs , from saltwater and freshwater habitats . These groups have in common a shell whose outline is elongated and asymmetrical compared with other edible clams , which are often more or less rounded or oval . The word mussel is frequently used to mean the bivalves of the marine family Mytilidae , most of which live on exposed shores in the intertidal zone , attached by means of their strong byssal threads ( beard ) to a firm substrate . A few species ( in the genus Bathymodiolus ) have colonised hydrothermal vents associated with deep ocean ridges . In most marine mussels the shell is longer than it is wide , being wedge-shaped or asymmetrical . The external colour of the shell is often dark blue , blackish , or brown , while the interior is silvery and somewhat nacreous . The common name mussel is also used for many freshwater bivalves , including the freshwater pearl mussels . Freshwater mussel species inhabit lakes , ponds , rivers , creeks , canals , and they are classified in a different subclass of bivalves , despite some very superficial similarities in appearance . Freshwater zebra mussels and their relatives in the family Dreissenidae are not related to previously mentioned groups , even though they resemble many Mytilus species in shape , and live attached to rocks and other hard surfaces in a similar manner , using a byssus . They are classified with the Heterodonta , the taxonomic group which includes most of the bivalves commonly referred to as clams .",
  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

Center City became the county seat of Chisago County in the 1870s , during a time of Swedish migration and settlement in the county . The buildings in the historic district include the Chisago Lake Evangelical Lutheran Church , which was the main Swedish Lutheran parish in the area , as well as a number of residences built between 1888 and 1910 . The homes have moderate ornamentation and attention to architectural styling details of their period . The Center City Historic District is significant as a link to the Swedish Lutheran population of the Chisago Lakes region during the area 's most important period of development and as the county 's finest concentration of late nineteenth and early twentieth century residences . When the railroad arrived in the Chisago Lakes region in 1881 , the area witnessed significant growth . The residences within the Center City Historic District , housed merchants , tradesmen , professionals , politicians , and retired farmers . They are reflective of the growing prosperity of the region . The Chisago Lake Evangelical Lutheran Church is the second-oldest Lutheran congregation in Minnesota .

As a state highway in the three states , US 8 is maintained by the Minnesota , Wisconsin and Michigan departments of transportation ( MnDOT , WisDOT , MDOT , respectively ) . The highway was originally commissioned on November 11 , 1926 , with the rest of the original U.S. Highway System . At the time , it ran between Forest Lake , Minnesota , and Pembine , Wisconsin , with a planned continuation to Powers , Michigan . Several changes have been made to the routing of the highway since then . The western end was extended south to Minneapolis before it was truncated back to Forest Lake . Other changes on the east end have moved that terminus from the originally planned end location at Powers to the current location in Norway . Internal Wisconsin and Michigan DOT map files at various times have shown plans to reroute the highway to connect to the original 1926 terminus . US 8 's course through the three states has also been shifted to follow different alignments over the years .

  "/wiki/New_Deal": "The New Deal was a series of programs , public work projects , financial reforms , and regulations enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1939 . It responded to needs for relief , reform , and recovery from the Great Depression . Major federal programs and agencies included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . They provided support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly . The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply . New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the 3 Rs : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels , and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional [ clarification needed ] Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and non-whites and ethnic whites . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth and liberals in support . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964 .",
  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes . Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures , including entrance gateways , hotels and lodges , park roads and bridges , visitor centers , trail shelters , informational kiosks , and even mundane maintenance and support facilities . Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",
  "/wiki/Moody_Barn": "The Moody Barn is a round barn in Chisago Lake Township , Chisago County , Minnesota , United States . The farm was first homesteaded in 1871 by Elof and Eva Modig , who emigrated from Sweden . The couple raised five children and grew wheat on their farm , as was common in the 1870s . By the 1890s Minnesota farming had begun to diversify , with cheese and butter production becoming popular and distributed by cooperative creameries . In 1915 Charles Moody , one of the sons , decided to build a modern round barn . The barn is 56 feet ( 17 m ) in diameter and about the same in height . The interior contains a 42-foot high ( 13 m ) silo . The first floor of the barn housed milk cows and their calves , while the second floor was used to store hay . Instead of the traditional red and white paint , the Moody barn was painted in a blue-gray color . The construction cost was $ 3200 , with seven men paid $ 1 per day plus meals for the construction .
