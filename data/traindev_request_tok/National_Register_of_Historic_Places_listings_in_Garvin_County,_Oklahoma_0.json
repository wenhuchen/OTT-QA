  "/wiki/Oklahoma_State_Highway_74": "State Highway 74 , usually abbreviated as SH-74 or OK-74 ( or simply Highway 74 ) is the numbering of two different highways maintained by the U.S. state of Oklahoma . These highways were once a single major north-south route , connecting Oklahoma City to more rural parts of the state . The original road stretched from SH-7 near Tatums , Oklahoma to SH-11 west of Deer Creek . Due to encroaching Interstate highways - especially Interstate 35 - the middle section of the route through Norman , Moore , and Oklahoma City was decommissioned in 1979 for reasons of redundancy . However , some maps show SH-74 as concurrent with I-35 , I-240 , and I-44 , thus linking the two sections . The north section of the route is 91 1\u20442 miles ( 147.3 km ) in length , while the southern section is 52 1\u20442 miles ( 84.5 km ) long . This leads to a total length of 144 miles ( 232 km ) .",

  "/wiki/Fort_Arbuckle_(Oklahoma)": "Fort Arbuckle was constructed by the US Army in 1850 to counter raids by Plains Indian tribes on immigrant trains heading west to California and on the settlements of Choctaw and Chickasaw nations in Indian Territory . Captain Randolph B. Marcy was assigned to select the site and oversee construction of the fort , named to honor the recently deceased General Matthew Arbuckle . The site was inside the boundary of the Chickasaw Nation and on the bank of the Washita River , 6 miles ( 9.7 km ) west and 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) north of the present town of Davis , Oklahoma . The overall size of the post was originally 12 miles ( 19 km ) by 12 miles ( 19 km ) , allowing enough room for friendly tribes to camp under the protection of the post . Marcy and his men constructed a rectangular fort , with barracks on opposite sides and the quartermaster and commissary facilities at opposite ends . Eventually the fort consisted of thirty buildings constructed of hewn logs , with stone chimneys . Major William H. Emory of the First Cavalry was appointed commander of both Fort Arbuckle and Fort Washita in 1858 . He found the facilities at the fort inadequate . Many of the buildings were in a poor state of repair ; ordnance stores were depleted ; and surplus ammunition and gunpowder had to be buried in order to be weather protected . But before the troops could remedy these faults , they received orders to build another fort , this one named Fort Cobb . On May 3 , 1861 , after the Civil War broke out , Major Emory ordered the three forts under his command to be evacuated , with the troops going to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas , which supported the Union . The government of the Chickasaw Nation had already decided to support the Confederacy .",
