  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

With an estimated population of 391,006 in 2018 , it is the most populous city in Louisiana . Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States . New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80% of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50% . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population .",
  "/wiki/Liberty_ship": "Liberty ships were a class of cargo ship built in the United States during World War II . Though British in concept , the design was adapted by the United States for its simple , low-cost construction . Mass-produced on an unprecedented scale , the Liberty ship came to symbolize U.S. wartime industrial output . The class was developed to meet British orders for transports to replace ships that had been lost . Eighteen American shipyards built 2,710 Liberty ships between 1941 and 1945 ( an average of three ships every two days ) , easily the largest number of ships ever produced to a single design . Their production mirrored ( albeit on a much larger scale ) the manufacture of Hog Islander and similar standardized ship types during World War I . The immensity of the effort , the number of ships built , the role of female workers in their construction , and the survival of some far longer than their original five-year design life combine to make them the subject of much continued interest .",

The Seattle shipyard could trace its history back to 1882 , when Robert Moran opened a marine repair shop at Yesler 's Wharf . This shop became the Moran Brothers Shipyard in 1906 and the Seattle Construction & Dry Dock Company at the end of 1911 . The shipyard has performed building and maintenance work for , among others , the U.S. and Royal Australian Navies , the United States Coast Guard , and the Washington State Ferries . Its headquarters and operations are on Harbor Island at the mouth of Seattle 's Duwamish Waterway . Todd ranked 26th among United States corporations in the value of World War II production contracts . The 105-foot-long ( 32 m ) hull of Disneyland 's Mark Twain riverboat was built at Todd Shipyards in San Pedro , California , in 1955 . Frank Sinatra worked after high school as a rivet catcher . In February 2011 , Vigor Industrial purchased Todd for US $ 130 million . This included the Seattle , Everett and Bremerton operations . Today , Vigor Shipyards is a government repair subsidiary of Vigor Industrial .

Located in Southeast Texas near Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico , it is the seat of Harris County and the principal city of the Greater Houston metropolitan area , which is the fifth most populous metropolitan statistical area in the United States and the second most populous in Texas after the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex , with a population of 6,997,384 in 2018 . Comprising a total area of 637.4 square miles ( 1,651 km2 ) , Houston is the eighth most expansive city in the United States ( including consolidated city-counties ) . It is the largest city in the United States by total area , whose government is not consolidated with that of a county , parish or borough . Though primarily in Harris County , small portions of the city extend into Fort Bend and Montgomery counties , bordering other principal communities of Greater Houston such as Sugar Land and The Woodlands . The city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30 , 1836 , at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou ( a point now known as Allen 's Landing ) and incorporated as a city on June 5 , 1837 . The city is named after former General Sam Houston , who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas ' independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of Allen 's Landing . After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s , Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century . The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston , including a burgeoning port and railroad industry , the decline of Galveston as Texas ' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane , the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel , and the Texas oil boom . In the mid-20th century , Houston 's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center - the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions - and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . Houston 's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation . Leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment , Houston has the second most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its city limits ( after New York City ) .",

One hundred and eighteen were completed , with four being combat ready . During the war only two were put into active service and went on patrols , but these were not used in combat . They were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged , rather than spending most of their time as surface ships that could submerge for brief periods as a means to escape detection . They incorporated many batteries to increase the time they could spend submerged , to as much as several days , and they only needed to surface to periscope depth for recharging via a snorkel . The design included many general improvements as well : much greater underwater speed by an improved hull design , greatly improved diving times , power-assisted torpedo reloading and greatly improved crew accommodations . However , the design was also flawed in many ways , with the submarines being mechanically unreliable and vulnerable to combat damage . The Type XXI submarines were also rushed into production before design work was complete , and the inexperienced facilities which constructed the boats were unable to meet necessary quality standards .
