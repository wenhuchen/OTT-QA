  "/wiki/RA-5C": "The North American A-5 Vigilante was an American carrier-based supersonic bomber designed and built by North American Aviation for the United States Navy . It set several world records , including long-distance speed and altitude records . Until the 1962 unification of Navy and Air Force designations , it was designated the A3J Vigilante . The aircraft briefly replaced the Douglas A-3 Skywarrior as the Navy 's primary nuclear-strike aircraft , but its RA-5C tactical strike reconnaissance variant saw extensive service during the Vietnam War .",

  "/wiki/Douglas_A-3_Skywarrior": "The Douglas A-3 Skywarrior was a jet-powered strategic bomber developed and produced by the Douglas Aircraft Company . It was designed by Douglas on behalf of the United States Navy , which sought a carrier-capable strategic bomber . During July 1949 , Douglas was awarded the contract to produce its design , having bested eight other aircraft companies ' submissions . Unlike rival designs , which had aimed for a 100,000 lb ( 45,000 kg ) maximum take-off weight , the Skywarrior was developed for a 68,000 lb ( 31,000 kg ) take-off weight , facilitating its use from the navy 's existing Midway-class aircraft carriers . Large portions of the aircraft were produced by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation , including its early Westinghouse J40 turbojet engines , which failed to meet promises and were replaced by the rival Pratt & Whitney J57 engine by mid-1953 . On 28 October 1952 , the prototype XA3D-1 performed the type 's maiden flight . On 31 March 1956 , the Skywarrior entered squadron service with the Navy . Initially used in the nuclear-armed strategic bomber role , the emergence of effective ballistic missiles led to this mission being deprioritised by the early 1960s . Throughout the majority of its later service life , the Skywarrior was tasked with various secondary missions , which included use as an electronic warfare platform , tactical reconnaissance aircraft , and high capacity aerial refueling tanker . It was among the longest serving carrier-based aircraft in history , having entered service during the mid-1950s and withdrawn from use in 1991 . Throughout its service , the Skywarrior was the heaviest operational aircraft to operate from an aircraft carrier , which contributed to its nickname of Whale . The Skywarrior is one of only two U.S. Navy attack aircraft intended as a strategic bomber to enter full-scale service , the other being its predecessor , the North American AJ Savage .",
  "/wiki/Douglas_A-4_Skyhawk": "The Douglas A-4 Skyhawk is a single-seat subsonic carrier-capable attack aircraft developed for the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps in the early 1950s . The delta-winged , single turbojet engined Skyhawk was designed and produced by Douglas Aircraft Company , and later by McDonnell Douglas . It was originally designated A4D under the U.S. Navy 's pre-1962 designation system . The Skyhawk is a relatively lightweight aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight of 24,500 pounds ( 11,100 kg ) and has a top speed of more than 670 miles per hour ( 1,080 km/h ) . The aircraft 's five hardpoints support a variety of missiles , bombs and other munitions . It is capable of carrying a bomb load equivalent to that of a World War II-era Boeing B-17 bomber , and can deliver nuclear weapons using a low-altitude bombing system and a loft delivery technique . The A-4 was originally powered by the Wright J65 turbojet engine ; from the A-4E onwards , the Pratt & Whitney J52 engine was used . Skyhawks played key roles in the Vietnam War , the Yom Kippur War , and the Falklands War . Sixty years after the aircraft 's first flight in 1954 , some of the 2,960 produced ( through February 1979 ) remain in service with the Argentine Air Force and the Brazilian Naval Aviation .",
