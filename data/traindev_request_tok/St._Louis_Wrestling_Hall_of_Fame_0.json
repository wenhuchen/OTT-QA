He also worked as King Kong Brody , The Masked Marauder , and Red River Jack . Over the years Brody became synonymous with the hardcore wrestling brawling style that often saw one or more of the participants bleeding by the time the match was over .

He worked regularly in Japan for All Japan Pro Wrestling ( AJPW ) . Behind the scenes Goodish was very protective of his in-ring image , hardly ever agreeing to lose matches and building a reputation of being volatile ; he would on occasion intentionally hit or hurt opponents during a match contrary to the pre-determined nature of professional wrestling . His in-ring work and wrestling persona earned him an induction in the professional wrestling hall of fame , St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame , Southern Wrestling Hall of Fame , Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame and the WWE Hall of Fame . Goodish died in 1988 from stab wounds suffered backstage in a shower during a wrestling event in Puerto Rico . The killer was Jose Huertas Gonzalez , the wrestler known as Invader I . A jury acquitted Gonzalez of murder , ruling that Gonzalez killed Goodish in self-defence . Key witnesses to the killing did not give testimony at Gonzalez 's trial due to their summons only being received after the trial had concluded . This situation led to many US wrestlers not working in Puerto Rico for a long time afterward .",
  "/wiki/Professional_wrestling": "Professional wrestling , often shortened to pro wrestling or simply wrestling , is a form of performance art and entertainment that combines athletics with theatrical performance . It takes the form of events , held by touring companies , that mimic a title-match combat sport . The unique form of sport portrayed is fundamentally based on and evolved from classical and catch wrestling , with modern additions of striking attacks , strength-based holds and throws and acrobatic maneuvers . Much of these derive from the influence of various international martial arts . An additional aspect of combat with improvised weaponry is sometimes included . The matches have predetermined outcomes to heighten entertainment value and all combative maneuvers are executed with the full cooperation of those involved and carefully performed in specific manners intended to lessen the chance of actual injury . These facts were once kept highly secret but are now publicly acknowledged by both performers and promotions . To promote and sustain the willing suspension of disbelief by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude , the performing company avoids discussing the true nature of the performance in official media . Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media ( i.e. , interviews ) often directly acknowledge the dramatic and fixed nature of the spectacle . [ citation needed ]",

When an MMA or boxing bout concludes , the ring announcer announces the winner , time of finish and method .
