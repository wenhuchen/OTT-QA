  "/wiki/Electric_car": "An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors , using energy stored in rechargeable batteries . The first practical electric cars were produced in the 1880s . Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century , until advances in internal combustion engines , electric starters in particular , and mass production of cheaper gasoline vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles . From 2008 , a renaissance in electric vehicle manufacturing occurred due to advances in batteries , and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve urban air quality . Several national and local governments have established government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles , tax credits , subsidies , and other incentives to promote the introduction and adoption in the mass market of new electric vehicles , often depending on battery size , their electric range and purchase price . The current maximum tax credit allowed by the US Government is US $ 7,500 per car . Compared with internal combustion engine cars , electric cars are quieter , and have no tailpipe emissions and lower emissions in general . In January 2019 and updated in April , a Reuters analysis of 29 global automakers concluded that automakers are planning on spending $ 300 billion over the next 5 to 10 years on electric cars , with 45% of that investment projected to occur in China . Charging an electric car can be done at a variety of charging stations , these charging stations can be installed in both houses and public areas . The Tesla Model 3 was the world 's best selling EV from 2018 to 2019 and had a maximum electric range of 500 km ( 310 miles ) according to the EPA . As of December 2018 [ update ] , there were about 5.3 million light-duty all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in use around the world . Despite the rapid growth experienced , the global stock of plug-in electric cars represented just about 1 out of every 250 vehicles ( 0.40% ) on the world 's roads by the end of 2018 .",

  "/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle": "A hybrid electric vehicle ( HEV ) is a type of hybrid vehicle that combines a conventional internal combustion engine ( ICE ) system with an electric propulsion system ( hybrid vehicle drivetrain ) . The presence of the electric powertrain is intended to achieve either better fuel economy than a conventional vehicle or better performance . There is a variety of HEV types , and the degree to which each functions as an electric vehicle ( EV ) also varies . The most common form of HEV is the hybrid electric car , although hybrid electric trucks ( pickups and tractors ) and buses also exist . Modern HEVs make use of efficiency-improving technologies such as regenerative brakes which convert the vehicle 's kinetic energy to electric energy , which is stored in a battery or supercapacitor . Some varieties of HEV use an internal combustion engine to turn an electrical generator , which either recharges the vehicle 's batteries or directly powers its electric drive motors ; this combination is known as a motor-generator . Many HEVs reduce idle emissions by shutting down the engine at idle and restarting it when needed ; this is known as a start-stop system . A hybrid-electric produces less tailpipe emissions than a comparably sized gasoline car , since the hybrid 's gasoline engine is usually smaller than that of a gasoline-powered vehicle . If the engine is not used to drive the car directly , it can be geared to run at maximum efficiency , further improving fuel economy . Ferdinand Porsche developed the Lohner-Porsche in 1901 . But hybrid electric vehicles did not become widely available until the release of the Toyota Prius in Japan in 1997 , followed by the Honda Insight in 1999 . Initially , hybrid seemed unnecessary due to the low cost of gasoline .",

  "/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle": "A hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen fuel for motive power . Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen-fueled space rockets , as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles . The power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine , or , more commonly , by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors . Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed hydrogen economy . As of 2019 [ update ] , there are three models of hydrogen cars publicly available in select markets : the Toyota Mirai , the Hyundai Nexo , and the Honda Clarity . Several other companies are working to develop hydrogen cars . As of 2019 , 98% of hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming , which emits carbon dioxide . It can be produced by thermochemical or pyrolytic means using renewable feedstocks , but that is an expensive process . Various technologies are being developed that aim to deliver costs low enough , and quantities great enough , to compete with hydrogen production using natural gas . The drawbacks of hydrogen use are high carbon emissions intensity when produced from natural gas , capital cost burden , low energy content per unit volume at ambient conditions , production and compression of hydrogen , the investment required in filling stations to dispense hydrogen , transportation of hydrogen to filling stations and lack of ability to produce or dispense hydrogen at home .",
  "/wiki/Fuel_cell_car": "A fuel cell vehicle ( FCV ) or fuel cell electric vehicle ( FCEV ) is a type of electric vehicle which uses a fuel cell , instead of a battery , or in combination with a battery or supercapacitor , to power its on-board electric motor . Fuel cells in vehicles generate electricity to power the motor , generally using oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen . Most fuel cell vehicles are classified as zero-emissions vehicles that emit only water and heat . As compared with internal combustion vehicles , hydrogen vehicles centralize pollutants at the site of the hydrogen production , where hydrogen is typically derived from reformed natural gas . Transporting and storing hydrogen may also create pollutants . Fuel cells have been used in various kinds of vehicles including forklifts , especially in indoor applications where their clean emissions are important to air quality , and in space applications . The first commercially produced hydrogen fuel cell automobile , the Hyundai Tucson FCEV , was introduced in 2013 , Toyota Mirai followed in 2015 and then Honda entered the market . Fuel cells are being developed and tested in trucks , buses , boats , motorcycles and bicycles , among other kinds of vehicles . As of 2017 , there was limited hydrogen infrastructure , with 36 hydrogen fueling stations for automobiles publicly available in the U.S. , but more hydrogen stations are planned , particularly in California , where , as of 2019 , according to Hydrogen View , there have been over 7,500 FCEVs sold or leased . Critics doubt whether hydrogen will be efficient or cost-effective for automobiles , as compared with other zero emission technologies , and in 2019 , USA Today stated what is tough to dispute is that the hydrogen fuel cell dream is all but dead for the passenger vehicle market .",

  "/wiki/Convertible": "A convertible , cabriolet or spyder/spider ( /\u02cck\u00e6brio\u028a\u02c8le\u026a/ ) is a passenger car that can be driven with or without a roof in place . The methods of retracting and storing the roof vary between models . A convertible allows an open-air driving experience , with the ability to provide a roof when required . Potential drawbacks of convertibles are reduced structural rigidity ( requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the effects of removing a car 's roof ) and cargo space . The majority of convertible roofs are a folding construction made from cloth . Other types of convertible roofs include retractable hardtops ( often constructed from metal or plastic ) and detachable hardtops ( where a metal or plastic roof is manually removed and often stored in the trunk ) .",
  "/wiki/Mazda_MX-5": "The Mazda MX-5 is a lightweight two-passenger roadster manufactured and marketed by Mazda with a front mid-engine , rear-wheel-drive layout . The convertible is marketed as the Mazda Roadster ( \u30de\u30c4\u30c0\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc , Matsuda R\u014ddosut\u0101 ) or Eunos Roadster ( \u30e6\u30fc\u30ce\u30b9\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc , Y\u016bnosu R\u014ddosut\u0101 ) in Japan , and as the Mazda MX-5 Miata ( /mi\u02c8\u0251\u02d0t\u0259/ ) in North America , where it is widely known as the Miata . Manufactured at Mazda 's Hiroshima plant , the MX-5 debuted in 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show and was conceived and executed under a tightly focused design credo , Jinba ittai ( \u4eba\u99ac\u4e00\u4f53 ) , meaning oneness of horse and rider . Widely noted for its small , light , technologically modern , dynamically balanced and minimally complex design , the MX-5 is the spiritual successor to 1950s and '60s Italian and British sports cars , prominently the Lotus Elan . Generations were internally designated with a two-letter code , beginning with the first generation , the NA . The second generation , ( NB ) , launched in 1998 for MY 1999 ; followed by the third generation ( NC ) in 2005 for MY 2006 , and the fourth generation ( ND ) in 2015 for MY 2016 ( along with ND2 being the designation for MY 2019 ) . As the best-selling two-seat convertible sports car in history , the MX-5 has been marketed globally , with production exceeding one million , as of early 2016 . The name miata derives from Old High German for reward . [ N 1 ]",
  "/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_2": "The Volkswagen Type 2 , known officially ( depending on body type ) as the Transporter , Kombi or Microbus , or , informally , as the Bus ( US ) or Camper ( UK ) , P\u00e3o de Forma ( Loaf of Bread ) ( Portugal ) is a forward control light commercial vehicle introduced in 1950 by the German automaker Volkswagen as its second car model . Following - and initially deriving from - Volkswagen 's first model , the Type 1 ( Beetle ) , it was given the factory designation Type 2 . As one of the forerunners of the modern cargo and passenger vans , the Type 2 gave rise to forward control competitors in the United States in the 1960s , including the Ford Econoline , the Dodge A100 , and the Chevrolet Corvair 95 Corvan , the latter adapting the rear-engine configuration of the Corvair car in the same manner in which the VW Type 2 adapted the Type 1 layout . European competition included the 1947-1981 Citro\u00ebn H Van , the 1959-1980 Renault Estafette ( both FF layout ) , and the 1953-1965 FR layout Ford Transit . Japanese manufacturers also introduced similar vehicles , such as the Nissan Caravan , Toyota LiteAce and Subaru Sambar . Like the Beetle , the van has received numerous nicknames worldwide , including the microbus , minibus , and , because of its popularity during the counterculture movement of the 1960s , Hippie van/bus has become its most popular . Brazil contained the last factory in the world that produced the T2 series of Type 2 , which ceased production on 31 December 2013 , due to the introduction of more stringent safety regulations in the country . This ( after the 2002 termination of its T3 successor in South Africa ) marked the end of the era of rear-engine Volkswagens , which originated in 1935 with their Type 1 prototypes ."
