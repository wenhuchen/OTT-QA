Section 125 of the new Australian Constitution provided that land , situated in New South Wales and at least 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Sydney , would be ceded to the new federal government . Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales , the Seat of Government Act 1908 was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region . The land was transferred to the Commonwealth by New South Wales in 1911 , creating the Australian Capital Territory , two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913 . It is unusual among Australian cities , being an entirely planned city outside of any state , similar to Washington , D.C. in the United States or Bras\u00edlia in Brazil . Following an international contest for the city 's design , a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913 . The Griffins ' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles , hexagons and triangles , and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory .

Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000 years , and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region , making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites . During his first Pacific voyage in 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia , making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area . In 1788 , the First Fleet of convicts , led by Arthur Phillip , founded Sydney as a British penal colony , the first European settlement in Australia . Phillip named the city Sydney in recognition of Thomas Townshend , 1st Viscount Sydney . Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842 .

Named in honour of Queen Adelaide , consort to King William IV , the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for the only freely-settled British province in Australia . Colonel William Light , one of Adelaide 's founding fathers , designed the city centre and chose its location close to the River Torrens , in the area originally inhabited by the Kaurna people and known as Tarndanyangga ( place of the red kangaroo ) . Light 's design , now listed as national heritage , set out the city centre in a grid layout , interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares , and entirely surrounded by parklands . Early colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers , in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities . Until the post-war era , it was Australia 's third-largest city . It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms , and became known as the City of Churches due to its diversity of faiths . Today , Adelaide is noted for its many festivals and sporting events , its food and wine , its coastline and hills , and its large defence and manufacturing sectors .

  "/wiki/Hobart": "Hobart ( /\u02c8ho\u028ab\u0251\u02d0rt/ ( listen ) ) is the capital and most populous city of the Australian island state of Tasmania . With a population of approximately 240,342 ( over 45% of Tasmania 's population ) , it is the least populated Australian state capital city , and second smallest if territories are taken into account ( after Darwin , Northern Territory ) . The city is located in the state 's south-east on the estuary of the River Derwent , making it the most southern of Australia 's capital cities . Its skyline is dominated by the 1,271-metre ( 4,170 ft ) Mount Wellington , and its harbour forms the second-deepest natural port in the world , with much of the city 's waterfront consisting of reclaimed land . The metropolitan area is often referred to as Greater Hobart , to differentiate it from the City of Hobart , one of the five local government areas that cover the city . Founded in 1804 as a British penal colony , Hobart is Australia 's second oldest capital city after Sydney , New South Wales . Prior to British settlement , the Hobart area had been occupied for possibly as long as 35,000 years , by the semi-nomadic Mouheneener tribe , a sub-group of the Nuennone , or South-East tribe . The descendants of these Aboriginal Tasmanians often refer to themselves as 'Palawa ' . Since its foundation , the city has expanded from the mouth of Sullivans Cove in a generally north-south direction along both banks of the River Derwent , from 22 km inland from the estuary at Storm Bay to the point where the river reverts to fresh water at Bridgewater . Penal transportation ended in the 1850s , after which the city experienced periods of growth and decline . The early 20th century saw an economic boom on the back of mining , agriculture and other primary industries , and the loss of men who served in the world wars was counteracted by an influx of immigration . Despite the rise in migration from Asia and other non-English speaking regions , Hobart 's population remains predominantly ethnically Anglo-Celtic , and has the highest percentage of Australian-born residents among Australia 's capital cities .",

Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia , with most of the metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain , a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp . The first areas settled were on the Swan River at Guildford , with the city 's central business district and port ( Fremantle ) both later founded downriver . Captain James Stirling founded Perth in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony . It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for several large mining operations . As part of Perth 's role as the capital of Western Australia , the state 's Parliament and Supreme Court are in the city , as is Government House , the residence of the Governor of Western Australia ."
