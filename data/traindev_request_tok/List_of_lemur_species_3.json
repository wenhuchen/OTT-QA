It weighs about 1 kg . The pelage differs significantly from other southeastern woolly lemurs in that it is primarily light reddish brown on most of the body and grey under the jaw and on the extremities . The pelage is thicker on the head than other eastern woolly lemurs .",
  "/wiki/Endangered": "An endangered species is a species which has been categorized as very likely to become extinct in the near future . Endangered ( EN ) , as categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List , is the second most severe conservation status for wild populations in the IUCN 's schema after Critically Endangered ( CR ) . In 2012 , the IUCN Red List featured 3,079 animal and 2,655 plant species as endangered ( EN ) worldwide . The figures for 1998 were 1,102 and 1,197 respectively . Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species : for example , forbidding hunting , restricting land development or creating protected areas . Population numbers , trends and species ' conservation status can be found at the lists of organisms by population .",
  "/wiki/Cleese's_woolly_lemur": "The Bemaraha woolly lemur ( Avahi cleesei ) , also known as Cleese 's woolly lemur , is a species of woolly lemur native to western Madagascar , named after John Cleese . The scientist who discovered the species named it after Cleese , star of Monty Python , mainly because of Cleese 's fondness for lemurs , as shown in Operation Lemur With John Cleese and Fierce Creatures , and his efforts at protecting and preserving them . The species was first discovered in 1990 by a team of scientists from Zurich University led by Urs Thalmann , but was n't formally described as a species until November 11 , 2005 . The diurnal animal weighs about 5-6 kilograms ( 11-13 lb ) , has brown skin with white regions on the rear and inside of the thighs and has a short damp nose , large plate eyes , and ears which hardly stand out from the skin . It typically has a strictly vegetarian diet of leaves and buds , living together in small families . The local population calls the species dadintsifaky , which means Grandfather of the sifaka , because it is similarly sized to sifakas , but more ponderous , heavyset and has ample greyish-brown fur . The habitat is limited to the Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve in western Madagascar , which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The animal is probably threatened with becoming extinct in the long run , since the size of the population is unknown so far and its habitat shrinks continuously .",
  "/wiki/Eastern_woolly_lemur": "The eastern woolly lemur ( Avahi laniger ) , also known as the eastern avahi or Gmelin 's woolly lemur , is a species of woolly lemur native to eastern Madagascar , where it lives in the wet tropical rainforest at low elevations along the eastern coast of the island or they can also inhabit the northern tip of the island with other species . The woolly lemur name refers to their thick , tightly-curled hair , whereas their generic name avahi refers to their high-pitched defensive call . The eastern woolly lemur almost has an owl-look with its large eyes , small rounded head , and ears that are mostly hidden . This nocturnal animal weighs 1.0-1.3 kg and reaches a length of 27-29 cm with a tail of 33-37 cm . Its diet consists mainly of leaves and buds with fruits , flowers , and bark . Eastern woolly lemurs live in monogamous pairs together with their offspring . The eastern woolly lemur 's breeding season ranges from March to May with the baby lemurs being born around August to September . Other lemur species that live in the same rainforests as eastern woolly lemur are the diademed sifaka ( Propithecus diadema ) and the red-bellied lemur ( Eulemur rubriventer ) . In southeastern rainforests , sympatric lemur species of A. meridionalis are the brown mouse lemur ( Microcebus rufus ) , the greater dwarf lemur ( Cheirogaleus major ) , the fat-tailed dwarf lemur ( Cheirogaleus medius ) and the collared brown lemur ( Eulemur collaris ) in Sainte Luce Forest , and the southern lesser bamboo lemur ( Hapalemur meridionalis ) in Mandena Forest . According to the study conducted in Diet and Behaviour of a Nocturnal Lemur , Avahi Laniger , in the Wild ( 1991 ) , a male lemur rarely interacts with more than one other individual when sleeping , traveling or grooming . At night , he would spend about 40% of the time with his partner either grooming or resting .",

  "/wiki/Silky_sifaka": "The silky sifaka ( Propithecus candidus ) is a large lemur characterized by long , silky , white fur . It has a very restricted range in northeastern Madagascar , where it is known locally as the simpona . It is one of the rarest mammals on Earth , and is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as one of the world 's 25 most critically endangered primates . The silky sifaka is one of nine sifaka species ( genus Propithecus ) , and one of four former subspecies of diademed sifaka ( P. diadema ) . Studies in 2004 and 2007 compared external proportions , genetics , and craniodental anatomy supporting full species status , which has generally been accepted . The silky sifaka has a variable social structure , and lives in groups of two to nine individuals . It spends most of its day feeding and resting , though it also devotes a considerable amount of time to social behaviors , such as playing and grooming , as well as travelling . Females occasionally take priority over males during feeding . Like other eastern sifakas , it consumes mainly leaves and seeds , but also fruit , flowers , and even soil on occasion . It is a seasonal breeder and only mates one day a year during the start of the rainy season . As with other sifaka species , nonmaternal infant care is common . Group members of all ages and both sexes often groom , play with , occasionally carry , and even nurse infants that are not their own .",

From a very wealthy family , at the age of 20 , he and his brother , Ernest Grandidier ( 1833-1912 ) , undertook a voyage around the world . At first they were led by the astronomer and physicist Pierre Jules C\u00e9sar Janssen ( 1824-1907 ) , but when Janssen fell sick and had to return to France after about six months , the brothers continued the journey . They visited South America in 1858 and 1859 and in particular the Andes , Peru , Chile , Bolivia , Argentina and Brazil . During this voyage they gathered a significant collection of specimens which were analyzed , in 1860 , by Ernest . The two brothers parted ways after this . Ernest Grandidier went to China and collected a vast number of specimens which are now in the Louvre and the Guimet museum . Alfred travelled to India , reaching it in 1863 . He had intended to explore the high plateau of Tibet , but was prevented by a severe attack of fever . Grandidier travelled to Zanzibar to recuperate , remaining some time and making important collections and publishing an account of his findings .

Like all sifakas , it is a vertical clinger and leaper , and its diet includes mostly seeds and leaves . The golden-crowned sifaka is named after its discoverer , Ian Tattersall , who first spotted the species in 1974 . However , it was not formally described until 1988 , after a research team led by Elwyn L. Simons observed and captured some specimens for captive breeding . The golden-crowned sifaka most closely resembles the western forest sifakas of the P. verreauxi group , yet its karyotype suggests a closer relationship with the P. diadema group of eastern forest sifakas . Despite the similarities with both groups , more recent studies of its karyotype support its classification as a distinct species . Found in gallery , deciduous , and semi-evergreen forest , its restricted range includes 44 forest fragments , totaling an area of 44,125 hectares ( 109,040 acres ; 170.37 sq mi ) , centered on the town of Daraina in northeast Madagascar . Its estimated population is 18,000 individuals . It is primarily active during the day , although it also tends to be active at dawn and dusk during the rainy season .

Its fur is thick and silky and generally white with brown on the sides , top of the head , and on the arms . Like all sifakas , it has a long tail that it uses as a balance when leaping from tree to tree . However , its body is so highly adapted to an arboreal existence , on the ground its only means of locomotion is hopping . The species lives in small troops which forage for food . Four subspecies of this lemur are described . Many things are unknown about Verreaux 's sifaka , so their lifespan in the wild has not been approximated , but in captivity , they generally live to up to 18 years old . [ citation needed ]"
