Llamas are very social animals and live with others as a herd . Their wool is very soft and lanolin-free . Llamas can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions . When using a pack , they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km ( 5-8 miles ) . The name llama ( in the past also spelled lama or glama ) was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians . Llamas appear to have originated from the central plains of North America about 40 million years ago . They migrated to South America about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange . By the end of the last ice age ( 10,000-12,000 years ago ) , camelids were extinct in North America . As of 2007 , there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in South America , and due to importation from South America in the late 20th century , there are now over 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas in the United States and Canada .",
