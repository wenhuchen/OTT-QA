From 1939 to 1945 , following its forced division and partial incorporation into Nazi Germany , the state did not de facto exist but its government-in-exile continued to operate . From 1948 to 1990 , Czechoslovakia was part of the Eastern Bloc with a command economy . Its economic status was formalized in membership of Comecon from 1949 and its defense status in the Warsaw Pact of May 1955 . A period of political liberalization in 1968 , known as the Prague Spring , was forcibly ended when the Soviet Union , assisted by several other Warsaw Pact countries , invaded Czechoslovakia . In 1989 , as Marxist-Leninist governments and socialism were ending all over Europe , Czechoslovaks peacefully deposed their government in the Velvet Revolution ; state price controls were removed after a period of preparation . In 1993 , Czechoslovakia split into the two sovereign states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia .",
  "/wiki/Loves_of_a_Blonde": "Loves of a Blonde ( Czech : L\u00e1sky jedn\u00e9 plavovl\u00e1sky ) , also known as A Blonde in Love , is a 1965 Czechoslovak ensemble comedy film directed by Milo\u0161 Forman that follows a young woman , Andula , who has a routine job in a shoe factory in provincial Czechoslovakia , and her attempts at forging a romantic relationship . Forman based his story on a real-world incident from his past and the filmmakers focused much of their attention on trying to create a real-life look and feel by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own , utilizing a largely non-professional cast , relying on a considerable amount of dialogue improvisation , and employing documentary-style cinematographic techniques . Upon its release , Loves of a Blonde was a popular success in its home country and was shown at some major film festivals , where it was well-received , garnering a number of nominations and awards . Critical response was largely positive , although some reviewers were less enthusiastic than others . The film is now considered one of the most significant examples of the Czech New Wave , a movement which took advantage of a temporary relaxation of totalitarian control over creative artists to use cinema as a means to explore new narrative strategies while making pointed critiques of social and political conditions behind the Iron Curtain . Loves of a Blonde was nominated for the 1966 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film .",

Spoken by over 10 million people , it serves as the official language of the Czech Republic . Czech is closely related to Slovak , to the point of mutual intelligibility to a very high degree , as well as Polish . Like other Slavic languages , Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology and relatively flexible word order . Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin and German . The Czech-Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period , and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech-Slovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period . In the later 18th to mid-19th century , the modern written standard became codified in the context of the Czech National Revival . The main non-standard variety , known as Common Czech , is based on the vernacular of Prague , but is now spoken as an interdialect throughout most of the Czech Republic . The Moravian dialects spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech , although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak . Czech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory , comprising ten monophthongs , three diphthongs and 25 consonants ( divided into hard , neutral and soft categories ) . Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether . Czech has a raised alveolar trill , which is known to occur as a phoneme in only a few other languages , represented by the grapheme \u0159. Czech uses a simple orthography which phonologists have used as a model .",

Also , minor Danish-speaking communities are found in Norway , Sweden , Spain , the United States , Canada , Brazil , and Argentina . Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas , around 15-20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their first language . Along with the other North Germanic languages , Danish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples who lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . Danish , together with Swedish , derives from the East Norse dialect group , while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic . A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish as mainland Scandinavian , while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as insular Scandinavian . Until the 16th century , Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions . With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing , a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect . It spread through use in the education system and administration , though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century . Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden , a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity , and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity , with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries . Today , traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared , though regional variants of the standard language exist . The main differences in language are between generations , with youth language being particularly innovative .",

Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

During the Middle Ages , Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe , especially in science , mathematics and philosophy . As a result , many European languages have also borrowed many words from it . Arabic influence , mainly in vocabulary , is seen in European languages - mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese and Catalan - owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and almost 800 years of Arabic culture and language presence in the Iberian Peninsula , referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus .

It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language , spanning at least 3,500 years of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic , and many other writing systems . The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics . During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world , West Asia and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , Greek is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , and Turkey and by the Greek diaspora . Greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages ; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary .",

The group includes the Beijing dialect , the basis of Standard Chinese or Standard Mandarin .

Many local Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible . Nevertheless , Mandarin is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers ( with nearly a billion ) . Mandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups , spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area , stretching from Yunnan in the southwest to Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang in the northeast . This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the North China Plain compared to the more mountainous south , combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas . Most Mandarin varieties have four tones . The final stops of Middle Chinese have disappeared in most of these varieties , but some have merged them as a final glottal stop . Many Mandarin varieties , including the Beijing dialect , retain retroflex initial consonants , which have been lost in southern varieties of Chinese . The capital has been within the Mandarin area for most of the last millennium , making these dialects very influential .

During the Heian period ( 794-1185 ) , Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese . Late Middle Japanese ( 1185-1600 ) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language , and the first appearance of European loanwords . The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo ( modern Tokyo ) region in the Early Modern Japanese period ( early 17th century-mid-19th century ) . Following the end of Japan 's self-imposed isolation in 1853 , the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly . English loanwords , in particular , have become frequent , and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated . Japanese is an agglutinative , mora-timed language with simple phonotactics , a pure vowel system , phonemic vowel and consonant length , and a lexically significant pitch-accent . Word order is normally subject-object-verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words , and sentence structure is topic-comment .",

The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo , which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time , ruling most of the Korean Peninsula , Manchuria , parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia under Gwanggaeto the Great . Its capital , Seoul , is a major global city and half of South Korea 's over 51 million people live in the Seoul Capital Area , the fourth largest metropolitan economy in the world . The Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period . Its first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century BC . Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century , Korea was ruled by the Goryeo dynasty ( 918-1392 ) and the Joseon dynasty ( 1392-1897 ) . The succeeding Korean Empire was annexed into the Empire of Japan in 1910 . After World War II , Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S.-administered zones , with the latter becoming the Republic of Korea in August 1948 . In 1950 , a North Korean invasion began the Korean War and after its end in 1953 , the country 's economy began to soar , recording the fastest rise in average GDP per capita in the world between 1980 and 1990 . Authoritarian rule ended in 1987 and the country is now the most advanced democracy with the highest level of press freedom in Asia .

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas .

They move to a cottage , where Alma cares for Elisabet , confides in her and begins having trouble distinguishing herself from her patient . Characterized by elements of psychological horror , Persona has been the subject of much critical analysis , interpretation and debate . The film 's exploration of duality , insanity and personal identity has been interpreted as reflecting the Jungian theory of persona and dealing with issues related to filmmaking , vampire mythology , lesbianism , motherhood , abortion and other subjects . The experimental style of its prologue and storytelling has also been noted . The enigmatic film has been called the Mount Everest of cinematic analysis ; according to film historian Peter Cowie , Everything one says about Persona may be contradicted ; the opposite will also be true . [ n 2 ] Bergman wrote Persona with Ullmann and Andersson in mind for the lead roles and the idea of exploring their identities , and shot the film in Stockholm and F\u00e5r\u00f6 in 1965 . In production , the filmmakers experimented with effects , using smoke and a mirror to frame one scene and combining the lead characters ' faces in post-production for one shot .

It is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Danish , although the degree of mutual intelligibility is largely dependent on the dialect and accent of the speaker . Written Norwegian and Danish are usually more easily understood by Swedish speakers than the spoken languages , due to the differences in tone , accent and intonation . Swedish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . It has the most speakers of the North Germanic languages . Standard Swedish , spoken by most Swedes , is the national language that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established by the beginning of the 20th century . While distinct regional varieties descending from the older rural dialects still exist , the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized . The standard word order is , as in most Germanic languages , V2 , which means that the finite verb ( V ) appears in the second position ( 2 ) of a declarative main clause . Swedish morphology is similar to English ; that is , words have comparatively few inflections . Swedish has two genders and is generally seen to have two grammatical cases - nominative and genitive ( except for pronouns that , as in English , also are inflected in the object form ) - although it is debated if the genitive in Swedish should be seen as a genitive case or just the nominative plus the so-called genitive s , then seen as a clitic . Swedish has two grammatical numbers - plural and singular . Adjectives have discrete comparative and superlative forms and are also inflected according to gender , number and definiteness .",

It is a pluricentric language with four mutually intelligible standard varieties . South Slavic languages historically formed a continuum . The turbulent history of the area , particularly due to expansion of the Ottoman Empire , resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences . Due to population migrations , Shtokavian became the most widespread language in the western Balkans , intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by Chakavian and Kajkavian ( which further blend into Slovenian in the northwest ) . Bosniaks , Croats and Serbs differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles , although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign overlords . During that period , the language was referred to under a variety of names , such as Slavic in general or Serbian , Croatian or Bosnian in particular . In a classicizing manner , it was also referred to as Illyrian . The process of linguistic standardization of Serbo-Croatian was originally initiated in the mid-19th-century Vienna Literary Agreement by Croatian and Serbian writers and philologists , decades before a Yugoslav state was established . From the very beginning , there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards , although both were based on the same dialect of Shtokavian , Eastern Herzegovinian . In the 20th century , Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia ( when it was called Serbo-Croato-Slovenian ) , and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . The breakup of Yugoslavia affected language attitudes , so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines .",
