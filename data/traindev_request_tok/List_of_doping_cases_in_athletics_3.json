He competed for Clemson University in 1984 , later transferring to the University of Texas , Arlington . He was banned for doping in June 1986 after failing a drug test , which he appealed . His appeal was rejected and he served an 18-month suspension from the Canadian Track and Field Association . He testified in April 1989 at the Canadian government 's inquiry into drug use by athletes that he had been on muscle-building drugs since 1983 but that he appealed the June 1986 drug test because it indicated that he and two teammates used a specific substance they had not taken . He also stated that it was widespread among athletes at the University of Texas , Arlington which he attended . He also claimed he was reinstated by the Canadian Track and Field Assn . only after he threatened to expose anabolic steroid use by sprinter Ben Johnson and other athletes . He spoke with Steve Findlay , an athletes ' representative at the CTFA in Ottawa ; I threatened to turn in the world 's fastest human being , Dajia said .

  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

Slovakia 's territory spans about 49,000 square kilometres ( 19,000 sq mi ) and is mostly mountainous . The population is over 5.6 million and consists mostly of Slovaks . The capital and largest city is Bratislava , and the second-largest city is Ko\u0161ice . The official language is Slovak . The Slavs arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries . In the 7th century they played a significant role in the creation of Samo 's Empire and in the 9th century established the Principality of Nitra , which was later conquered by the Principality of Moravia to establish Great Moravia . In the 10th century , after the dissolution of Great Moravia , the territory was integrated into the Principality of Hungary , which would become the Kingdom of Hungary in 1000 . In 1241 and 1242 , much of the territory was destroyed by the Mongols during their invasion of Central and Eastern Europe . The area was recovered largely thanks to B\u00e9la IV of Hungary who also settled Germans who became an important ethnic group in the area , especially in what are today parts of central and eastern Slovakia .

  "/wiki/Nandrolone": "Nandrolone , also known as 19-nortestosterone , is an androgen and anabolic steroid ( AAS ) which is used in the form of esters such as nandrolone decanoate ( brand name Deca-Durabolin ) and nandrolone phenylpropionate ( brand name Durabolin ) . Nandrolone esters are used in the treatment of anemias , cachexia ( wasting syndrome ) , osteoporosis , breast cancer , and for other indications . They are not used by mouth and instead are given by injection into muscle or fat . Side effects of nandrolone esters include symptoms of masculinization like acne , increased hair growth , voice changes , and increased sexual desire . They are synthetic androgens and anabolic steroids and hence are agonists of the androgen receptor ( AR ) , the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) . Nandrolone esters have strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects , which give them a mild side effect profile and make them especially suitable for use in women and children . They are long-lasting prodrugs of nandrolone in the body . Nandrolone esters were first described and introduced for medical use in the late 1950s . They are among the most widely used AAS worldwide . In addition to their medical use , nandrolone esters are used to improve physique and performance , and are said to be the most widely used AAS for such purposes . The drugs are controlled substances in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit .",

It was commonly used in prescription and over-the-counter cough and cold preparations . In veterinary medicine , it is used to control urinary incontinence in dogs . PPA is also known as \u03b2-hydroxyamphetamine , and is a member of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes . It is closely related to the cathinones ( \u03b2-ketoamphetamines ) . The compound exists as four stereoisomers , which include d- and l-norephedrine and d- and l-norpseudoephedrine . d-Norpseudoephedrine is also known as cathine , and is found naturally in Catha edulis ( khat ) . Pharmaceutical drug preparations of PPA have varied in their stereoisomer composition in different countries , which may explain differences in misuse and side effect profiles . Analogues of PPA include ephedrine , pseudoephedrine , amphetamine , methamphetamine , and cathinone . Although originally thought to act as a direct agonist of adrenergic receptors , PPA was subsequently found to show only weak or negligible affinity for these receptors , and has been instead characterized as an indirect sympathomimetic which acts by inducing norepinephrine release and thereby activating adrenergic receptors . It was patented in 1938 . In the United States , PPA is no longer sold due to a purported increased risk of stroke in younger women .",

  "/wiki/Testosterone": "Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid . In male humans , testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate , as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass , and the growth of body hair . In addition , testosterone is involved in health and well-being , and the prevention of osteoporosis . Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss . Testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a keto and hydroxyl groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively . It is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites . It exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor . In humans and most other vertebrates , testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and , to a lesser extent , the ovaries of females . On average , in adult males , levels of testosterone are about 7 to 8 times as great as in adult females . As the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced , the daily production is about 20 times greater in men . Females are also more sensitive to the hormone . In addition to its role as a natural hormone , testosterone is used as a medication in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men , transgender hormone therapy for transgender men , and breast cancer in women .",

It is on the list of substances prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency since it is a detectable metabolite of nandrolone , an anabolic-androgenic steroid ( AAS ) . Consumption of androstendione products contaminated with traces of bolandione may also result in testing positive for nandrolone . Traces of 19-norandrosterone may be naturally present in human urine . An experiment conducted on athletes showed that after a prolonged intense effort , the 19-norandrosterone concentration can be increased by a factor varying between 2 and 4 , but another study failed to replicate the result . Concentration also increases in the urine of female athletes during menstruation . The consumption of edible parts of a non-castrated pig , containing 19-nortestosterone , has been shown to result in the excretion of 19-norandrosterone in the following hours , so athletes should prudently avoid meals composed of pig offal in the hours preceding doping tests .

Low levels of EPO ( around 10 mU/mL ) are constantly secreted sufficient to compensate for normal red blood cell turnover . Common causes of cellular hypoxia resulting in elevated levels of EPO ( up to 10 000 mU/mL ) include any anemia , and hypoxemia due to chronic lung disease . Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney in close association with the peritubular capillary and proximal convoluted tubule . It is also produced in perisinusoidal cells in the liver . Liver production predominates in the fetal and perinatal period ; renal production predominates in adulthood . It is homologous with thrombopoietin . Exogenous erythropoietin , recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhEPO ) , is produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture and are collectively called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESA ) : two examples are epoetin alfa and epoetin beta . ESAs are used in the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease , anemia in myelodysplasia , and in anemia from cancer chemotherapy . Risks of therapy include death , myocardial infarction , stroke , venous thromboembolism , and tumor recurrence . Risk increases when EPO treatment raises hemoglobin levels over 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL : this is to be avoided . rhEPO has been used illicitly as a performance-enhancing drug .",

The area of the Republic of Cuba is 110,860 square kilometers ( 42,800 sq mi ) ( 109,884 square kilometers ( 42,426 sq mi ) without the territorial waters ) . The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean , with an area of 105,006 square kilometers ( 40,543 sq mi ) , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola , with over 11 million inhabitants . The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century . From the 15th century , it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898 , when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 . As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro . Since 1965 , the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba . The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .",

East Thrace , the part of Turkey in Europe , is separated from Anatolia by the Sea of Marmara , the Bosporus and the Dardanelles ( collectively called the Turkish Straits ) . Istanbul , mostly located on the European side , is the largest city in the country while Ankara is the capital . Turkey is bordered by Greece and Bulgaria to its northwest , the Black Sea to its north , Georgia to its northeast , Armenia , the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to its east , Iraq and Syria to its southeast , the Mediterranean Sea to its south , and the Aegean Sea to its west . Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power .",
  "/wiki/Metenolone": "Metenolone , or methenolone , is an androgen and anabolic steroid ( AAS ) which is used in the form of esters such as metenolone acetate ( brand name Primobolan , Nibal ) and metenolone enanthate ( brand name Primobolan Depot , Nibal Injection ) . Metenolone esters are used mainly in the treatment of anemia due to bone marrow failure . Metenolone acetate is taken by mouth , while metenolone enanthate is given by injection into muscle . Side effects of metenolone esters include symptoms of masculinization like acne , increased hair growth , voice changes , and increased sexual desire . Metenolone esters are synthetic androgens and anabolic steroids and hence are agonists of the androgen receptor ( AR ) , the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) . They have moderate anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects , as well as no estrogenic effects or risk of liver damage . Metenolone esters are androgen esters and prodrugs of metenolone in the body . Metenolone esters were introduced for medical use in the early 1960s . In addition to their medical use , metenolone esters are used to improve physique and performance . The drugs are controlled substances in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit . They have mostly been discontinued for medical use and have limited availability .",
