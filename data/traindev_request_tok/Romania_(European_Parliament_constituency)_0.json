  "/wiki/Political_groups_of_the_European_Parliament": "The political groups of the European Parliament are the parliamentary groups of the European Parliament . The European Parliament is unique among supranational assemblies in that its members ( MEPs ) organise themselves into ideological groups as in traditional national legislatures . The members of other supranational assemblies form national groups . The political groups of the European Parliament are usually the formal representation of a European political party in the Parliament . In other cases , they are political coalitions of a number of European parties , national parties , and independent politicians . The political groups of the European Parliament are strictly forbidden to campaign during the European elections since this is the exclusive responsibility of the European political parties . Each political group is assumed to have a set of core principles , and political groups that can not demonstrate this may be disbanded ( see below ) .",

  "/wiki/Greater_Romania_Party": "The Greater Romania Party ( Romanian : Partidul Rom\u00e2nia Mare , PRM ) is a Romanian nationalist political party . Founded in May 1991 by Eugen Barbu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor , it was led by the latter from that point until his death in September 2015 . The party is sometimes referred to in English as the Great Romania Party . It briefly participated in government from 1993 to 1995 ( in Nicolae V\u0103c\u0103roiu 's cabinet ) . In 2000 , Tudor received the second largest number of votes in Romania 's presidential elections , partially as a result of protest votes lodged by Romanians frustrated with the fractionalisation and mixed performance of the 1996-2000 Romanian Democratic Convention government . Tudor 's second-place position ensured he would compete in the second round run-off against former president and Party of Social Democracy in Romania ( PDSR ) candidate Ion Iliescu , who won by a large margin . Parallels are often drawn with the situation in France two years later , when far-right Front National Party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen similarly drew the second largest number of votes and was elevated , but defeated , in the presidential run-off against Jacques Chirac . Although Tudor clearly remained the central figure in the PRM , in March 2005 he briefly stepped down from the party presidency in favour of Corneliu Ciontu . A primary objective of the move was to provide the appearance of a shift toward the political center and to attempt to align PRM with the European People 's Party ( EPP ) bloc in the European Parliament . During this period the PRM also briefly changed its name to the Greater Romania 's People Party . EPP , however , rejected the PRM as a potential member . Tudor stated he refused to join the EPP because of its lack of identity .",
