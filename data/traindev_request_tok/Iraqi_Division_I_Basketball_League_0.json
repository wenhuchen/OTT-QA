Located along the Tigris River , the city was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate . Within a short time of its inception , Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural , commercial , and intellectual center of the Muslim world . This , in addition to housing several key academic institutions , including the House of Wisdom , as well as hosting a multiethnic and multireligious environment , garnered the city a worldwide reputation as the Centre of Learning . Baghdad was the largest city in the world for much of the Abbasid era during the Islamic Golden Age , peaking at a population of more than a million . The city was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258 , resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires . With the recognition of Iraq as an independent state ( formerly the British Mandate of Mesopotamia ) in 1932 , Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arabic culture , with a population variously estimated at 6 or over 7 million . [ note 1 ] In contemporary times , the city has often faced severe infrastructural damage , most recently due to the United States-led 2003 invasion of Iraq , and the subsequent Iraq War that lasted until December 2011 . In recent years , the city has been frequently subjected to insurgency attacks . The war had resulted in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts as well . As of 2018 [ update ] , Baghdad was listed as one of the least hospitable places in the world to live , ranked by Mercer as the worst major city for quality of life in the world .",

It is situated in a predominantly agricultural region which is extensively irrigated with water provided by the Hilla canal , producing a wide range of crops , fruit and textiles . Its name may be derived from the word beauty in Arabic . The river runs exactly in the middle of the town , and it is surrounded by date palm trees and other forms of arid vegetation , reducing the harmful effects of dust and desert wind . The city was once a major center of Islamic scholarship and education . The tomb of the Jewish prophet Ezekiel is reputed to be located in a nearby village , Al Kifl . It became a major administrative centre during the rule of the Ottoman and British Empires . In the 19th century , the Hilla branch of the Euphrates started to silt up and much agricultural land was lost to drought , but this process was reversed by the construction of the Hindiya Barrage in 1911-1913 , which diverted water from the deeper Hindiya branch of the Euphrates into the Hilla canal . It saw heavy fighting in 1920 during an uprising against the British , when 300 men of the Manchester Regiment were apparently defeated in the city . [ citation needed ]",
