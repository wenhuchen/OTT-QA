As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",

The district stretches from Herndon to Quantico , comprising most of Fairfax County , all of the city of Fairfax , and part of eastern Prince William County . The residents of the 11th district are represented by Democrat Gerry Connolly . The Hill newspaper quotes census data to conclude that Virginia 's 11th district was the wealthiest congressional district in the nation from 2003 to 2013 . The article attributed the wealth to the many lobbyists and two-career couples in Northern Virginia . The district last existed in what is now West Virginia 's 1st District and was held by Jacob B. Blair before the events of the U.S. Civil War . Virginia did not have an 11th District until it was re-created after the 1990 United States Census from portions of the old 8th and 10th districts because of explosive growth in Northern Virginia . It was intended to be a fair fight district ; indeed , it encompassed most of the more Democratic portions of the old 10th District and the more Republican portions of the old 8th District . George W. Bush only narrowly defeated John Kerry here in 2004 , while Democratic Governor Tim Kaine and Democratic Senator Jim Webb both carried this district , in 2005 and 2006 respectively . In 2008 , Barack Obama won this district over Republican Senator John McCain . Democrat Leslie L. Byrne briefly held the seat for the first election cycle of the new district , but was quickly defeated in 1994 by Republican Tom Davis .
