  "/wiki/Richie_Ashburn": "Donald Richard Ashburn ( March 19 , 1927 - September 9 , 1997 ) , also known by the nicknames , Putt-Putt , The Tilden Flash , and Whitey ( due to his light-blond hair ) , was an American center fielder in Major League Baseball . ( Some sources give his full middle name as Richie . ) He was born in Tilden , Nebraska . From his youth on a farm , he grew up to become a professional outfielder and veteran broadcaster for the Philadelphia Phillies and one of the most beloved sports figures in Philadelphia history . He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1995 .",
  "/wiki/Outfielder": "An outfielder is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions in baseball or softball , farthest from the batter . These defenders are the left fielder , the center fielder , and the right fielder . As an outfielder , their duty is to catch fly balls and/ ground balls then to return them to the infield for the out or before the runner advances , if there is any runners on the bases . As an outfielder , they normally play behind the six players located in the field . By convention , each of the nine defensive positions in baseball is numbered . The outfield positions are 7 ( left field ) , 8 ( center field ) and 9 ( right field ) . These numbers are shorthand designations useful in baseball scorekeeping and are not necessarily the same as the squad numbers worn on player uniforms . Outfielders named to the MLB All-Century Team are Hank Aaron , Ty Cobb , Joe DiMaggio , Mickey Mantle , Willie Mays , Stan Musial , Pete Rose , Babe Ruth , Ted Williams and Ken Griffey Jr .",
  "/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)": "In baseball , the batting average ( BA ) is the number of hits divided by at bats . It is usually rounded to three decimal places and read without the decimal : A player with a batting average of .300 is batting three-hundred . If necessary to break ties , batting averages could be taken beyond the .001 measurement . In this context , .001 is considered a point , such that a .235 batter is 5 points higher than a .230 batter .",
  "/wiki/Triple_(baseball)": "In baseball , a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball , with neither the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) nor another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A triple is sometimes called a three-bagger or three-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 3B . Triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball . It often requires a ball hit to a distant part of the field , or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield . It also usually requires that the batter hit the ball solidly , and be a speedy runner . It also often requires that the batter 's team have a good strategic reason for wanting the batter on third base , as a double will already put the batter in scoring position and there will often be little strategic advantage to taking the risk of trying to stretch a double into a triple . ( The inside-the-park home run is much rarer than a triple ) . The trend for modern ballparks is to have smaller outfields ( often increasing the number of home runs ) ; it has ensured that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of those who played early in Major League Baseball history , generally in the dead-ball era . A walk-off triple ( one that ends a game ) occurs very infrequently . For example , the 2016 MLB season saw only three walk-off triples , excluding one play that was actually a triple plus an error .",
  "/wiki/Stolen_base": "In baseball , a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner . The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base , but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10 . A stolen base most often occurs when a base runner advances to the next base while the pitcher is pitching the ball to home plate . Successful base stealers are not only fast but have good baserunning instincts and timing .",
  "/wiki/Johnny_Blatnik": "John Louis Blatnik ( March 10 , 1921 - January 21 , 2004 ) was an American outfielder in Major League Baseball who played from 1948 through 1950 for the Philadelphia Phillies ( 1948-1950 ) and St. Louis Cardinals ( 1950 ) . Listed at 6 ft ( 1.8 m ) , 195 lb ( 88 kg ) , Blatnik batted and threw right-handed . He was born in Bridgeport , Ohio . Known as a line-drive hitter and a strong-armed outfielder , Blatnik was the regular left fielder for the 1948 Phillies . He appeared in a career-high 121 games while batting .260 with 41 extra-base hits that season , and he also led the National League outfielders with nine assists . However , injuries cut short his career , and Blatnik appeared in just 28 games over the next two years . He began the 1950 campaign with the eventual NL champion Phillies Whiz Kids , but was traded to the Cardinals for left-handed pitcher Ken Johnson on April 27 after only four games played with Philadelphia . He was sent to the minor leagues by the Cardinals after only seven more games and 23 plate appearances . In a three-season Major League career , Blatnik was .253 hitter , with 113 hits , six home runs and 46 RBI in 138 games , including 59 runs , 27 double , eight triples , three stolen bases , and a .317 on-base percentage . Blatnik died in Lansing , Ohio , at the age of 82 and was buried nearby in Holly Memorial Gardens .",

  "/wiki/At-bat": "In baseball , an at bat ( AB ) or time at bat is a batter 's turn batting against a pitcher . An at bat is different from a plate appearance . A batter is credited with a plate appearance regardless of what happens during their turn at bat , but a batter is credited with an at bat only if that plate appearance does not have one of the results enumerated below . While at bats are used to calculate certain statistics , including batting average and slugging percentage , a player can qualify for the season-ending rankings in these categories only if they accumulate 502 plate appearances during the season . A batter will not receive credit for an at bat if their plate appearance ends under the following circumstances :",
  "/wiki/Plate_appearance": "In baseball statistics , a player is credited with a plate appearance ( denoted by PA ) each time he completes a turn batting . Under Rule 5.04 ( c ) of the Official Baseball Rules , a player completes a turn batting when he is put out or becomes a runner . This happens when he strikes out or is declared out before reaching first base ; or when he reaches first base safely or is awarded first base ( by a base on balls , hit by pitch , catcher 's interference , or obstruction ) ; or when he hits a fair ball which causes a preceding runner to be put out for the third out before he himself is put out or reaches first base safely ( see also left on base , fielder 's choice , force play ) . A very similar statistic , at bats , counts a subset of plate appearances that end under certain circumstances .",

  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball , second baseman is a fielding position in the infield , between second and first base . The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet , needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly , and must be able to make the pivot on a double play . In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950 . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well .",
  "/wiki/Double_(baseball)": "In baseball , a double is the act of a batter striking the pitched ball and safely reaching second base without being called out by the umpire , without the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) or another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A double is a type of hit ( the others being the single , triple and home run ) and is sometimes called a two-bagger or two-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 2B .",
  "/wiki/Runs_batted_in": "A run batted in ( RBI ) , plural runs batted in ( RBI or RBIs ) , is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored ( except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play ) . For example , if the batter bats a base hit , then another player on a higher base can head home to score a run , and the batter gets credited with batting in that run . Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season , runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic . Nevertheless , the RBI statistic was tabulated - unofficially - from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan , according to the Society for American Baseball Research . Common nicknames for an RBI include ribby ( or ribbie ) , rib , and ribeye . The plural of RBI is generally RBIs , although some commentators use RBI as both singular and plural , as it can also stand for runs batted in .",

From 1942 through 1951 , Borowy played for the New York Yankees ( 1942-45 ) , Chicago Cubs ( 1945-48 ) , Philadelphia Phillies ( 1949-50 ) , Pittsburgh Pirates ( 1950 ) and Detroit Tigers ( 1950-51 ) . He batted and threw right-handed . Born in Bloomfield , New Jersey , Borowy graduated from Bloomfield High School and Fordham University . He pitched in six World Series games and posted a 108-82 record with 690 strikeouts and a 3.50 earned run average ( ERA ) in 1,717 innings . Borowy debuted on April 18 , 1942 with the Yankees , finishing with a 15-4 record , 85 strikeouts and a 2.82 ERA . He started Game 4 of the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals and did not receive a decision . In 1943 , Borowy went 14-9 with 107 strikeouts and a 2.82 ERA and won Game 3 of the World Series against St. Louis . Named an All-Star in 1944 , he pitched three scoreless innings in the game , ending the season with a 17-12 record , 107 strikeouts and a 2.64 ERA . In 1945 Borowy posted a 10-5 record with the Yankees in the first half of the season . The 1945 All Star game was cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions , but Borowy was selected a virtual All Star in an unofficial poll of managers conducted by the Associated Press . At the All-Star break he was placed on waivers by the Yankees , and eventually sold to the Cubs for $ 100,000 ( $ 1,420,148 in current dollar terms ) .",
  "/wiki/Pitcher": "In baseball , the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher 's mound toward the catcher to begin each play , with the goal of retiring a batter , who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the pitcher is assigned the number 1 . The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game , and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum . There are many different types of pitchers , such as the starting pitcher , relief pitcher , middle reliever , lefty specialist , setup man , and the closer . Traditionally , the pitcher also bats . Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter , a cause of some controversy . The National League in Major League Baseball and the Japanese Central League are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position .",
  "/wiki/Earned_run": "In baseball , an earned run is any run that was fully enabled by the offensive team 's production in the face of competent play from the defensive team . Conversely , an unearned run is a run that would not have been scored without the aid of an error or a passed ball committed by the defense . An unearned run counts just as much as any other run for the purpose of determining the score of the game . However , it is unearned in that it was , in a sense , given away by the defensive team . Both total runs and earned runs are tabulated as part of a pitcher 's statistics . However , earned runs are specially denoted because of their use in calculating a pitcher 's earned run average ( ERA ) , the number of earned runs allowed by the pitcher per nine innings pitched ( i.e. , averaged over a regulation game ) . Thus , in effect , the pitcher is held personally accountable for earned runs , while the responsibility for unearned runs is shared with the rest of the team . To determine whether a run is earned , the official scorer must reconstruct the inning as it would have occurred without errors or passed balls .",
  "/wiki/Innings_pitched": "In baseball , innings pitched ( IP ) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed , measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game . Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched . One out counts as one-third of an inning , and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning . Sometimes , the statistic is written 34.1 , 72.2 , or 91.0 , for example , to represent \u200b34 1\u20443 innings , \u200b72 2\u20443 innings , and 91 innings exactly , respectively . Runners left on base by a pitcher are not counted in determining innings pitched . It is possible for a pitcher to enter a game , give up several hits and possibly even several runs , and be removed before achieving any outs , thereby recording a total of zero innings pitched . Alternatively , it is possible for a pitcher to enter a situation where there are two runners on base and no outs . He 'll throw one pitch which will result in a triple play , and for that one pitch he 'll be credited with a full inning pitched .",

He was born in Athens , Illinois ; he was listed as 5 feet 11 inches ( 1.80 m ) tall and 175 pounds ( 79 kg ) . Brittin served in the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater of World War II and attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . His professional playing career extended from 1947 through 1954 . In 1949 , he won 21 gams for the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Class B Interstate League . He was recalled by the pennant-bound 1950 Phillies in September from Triple-A , and in his debut he pitched a scoreless inning in a marathon , 19-inning victory over the Cincinnati Reds . Cincinnati was ahead , 5-2 , when Brittin relieved Robin Roberts in the eighth . He retired the Reds in order , then was removed for a pinch hitter . The Phillies tied the game in the ninth , and then again in the 18th frame , and won it 8-7 in their half of the 19th .

  "/wiki/Relief_pitcher": "In baseball and softball , a relief pitcher or reliever is a pitcher who enters the game after the starting pitcher is removed due to injury , ineffectiveness , fatigue , ejection , or for other strategic reasons , such as inclement weather delays or pinch hitter substitutions . Relief pitchers are further divided informally into various roles , such as closers , setup men , middle relief pitchers , left/right-handed specialists , and long relievers . Whereas starting pitchers usually rest several days before pitching in a game again due to the number of pitches thrown , relief pitchers are expected to be more flexible and typically pitch more games but with fewer innings pitched .

During his rookie season , Church was playing a key role for the famed 1950 Whiz Kids Phillies in their fight for a pennant . He was an important member of a very young pitching staff , teaming with Robin Roberts , Curt Simmons , Bob Miller , and the dependable reliever Jim Konstanty . However , Church was struck in the face by a line drive off the bat of Cincinnati 's Ted Kluszewski . The ball was hit so hard that it caromed into right field on the fly . A week later , he was out on the mound again to face the hard-hitting Dodgers , but after the game his season was over , and he did not play in the 1950 World Series . He finished 1950 at 8-6 with an ERA of 2.73 and two shutouts in 142 innings .

  "/wiki/Starting_pitcher": "In baseball ( hardball or softball ) , a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team . A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent 's first batter of a game . Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game , although their ability to do this depends on many factors , including effectiveness , stamina , health , and strategy . A starting pitcher in professional baseball usually rests three , four , or five days after pitching a game before pitching another . Therefore , most professional baseball teams have four , five or six starting pitchers on their rosters . These pitchers , and the sequence in which they pitch , is known as the rotation . In modern baseball , a five-man rotation is most common . In contrast , a pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher . Occasionally , an opening pitcher is used for only a few innings , and is replaced by a long reliever or a pitcher who would typically be a starting pitcher .",
  "/wiki/Strikeout": "In baseball or softball , a strikeout ( or strike-out ) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat . It usually means the batter is out . A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",

A right-handed pitcher and lifelong resident of Olivia , Minnesota , Donnelly had an 18-year ( 1935-52 ) professional career and worked in 190 Major League games between 1944 and 1951 for the St. Louis Cardinals , Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Braves . He stood 5 feet 10 inches ( 1.78 m ) tall and weighed 166 pounds ( 75 kg ) . Donnelly spent nine seasons in minor league baseball ; in 1941 , he had 28 wins and 304 strikeouts for the Class C Springfield Cardinals of the Western Association . He was promoted to the Major Leagues and the St. Louis Cardinals as a 30-year-old rookie in 1944 . In 27 games , four as a starting pitcher , Donnelly posted a career-best 2.12 earned run average , won two of three decisions , and collected four saves as the Redbirds won their third successive National League championship . Donnelly then turned in two outstanding performances in relief in the All-St. Louis 1944 World Series . In his first outing , in Game 1 , he retired all six St. Louis Browns to face him , but the Browns held on for a 2-1 triumph . Then , in Game 2 , Donnelly relieved starting pitcher Max Lanier in the eighth inning of a 2-2 tie .

  "/wiki/Base_on_balls": "A base on balls ( BB ) , also known as a walk , occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls , and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out . The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball 's Official Rules , and further detail is given in 6.08 ( a ) . It is , however , considered a faux pas for a professional player to actually walk to first base ; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play . The term base on balls distinguishes a walk from the other manners in which a batter can be awarded first base without liability to be put out ( e.g. , hit by pitch ( HBP ) , catcher 's interference ) . Though a base on balls , catcher 's interference , or a batter hit by a pitched ball all result in the batter ( and possibly runners on base ) being awarded a base , the term walk usually refers only to a base on balls , and not the other methods of reaching base without the bat touching the ball . An important difference is that for a hit batter or catcher 's interference , the ball is dead and no one may advance unless forced ; the ball is live after a walk ( see below for details ) . A batter who draws a base on balls is commonly said to have been walked by the pitcher . When the batter is walked , runners advance one base without liability to be put out only if forced to vacate their base to allow the batter to take first base . If a batter draws a walk with the bases loaded , all preceding runners are forced to advance , including the runner on third base who is forced to home plate to score a run ; when a run is forced on a walk , the batter is credited with an RBI per rule 10.04 . Receiving a base on balls does not count as a hit or an at bat for a batter but does count as a time on base and a plate appearance . Therefore , a base on balls does not affect a player 's batting average , but it can increase his on-base percentage . A hit by pitch is not counted statistically as a walk , though the effect is mostly the same , with the batter receiving a free pass to first base .",

  "/wiki/Home_run": "In baseball , a home run ( abbreviated HR ) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process . In modern baseball , the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles ( or making contact with either foul pole ) without first touching the ground , resulting in an automatic home run . There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field . A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter , because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat . When a home run is scored , the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored , and an RBI for each runner that scores , including himself . Likewise , the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run , with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter . Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and , as a result , prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying , Home run hitters drive Cadillacs , and singles hitters drive Fords ( coined , circa 1948 , by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , by way of mentoring his young teammate , Ralph Kiner ) .",

An All-Star three years in a row , Hamner was the National League 's starting shortstop in the 1952 All-Star Game , played on his home field , Shibe Park , in Philadelphia . The game was called off after five innings due to rain . On May 16 , 1959 , Hamner was traded to Cleveland , but he batted only .164 for the remainder of the campaign . He then became a manager in the minor league system of the Kansas City Athletics , reappearing briefly with the A 's as a pitcher during the 1962 season ( he had dabbled on the mound for the 1956-57 Phillies ) . But the change did not prolong Hamner 's playing career .",
  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base .",

Listed at 6 feet 1 inch ( 1.85 m ) , 185 pounds ( 84 kg ) , he batted and threw left-handed . The native of Topeka , Kansas , served in World War II in the United States Army in the Pacific Theater of Operations , where he was a tank commander . Johnson was a hard-throwing pitcher but what he lacked in control he made up for in the velocity and movement of his pitches . His wildness impeded his career , though he had flashes of brilliance . Johnson entered the Majors in 1947 with the St. Louis Cardinals , playing for them in part of four seasons ( 1947-50 ) before joining the Philadelphia Phillies ( 1950-51 ) and Detroit Tigers ( 1952 ) .

He struggled with his control after that and was sent by St. Louis to the Phillies in exchange for outfielder Johnny Blatnik . He went 4-1 as a member of the famous Phillies Whiz Kids , on the way to the National League pennant . Although he did not pitch in the 1950 World Series , Johnson appeared as a pinch runner for Dick Sisler in the ninth inning of Game 4 , and scored the Phils ' last run of the Fall Classic on an error by New York Yankees leftfielder Gene Woodling .

  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty . Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast .",

  "/wiki/Closer_(baseball)": "In baseball , a closing pitcher , more frequently referred to as a closer ( abbreviated CL ) , is a relief pitcher who specializes in getting the final outs in a close game when his team is leading . The role is often assigned to a team 's best reliever . Before the 1990s , pitchers in similar roles were referred to as a fireman , short reliever , and stopper . A small number of closers have won the Cy Young Award . Eight closers have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame : Dennis Eckersley , Rollie Fingers , Goose Gossage , Trevor Hoffman , Mariano Rivera , Lee Smith , Bruce Sutter and Hoyt Wilhelm .",
  "/wiki/Save_(baseball)": "In baseball , a save ( abbreviated SV or S ) is credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances . Most commonly a pitcher earns a save by entering in the ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead . The number of saves or percentage of save opportunities successfully converted are oft-cited statistics of relief pitchers , particularly those in the closer role . The save statistic was created by journalist Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers and was adopted as an official MLB statistic in 1969 . The save has been retroactively measured for pitchers before that date . Mariano Rivera is MLB 's all-time leader in regular-season saves with 652 .",

  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player . When a batter takes his/her turn to hit , the catcher crouches behind home plate , in front of the ( home ) umpire , and receives the ball from the pitcher . In addition to this primary duty , the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well . The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket , but in cricket , wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities . Positioned behind home plate , the catcher can see the whole field , and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play . The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals . The calls are based on the pitcher 's mechanics and strengths , as well as the batter 's tendencies and weaknesses . Foul tips , bouncing balls in the dirt , and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher , necessitating the use of protective equipment . This includes a mask , chest and throat protectors , shin guards , and a heavily padded catcher 's mitt . Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game 's strategies , the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball , including such prominent examples as Connie Mack , Steve O'Neill , Al L\u00f3pez , Mike Scioscia , and Joe Torre . The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season , and can have a negative effect on their offensive output . Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching , if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills , teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses .",

His professional career lasted for 16 seasons , including 319 games pitched over all or part of 13 years in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs ( 1946-48 ; 1956 ) , Philadelphia Phillies ( 1949-52 ) , Brooklyn Dodgers ( 1953-55 ) , Cincinnati Redlegs ( 1956 ) , Boston Red Sox ( 1957 ) and Kansas City Athletics ( 1959 ) . The native of Peru , Illinois , was listed as 6 feet 1 inch ( 1.85 m ) tall and 175 pounds ( 79 kg ) . Initially signed by the Chicago White Sox as an amateur free agent in 1942 , Meyer spent 1943 performing United States Army service during World War II . While pitching for his camp team , Meyer was stricken with appendicitis , then contracted peritonitis ; he was given a medical discharge and released by the White Sox organization . He signed with the crosstown Cubs , spent three seasons in the Class A1 ( now Double-A ) Southern Association , and made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 13 , 1946 . Among his ten full big-league seasons , two stand out . In 1949 , as a Phillie , he won 17 of 25 decisions and posted a strong 3.08 earned run average , as Philadelphia finished in the National League 's first division for only the second time since World War I . Then , in his maiden campaign for the Dodgers in 1953 , he went 15-5 , for a sparkling .750 winning percentage . However , his ERA was a poor 4.56 and he surrendered 25 home runs in 191\u200b1\u20443 innings pitched - testimony to the Dodgers ' potent offense and the intimate dimensions of Ebbets Field , where Meyer 's earned run average was 5.28 . That season , Brooklyn won 105 games and its second consecutive National League pennant ."
