Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16 , 1907 . With ancient mountain ranges , prairie , mesas , and eastern forests , most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains , Cross Timbers , and the U.S . Interior Highlands , all regions prone to severe weather . Oklahoma is on a confluence of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives , a destination for Southern settlers , and a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans . More than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma . A major producer of natural gas , oil , and agricultural products , Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation , energy , telecommunications , and biotechnology . Both Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma 's primary economic anchors , with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas .",

The fair had been intended to be held in Moscow , to help the Soviet Union celebrate the Russian Revolution 's 50th anniversary ; however , for various reasons , the Soviets decided to cancel , and Canada was awarded it in late 1962 . The project was not well supported in Canada at first . It took the determination of Montreal 's mayor , Jean Drapeau , and a new team of managers to guide it past political , physical and temporal hurdles . Defying a computer analysis that said it could not be done , the fair opened on time . After Expo 67 ended in October 1967 , the site and most of the pavilions continued on as an exhibition called Man and His World , open during the summer months from 1968 until 1984 .
