Water slides differ in their riding method and therefore size . Some slides require riders to sit directly on the slide , or on a raft or tube designed to be used with the slide . A typical water slide uses a pump system to pump water to the top which is then allowed to freely flow down its surface . The water reduces friction so sliders travel down the slide very quickly . Water slides run into a swimming pool ( often called a plunge pool ) or a long run-out chute . A lifeguard is usually stationed at the top and the bottom of the slide , so that if a rider gets hurt they will be treated immediately .",

Water slides differ in their riding method and therefore size . Some slides require riders to sit directly on the slide , or on a raft or tube designed to be used with the slide . A typical water slide uses a pump system to pump water to the top which is then allowed to freely flow down its surface . The water reduces friction so sliders travel down the slide very quickly . Water slides run into a swimming pool ( often called a plunge pool ) or a long run-out chute . A lifeguard is usually stationed at the top and the bottom of the slide , so that if a rider gets hurt they will be treated immediately ."
