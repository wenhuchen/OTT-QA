The northerly latitude location also results in perpetual civil twilight during summer nights and very short winter days .

In 1814 the Treaty of Kiel transferred Norway to the king of Sweden , on the winning side of the Napoleonic wars , whereas the king of Denmark , on the losing side , retained the Faroes , along with the two other historical Norwegian island possessions in the North Atlantic : Greenland and Iceland .

The Bishopric 's links with Rome ceased to exist after the Scottish Reformation . The bishopric continued , saving temporary abolition between 1638 and 1661 , under the episcopal Church of Scotland until the Glorious Revolution of 1688 . Episcopacy in the established church in Scotland was permanently abolished in 1689 , but a Scottish Episcopal Church bishopric encompassing Orkney was created in 1865 , as the Bishopric of Aberdeen and Orkney . In 1878 , the Catholic Church in Scotland re-established the bishopric system , and Orkney came under the resurrected and reformatted Diocese of Aberdeen .",

In the following centuries , Norwegians , and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians , emigrated to Iceland , bringing with them thralls ( i.e. , slaves or serfs ) of Gaelic origin . The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing , one of the world 's oldest functioning legislative assemblies .
