Previously , Duvall was the Comptroller of the Treasury , a Maryland state court judge , a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland , and a Maryland state legislator . Whether Duvall is deserving of the title of the most insignificant justice in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court has been the subject of much academic interest , most notably a debate between University of Chicago Law Professors David P. Currie and ( now-Judge ) Frank H. Easterbrook in 1983 . Currie argued that impartial examination of Duvall 's performance reveals to even the uninitiated observer that he achieved an enviable standard of insignificance against which all other justices must be measured . Easterbrook responded that Currie 's analysis lacked serious consideration of candidates so shrouded in obscurity that they escaped proper attention even in a contest of insignificance , and concluded that Duvall 's colleague , Justice Thomas Todd , was even more insignificant .",

  "/wiki/South_Carolina's_5th_congressional_district": "The 5th Congressional District of South Carolina is a congressional district in northern South Carolina bordering North Carolina . The district includes all of Cherokee , Chester , Fairfield , Kershaw , Lancaster , Lee , Union and York counties and parts of Newberry , Spartanburg and Sumter counties . Outside the rapidly growing cities of Rock Hill , Fort Mill , and Lake Wylie the district is mostly rural and agricultural . The district borders were contracted from some of the easternmost counties in the 2012 redistricting . The district 's character is very similar to other mostly rural districts in the South . Democrats still hold most offices outside Republican-dominated York County . However , few of the area 's Democrats can be described as liberal by national standards ; most are fairly conservative on social issues , but less so on economics . The largest blocs of Republican voters are in the fast-growing suburbs of Charlotte , North Carolina and Cherokee County , which shares the Republican tilt of most of the rest of the Upstate . York County is by far the largest county in the district , with almost one-third of its population , and its Republican bent has pushed the district as a whole into the Republican column in recent years . In November 2010 , the Republican Mick Mulvaney defeated longtime Congressman John Spratt and became the first Republican since Robert Smalls and the end of Reconstruction to represent the district . Following Mulvaney 's confirmation as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget , a special election was held in 2017 to determine his successor .
