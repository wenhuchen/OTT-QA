He has been variously called the father of palaeontology , ichnology , and architecture , and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time ( despite perhaps only 15 of his paintings having survived ) . [ b ] Born out of wedlock to a notary , Piero da Vinci , and a peasant woman , Caterina , in Vinci , in the region of Florence , Italy , Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Italian painter Andrea del Verrocchio . Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan , and he later worked in Rome , Bologna and Venice . He spent his last three years in France , where he died in 1519 . Leonardo is renowned primarily as a painter . The Mona Lisa is the most famous of his works and the most popular portrait ever made . The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is regarded as a cultural icon as well . Salvator Mundi was sold for a world record $ 450.3 million at a Christie 's auction in New York , 15 November 2017 , the highest price ever paid for a work of art . Leonardo 's paintings and preparatory drawings - together with his notebooks , which contain sketches , scientific diagrams , and his thoughts on the nature of painting - compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary Michelangelo . Although he had no formal academic training , many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the Universal Genius or Renaissance Man , an individual of unquenchable curiosity and feverishly inventive imagination . He is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived ."
