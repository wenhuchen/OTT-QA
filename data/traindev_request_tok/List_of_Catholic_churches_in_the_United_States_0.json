Moreover , public education had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the Civil War ( 1861-65 ) .

Facilities for African Americans and Native Americans were consistently inferior and underfunded compared to the facilities for white Americans ; sometimes , there were no facilities for people of color . As a body of law , Jim Crow institutionalized economic , educational , and social disadvantages for African Americans and other people of color living in the South .
