Some Buddhist texts , such as Pancaraksa found in the homes of many Buddhist tantra tradition followers , are entirely dedicated to dharani . They are a part of their ritual prayers as well as considered to be an amulet and charm in themselves , whose recitation believed to allay bad luck , diseases or other calamity . They were an essential part of the monastic training in Buddhism 's history in East Asia . In some Buddhist regions , they served as texts upon which the Buddhist witness would swear to tell the truth .

Hari refers to God who takes away all the sorrows of his devotees . In the Rigvedas Purusha Suktam ( Praise of the supreme cosmic Being ) , Hari is the first and most important name of God ( whose Sanskrit cognate is Brahman ) , an alternative name of the supreme Being is Narayana after Hari and Purusha according to Narayana Suktam of theYajurveda . Within the Hindu tradition , it is often used interchangeably with Vishnu to such an extent that they are considered to be one and the same . In the Vedas , it is required to use the mantra Harih om before any recitation , just to declare that every ritual we perform is an offering to that supreme Divine Being ; even if the hymn praises some one or the other demigods . The idea of demigods as found in Hinduism is very different from that found within Greco-Roman mythology . This has to be borne in mind while understanding how , within Hinduism , all beings including demigods are inseparable from Hari . The phrase Harih Om gestures towards Advaita Vedanta and other categories of non-dual thinking . Harih Om is akin to saying that all creation that we can see is in fact , a mirroring of the One Self . This is not the concept of mimesis as found in Western philosophy . In Hinduism , kirtan or praise songs of any demigod has a common name known as Hari kirtan and katha and , storytelling ( oral narratives of a religious nature ) is known as Hari katha . No depiction of Hari ( God ) is permitted in Sikhism .",
