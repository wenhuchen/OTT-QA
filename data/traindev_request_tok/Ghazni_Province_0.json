They primarily live in Afghanistan and Pakistan . A substantial majority of ethnic Pashtuns share Pashto - an Eastern Iranic language in the Indo-European language family - as the native language . Globally , the Pashtuns are estimated to number around 50 million , but an accurate count remains elusive due to the lack of an official census in Afghanistan since 1979 . The majority of the Pashtuns live in the region regarded as Pashtunistan , which has been split between two countries since the Durand Line border was formed after the Second Anglo-Afghan War . The Pashtuns are a significant minority group in Pakistan , where they constitute the second-largest ethnic group or about 15 percent of the population . Smaller , but still significant Pashtun diaspora communities exist in Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan , especially in the cities of Karachi and Lahore , and in the Rohilkhand region of Uttar Pradesh , India . A recent Pashtun diaspora has also developed in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf , primarily in the United Arab Emirates . As the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan ( anywhere between 42 and 60 percent of the population ) , Pashtuns have been the dominant ethno-linguistic group for over 300 years . During the Delhi Sultanate era , the 15th-16th century Lodi dynasty briefly replaced the preexisting rulers in North India until Babur completely deposed the Lodi dynasty . Other Pashtuns fought the Safavids and Mughals before obtaining an independent state in the early 18th century , which began with a successful revolution by Mirwais Hotak followed by conquests of Ahmad Shah Durrani . The Barakzai dynasty played a vital role during the Great Game from the 19th century to the 20th century as they were caught between the imperialist designs of the British and Russian empires .",
