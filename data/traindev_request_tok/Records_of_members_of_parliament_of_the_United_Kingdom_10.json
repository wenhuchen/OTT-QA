  "/wiki/George_Robinson_(swindler)": "George Robinson was an English stockbroker and swindler in the 1720s and early 1730s . A banker in Lombard Street , he was appointed the circulating cashier of the Charitable Corporation . In 1727 he was one of the Corporation 's 'Partnership of Five ' ( with Sir Alexander Grant , William Burroughs , William Squire and John Thomson ) who began buying up shares . He and several officers of the Corporation obtained money from it by pawning false pledges , and proceeded to engage in a large scale speculation in the shares of that company and York Buildings Company , also borrowing against the shares purchased so that his partners failed to get what they bought . Robinson obtained a seat in the House of Commons when he was elected MP for Great Marlow in 1731 , but was unable to sit before the affair began to come to light . He fled to France with Thomson , the warehouse-keeper , in October . They were both declared bankrupt . Robinson was back by 25 November and appeared before the General Court of the Company . By 18 December , he was in hiding again because the Company would not supersede the Commission of bankruptcy against him . He had seen fit to absent himself from the kingdom , according to William Goostry , his attorney . Robinson was expelled from the House in absentia on 3 April 1732 for indirect and fraudulent Practices in the Affairs of the Charitable Corporation , and for having never attended the Service of the House , although required to do so .

  "/wiki/Board_of_Trade": "The Board of Trade is a British government department concerned with commerce and industry , currently within the Department for International Trade . Its full title is The Lords of the Committee of the Privy Council appointed for the consideration of all matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations , but is commonly known as the Board of Trade , and formerly known as the Lords of Trade and Plantations or Lords of Trade , and it has been a committee of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom . The Board has gone through several evolutions , beginning with extensive involvement in colonial matters in the 17th Century , to powerful regulatory functions in the Victorian Era , to virtually being dormant in the last third of 20th century . In 2017 , it was revitalized as an advisory board headed by the International Trade Secretary who has nominally held the title of President of the Board of Trade , and who at present is the only privy counsellor of the Board , the other members of the present Board filling roles as advisers . The board was first established as a temporary committee of England 's Privy Council to advise on colonial ( plantation ) questions in the early 17th century , when these settlements were initially forming . The Board would evolve gradually into a government department with considerable power and a diverse range of functions , including regulation of domestic and foreign commerce , the development , implementation and interpretation of the Acts of Trade and Navigation , and the review and acceptance of legislation passed in the colonies . Between 1696 and 1782 the Board of Trade , in partnership with the various secretaries of state over that time , held responsibility for colonial affairs , particularly in British America . The newly created office of Home Secretary then held colonial responsibility until 1801 , when the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies was established . Between 1768 and 1782 while with the Secretary of State for the Colonies , whose secretaryship was held jointly with the presidency of the Board of Trade , the latter position remained largely vacant ; this led to a diminished status of the board and it became an adjunct to the new Department and Ministry concerns . Following the loss of the American War of Independence , both the board and the short-lived secretaryship were dismissed by the king on 2 May 1782 and the board was abolished later by the Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782 ( 22 Geo . III , c 82 ) . Following the Treaty of Paris 1783 , with the continuing need to regulate trade between its remaining colonies , the independent United States and all other countries , a new Committee of Council on Trade and Plantations ( later known as 'the First Committee ' ) was established by William Pitt the Younger .",
