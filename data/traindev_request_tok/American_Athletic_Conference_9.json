  "/wiki/College_Football_Playoff": "The College Football Playoff ( CFP ) is an annual postseason knockout invitational tournament to determine a national champion for the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , the highest level of college football competition in the United States . Four teams play in two semifinal games , and the winner of each semifinal advances to the College Football Playoff National Championship game . The inaugural tournament was held at the end of the 2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season and was won by the Ohio State Buckeyes , who defeated the Oregon Ducks in the championship game . After the first season , the playoff was dominated for several years by two teams , the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Clemson Tigers ; they faced each other in the championship game three times , and in one other year they met in the semifinals . A 13-member committee selects and seeds the four teams to take part in the CFP . This system differs from the use of polls or computer rankings that had previously been used to select the participants for the Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) , the title system used in FBS from 1998 to 2013 . The current format is a Plus-One system , an idea which became popular as an alternative to the BCS after the 2003 and 2004 seasons ended in controversy . The two semifinal games rotate among six major bowl games , referred to as the New Year 's Six : the Rose Bowl , Sugar Bowl , Orange Bowl , Cotton Bowl , Fiesta Bowl , and Peach Bowl . In addition to the four teams selected for the playoff , the final CFP rankings are used to help determine the participants for the other four New Year 's Six bowls that are not hosting the semifinals that year . The semifinal games , which take place on the same day , are usually scheduled on Friday , Saturday , or Monday close to or on New Years Day , with flexibility allowed to ensure that they are not in conflict with other bowl games traditionally held on New Year 's Day . The National Championship game is then played on the first Monday that is six or more days after the semifinals . The venue of the championship game is selected based on bids submitted by cities , similar to the Super Bowl or NCAA Final Four .",
