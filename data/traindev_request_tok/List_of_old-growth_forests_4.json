The American elm is an extremely hardy tree that can withstand winter temperatures as low as \u221242 \u00b0C ( \u221244 \u00b0F ) . Trees in areas unaffected by Dutch elm disease ( DED ) can live for several hundred years . A prime example of the species was the Sauble Elm , which grew beside the banks of the Sauble River in Ontario , Canada , to a height of 43 m ( 140 ft ) , with a d.b.h of 196 cm ( 6.43 ft ) before succumbing to DED ; when it was felled in 1968 , a tree-ring count established that it had germinated in 1701 . For over 80 years , U. americana had been identified as a tetraploid , i.e . having double the usual number of chromosomes , making it unique within the genus . However , a study published in 2011 by the Agricultural Research Service of the USDA revealed that about 20% of wild American elms are diploid and may even constitute another species . Moreover , several triploid trees known only in cultivation , such as 'Jefferson ' , are possessed of a high degree of resistance to DED , which ravaged American elms in the 20th century . This suggests that the diploid parent trees , which have markedly smaller cells than the tetraploid , may too be highly resistant to the disease .",

The park set a visitation record in 2016 , surpassing five million visitors for the first time in its history . Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea . Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development , ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln 's signing the Yosemite Grant in 1864 . John Muir led a successful movement to have Congress establish a larger national park by 1890 , one which encompassed the valley and its surrounding mountains and forests , paving the way for the National Park System . Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada , and the park supports a diversity of plants and animals . The park has an elevation range from 2,127 to 13,114 feet ( 648 to 3,997 m ) and contains five major vegetation zones : chaparral and oak woodland , lower montane forest , upper montane forest , subalpine zone , and alpine . Of California 's 7,000 plant species , about 50% occur in the Sierra Nevada and more than 20% are within Yosemite .",
  "/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_forests": "The ecology of the Sierra Nevada , located in the U.S. state of California , is diverse and complex : the plants and animals are a significant part of the scenic beauty of the mountain range . The combination of climate , topography , moisture , and soils influences the distribution of ecological communities across an elevation gradient from 1,000 to 14,500 feet ( 300 to 4,400 m ) . Biotic zones range from scrub and chaparral communities at lower elevations , to subalpine forests and alpine meadows at the higher elevations . Particular ecoregions that follow elevation contours are often described as a series of belts that follow the length of the Sierra Nevada . There are many hiking trails , paved and unpaved roads , and vast public lands in the Sierra Nevada for exploring the many different biomes and ecosystems . The western and eastern Sierra Nevada have substantially different species of plants and animals , because the east lies in the rain shadow of the crest . The plants and animals in the east are thus adapted to much drier conditions . The altitudes listed for the biotic zones are for the central Sierra Nevada . The climate across the north-south axis of the range varies somewhat : the boundary elevations of the biotic zones move by as much as 1,000 feet ( 300 m ) from the north end to the south end of the range .",
  "/wiki/Giant_Sequoia": "Sequoiadendron giganteum ( giant sequoia ; also known as giant redwood , Sierra redwood , Sierran redwood , Wellingtonia or simply big tree - a nickname also used by John Muir ) is the sole living species in the genus Sequoiadendron , and one of three species of coniferous trees known as redwoods , classified in the family Cupressaceae in the subfamily Sequoioideae , together with Sequoia sempervirens ( coast redwood ) and Metasequoia glyptostroboides ( dawn redwood ) . Giant sequoia specimens are the most massive trees on Earth . The common use of the name sequoia usually refers to Sequoiadendron giganteum , which occurs naturally only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California . The oldest known giant sequoia is 3,200-3,266 years old The etymology of the genus name has been presumed - initially in The Yosemite Book by Josiah Whitney in 1868 - to be in honor of Sequoyah ( 1767-1843 ) , who was the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary . An etymological study published in 2012 concluded that Austrian Stephen L. Endlicher is actually responsible for the name . A linguist and botanist , Endlicher corresponded with experts in the Cherokee language including Sequoyah , whom he admired . He also realized that coincidentally the genus could be described in Latin as sequi ( meaning to follow ) because the number of seeds per cone in the newly-classified genus aligned in mathematical sequence with the other four genera in the suborder . Endlicher thus coined the name Sequoia as both a description of the tree 's genus and an honor to the indigenous man he admired .",

The dominant feature of the park is Lassen Peak , the largest plug dome volcano in the world and the southernmost volcano in the Cascade Range . Lassen Volcanic National Park started as two separate national monuments designated by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1907 : Cinder Cone National Monument and Lassen Peak National Monument . The source of heat for the volcanism in the Lassen area is subduction of the Gorda Plate diving below the North American Plate off the Northern California coast . The area surrounding Lassen Peak is still active with boiling mud pots , fumaroles , and hot springs . Lassen Volcanic National Park is one of the few areas in the world where all four types of volcano can be found - plug dome , shield , cinder cone , and stratovolcano .

Located entirely within Del Norte and Humboldt Counties , the four parks , together , protect 45% of all remaining coast redwood ( Sequoia sempervirens ) old-growth forests , totaling at least 38,982 acres ( 157.75 km2 ) . These trees are the tallest , among the oldest , and one of the most massive tree species on Earth . In addition to the redwood forests , the parks preserve other indigenous flora , fauna , grassland prairie , cultural resources , portions of rivers and other streams , and 37 miles ( 60 km ) of pristine coastline . In 1850 , old-growth redwood forest covered more than 2,000,000 acres ( 8,100 km2 ) of the California coast . The northern portion of that area , originally inhabited by Native Americans , attracted many lumbermen and others turned gold miners when a minor gold rush brought them to the region . Failing in efforts to strike it rich in gold , these men turned toward harvesting the giant trees for booming development in San Francisco and other places on the West Coast . After many decades of unrestricted clear-cut logging , serious efforts toward conservation began . By the 1920s the work of the Save the Redwoods League , founded in 1918 to preserve remaining old-growth redwoods , resulted in the establishment of Prairie Creek , Del Norte Coast , and Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Parks among others . Redwood National Park was created in 1968 , by which time nearly 90% of the original redwood trees had been logged . The National Park Service ( NPS ) and the California Department of Parks and Recreation ( CDPR ) administratively combined Redwood National Park with the three abutting Redwood State Parks in 1994 for the purpose of cooperative forest management and stabilization of forests and watersheds as a single unit .",
