  "/wiki/Strathaird": "Strathaird is a peninsula on the island of Skye , Scotland , situated between Loch Slapin and Loch Scavaig on the south coast . W. H. Murray said that Skye is sixty miles long , but what might be its breadth is beyond the ingenuity of man to state . Strathaird is however a straightforward triangular shape with the apex to the south where the lochs meet . Its base to the north is less clear-cut and is contained within the complex of the Cuillin range of mountains . The Munro Bl\u00e0 Bheinn that reaches 928 metres ( 3,045 ft ) is within Strathaird . It is the smallest and least populous of Skye 's main peninsulas , containing only the hamlets of Elgol , Kirkibost , Kilmarie , Drinan and Glasnakille , which are accessed via the B8083 road . The ruins of the Iron Age hill fort Dun Ringill are east of Kirkibost on the shores of Loch Slapin . The Strathaird peninsula was historically a heartland of Clan Mackinnon and tradition holds that Dun Ringill was once the seat of the clan . The Strathaird Estate was bought by musician Ian Anderson , the frontman for Jethro Tull , in 1978 . Anderson started a salmon farming business at Strathaird , which expanded throughout Scotland . The business was reportedly worth over \u00a310 million by the mid 1990s , though much of it has now been sold off . Anderson sold the estate to the John Muir Trust in 1994 , for around \u00a3750,000 .",
  "/wiki/Skye": "The Isle of Skye , commonly known as Skye ( /ska\u026a/ ; Scottish Gaelic : An t-Eilean Sgitheanach or Eilean a ' Che\u00f2 ) , is the largest and northernmost of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland . [ Note 1 ] The island 's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the Cuillin , the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country . Although it has been suggested that the Gaelic Sgitheanach describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name 's origins . The island has been occupied since the Mesolithic period , and its history includes a time of Norse rule and a long period of domination by Clan MacLeod and Clan Donald . The 18th century Jacobite risings led to the breaking up of the clan system and subsequent Clearances that replaced entire communities with sheep farms , some of which also involved forced emigrations to distant lands . Resident numbers declined from over 20,000 in the early 19th century to just under 9,000 by the closing decade of the 20th century . Skye 's population increased by 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001 . About a third of the residents were Gaelic speakers in 2001 , and although their numbers are in decline , this aspect of island culture remains important . The main industries are tourism , agriculture , fishing and forestry . Skye is part of the Highland Council local government area . The island 's largest settlement is Portree , which is also its capital , known for its picturesque harbour . There are links to various nearby islands by ferry and , since 1995 , to the mainland by a road bridge .",
  "/wiki/Clan_Mackinnon": "Clan Mackinnon or Clan Fingon ( Scottish Gaelic : Clann MhicFhionghain [ \u02c8k\u02b0l\u032a\u02e0\u00e3\u0169n\u032a\u02e0 v\u0129\u00e7\u02c8k\u02b2i\u014b\u0263\u025bn ] ) is a Highland Scottish clan associated with the islands of Mull and Skye , in the Inner Hebrides . Popular tradition gives the clan a Dalriadic Gaelic origin . The 19th-century historian W. F. Skene named the clan as one of the seven clans of Siol Alpin , who according to Skene could all trace their ancestry back to Alpin , father of Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn . Popular tradition has been until recently to consider Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn the first King of Scots and a Gael , however recent research speculates Cin\u00e1ed was a Pictish king and possibly even a Pict himself . Sir Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk speculated that Clan Mackinnon belonged to the kindred of Saint Columba , noting the Mackinnon Arms bore the hand of the saint holding the Cross , and the several Mackinnon abbots of Iona . The Mackinnon clan took part in the thirty years war with neighbouring clans such as MacKay , and McFarlane . Early history states that the Mackinnon clan was one of the most powerful clans in highland Scotland . Though little is known of the early history of the clan , it is likely to have served under the Lords of the Isles . After the forfeiture of the Lordship of the Isles in 1493 the clan would have gained some independence , and was at various times allied or at war with neighbouring clans such as the MacLeans and the MacDonalds . The clan supported the Jacobites in the 17th and 18th centuries , and tradition has the chief of the clan aiding in the escape of Bonnie Prince Charlie in his flight to France . Because of their support for the last Jacobite rebellion the Mackinnon chiefs lost the last of their ancient clan lands .",

  "/wiki/Wheelhouse_(archaeology)": "In archaeology , a wheelhouse is a prehistoric structure from the Iron Age found in Scotland . The term was first coined after the discovery of a ruined mound in 1855 . The distinctive architectural form related to the complex roundhouses constitute the main settlement type in the Western Isles in the closing centuries BC . A total of 62 sites have now been identified in the Northern and Western Isles , and on the north coast of Caithness and Sutherland . Amateur enthusiasts did some excavation in the 19th century , but professional examination of the sites did not begin until the 1930s , when digs were undertaken at Jarlshof and Gurness . No work of a modern standard was done in the Hebrides until 1946 at Clettreval on North Uist . Sometimes referred to as aisled roundhouses their characteristic features include an outer wall within which a circle of stone piers ( bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel ) form the basis for lintel arches supporting corbelled roofing with a hearth at the hub . About a third are double-walled . They range in diameter from 4 to 11.5 metres ( 13 to 38 feet ) . Those sites that have been dated tend to fall within the period 25 BC to 380 AD .

  "/wiki/Picts": "The Picts were a confederation of Celtic-speaking peoples who lived in what is today eastern and northern Scotland during the Late British Iron Age and Early Medieval periods . Where they lived and what their culture was like can be inferred from early medieval texts and Pictish stones . Their Latin name , Picti , appears in written records from Late Antiquity to the 10th century . They lived to the north of the rivers Forth and Clyde . Early medieval sources report the existence of a distinct Pictish language , which today is believed to have been an Insular Celtic language , closely related to the Brittonic spoken by the Britons who lived to the south . Picts are assumed to have been the descendants of the Caledonii and other Iron Age tribes that were mentioned by Roman historians or on the world map of Ptolemy . Pictland , also called Pictavia by some sources , achieved a large degree of political unity in the late 7th and early 8th centuries through the expanding kingdom of Fortriu , the Iron Age Verturiones . By 900 , the resulting Pictish over-kingdom had merged with the Gaelic kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata to form the Kingdom of Alba ( Scotland ) ; and by the 13th century Alba had expanded to include the formerly Brittonic kingdom of Strathclyde , Northumbrian Lothian , Galloway and the Western Isles . Pictish society was typical of many Iron Age societies in northern Europe , having wide connections and parallels with neighbouring groups . Archaeology gives some impression of the society of the Picts . While very little in the way of Pictish writing has survived , Pictish history since the late 6th century is known from a variety of sources , including Bede 's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum , saints ' lives such as that of Columba by Adomn\u00e1n , and various Irish annals .",
  "/wiki/Viking": "Vikings [ a ] were Scandinavians , who from the late 8th to late 11th centuries , raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe , and explored westwards to Iceland , Greenland , and Vinland . The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to include the inhabitants of Norse home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age , 793-1066 AD . This period of Nordic military , mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia , Estonia , the British Isles , France , Kievan Rus ' and Sicily . Facilitated by advanced sailing and navigational skills , and characterised by the longship , Viking activities at times also extended into the Mediterranean littoral , North Africa , and the Middle East . Following extended phases of ( primarily sea- or river-borne ) exploration , expansion and settlement , Viking ( Norse ) communities and governments were established in diverse areas of north-western Europe , Belarus , Ukraine and European Russia , the North Atlantic islands and as far as the north-eastern coast of North America . This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture , while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into Scandinavia itself , with profound developmental implications in both directions . Popular , modern conceptions of the Vikings - the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia - often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from archaeology and historical sources . A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century ; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival . Perceived views of the Vikings as alternatively violent , piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century . Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clich\u00e9s and stereotypes , complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy . These representations are not always accurate - for example , there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets , a costuming element that first appeared in Wagnerian opera .",

  "/wiki/Prehistory": "Human prehistory is the period between the use of the first stone tools c. 3.3 million years ago by hominins and the invention of writing systems . The earliest writing systems appeared c. 5,300 years ago , but it took thousands of years for writing to be widely adopted , and it was not used in some human cultures until the 19th century or even until the present . The end of prehistory therefore came at very different dates in different places , and the term is less often used in discussing societies where prehistory ended relatively recently . Sumer in Mesopotamia , the Indus valley civilization , and ancient Egypt were the first civilizations to develop their own scripts and to keep historical records ; this took place already during the early Bronze Age . Neighboring civilizations were the first to follow . Most other civilizations reached the end of prehistory during the Iron Age . The three-age system of division of prehistory into the Stone Age , followed by the Bronze Age and Iron Age , remains in use for much of Eurasia and North Africa , but is not generally used in those parts of the world where the working of hard metals arrived abruptly with contact with Eurasian cultures , such as the Americas , Oceania , Australasia and much of Sub-Saharan Africa . These areas also , with some exceptions in Pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas , did not develop complex writing systems before the arrival of Eurasians , and their prehistory reaches into relatively recent periods ; for example 1788 is usually taken as the end of the prehistory of Australia . The period when a culture is written about by others , but has not developed its own writing is often known as the protohistory of the culture . By definition , there are no written records from human prehistory , so dating of prehistoric materials is crucial . Clear techniques for dating were not well-developed until the 19th century .

His early works include the biography Life of Mr Richard Savage , the poems London and The Vanity of Human Wishes , and the play Irene . After nine years of work , Johnson 's A Dictionary of the English Language was published in 1755 . It had a far-reaching effect on Modern English and has been acclaimed as one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship . This work brought Johnson popularity and success . Until the completion of the Oxford English Dictionary 150 years later , Johnson 's was the pre-eminent British dictionary . His later works included essays , an influential annotated edition of The Plays of William Shakespeare , and the widely read tale The History of Rasselas , Prince of Abissinia .",

  "/wiki/Souterrain": "Souterrain ( from French sous terrain , meaning under ground ) is a name given by archaeologists to a type of underground structure associated mainly with the European Atlantic Iron Age . These structures appear to have been brought northwards from Gaul during the late Iron Age . Regional names include earth houses , fogous and Pictish houses . The term souterrain has been used as a distinct term from fogou meaning 'cave ' . In Cornwall the regional name of fogou ( Cornish for 'cave ' ) is applied to souterrain structures . The design of underground structures has been shown to differ among regions ; for example , in western Cornwall the design and function of the fogou appears to correlate with a larder use .",

  "/wiki/Ancient_Rome": "In historiography , ancient Rome is Roman civilization from the founding of the Italian city of Rome in the 8th century BC to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD , encompassing the Roman Kingdom ( 753 BC-509 BC ) , Roman Republic ( 509 BC-27 BC ) and Roman Empire ( 27 BC-476 AD ) until the fall of the western empire . The civilisation began as an Italic settlement in the Italian Peninsula , traditionally dated to 753 BC , that grew into the city of Rome and which subsequently gave its name to the empire over which it ruled and to the widespread civilisation the empire developed . The Roman Empire expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world , still ruled from the city , with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants ( roughly 20% of the world 's population at the time ) covering 5.0 million square kilometres at its height in AD 117 . In its many centuries of existence , the Roman state evolved from an elective monarchy to a democratic classical republic and then to an increasingly autocratic semi-elective military dictatorship during the Empire . Through conquest , cultural , and linguistic assimilation , at its height it controlled the North African coast , Egypt , Southern Europe , and most of Western Europe , the Balkans , Crimea and much of the Middle East , including Anatolia , Levant and parts of Mesopotamia and Arabia . It is often grouped into classical antiquity together with ancient Greece , and their similar cultures and societies are known as the Greco-Roman world . Ancient Roman civilisation has contributed to modern language , religion , society , technology , law , politics , government , warfare , art , literature , architecture and engineering . Rome professionalised and expanded its military and created a system of government called res publica , the inspiration for modern republics such as the United States and France . It achieved impressive technological and architectural feats , such as the construction of an extensive system of aqueducts and roads , as well as the construction of large monuments , palaces , and public facilities . The Punic Wars with Carthage were decisive in establishing Rome as a world power . In this series of wars , Rome gained control of the strategic islands of Corsica , Sardinia , and Sicily ; took Hispania ( modern Spain and Portugal ) ; and destroyed the city of Carthage in 146 BC , giving Rome supremacy in the Mediterranean . By the end of the Republic ( 27 BC ) , Rome had conquered the lands around the Mediterranean and beyond : its domain extended from the Atlantic to Arabia and from the mouth of the Rhine to North Africa .",

  "/wiki/Dun": "A dun is an ancient or medieval fort . In the Ireland and Britain it is mainly a kind of hillfort and also a kind of Atlantic roundhouse . The term comes from Irish d\u00fan or Scottish Gaelic d\u00f9n ( meaning fort ) , and is cognate with Old Welsh din ( whence Welsh dinas city comes ) . In some areas duns were built on any suitable crag or hillock , particularly south of the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth . There are many duns on the west coast of Ireland and they feature in Irish mythology . For example , the tale of the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Flidhais features D\u00fan Chiort\u00e1in and D\u00fan Chaoch\u00e1in . Duns seem to have arrived with the Celts in about the 7th century BC . Early duns had near vertical ramparts made of stone and timber . There were two walls , an inner wall and the outside one . Vitrified forts are the remains of duns that have been set on fire and where stones have been partly melted . Use of duns continued in some parts into the Middle Ages . Duns are similar to brochs , but are smaller and probably would not have been capable of supporting a very tall structure .",
