  "/wiki/Inca_Empire": "The Inca Empire ( Quechua : Tawantinsuyu , lit . The Four Regions ) , also known as the Incan Empire and the Inka Empire , was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America . The administrative , political and military center of the empire was located in the city of Cusco . The Inca civilization arose from the Peruvian highlands sometime in the early 13th century . Its last stronghold was conquered by the Spanish in 1572 . From 1438 to 1533 , the Incas incorporated a large portion of western South America , centered on the Andean Mountains , using conquest and peaceful assimilation , among other methods . At its largest , the empire joined Peru , southwest Ecuador , western and south central Bolivia , northwest Argentina , a large portion of what is today Chile , and southwest Colombia into a state comparable to the historical empires of Eurasia . Its official language was Quechua . Many local forms of worship persisted in the empire , most of them concerning local sacred Huacas , but the Inca leadership encouraged the sun worship of Inti - their sun god - and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of Pachamama . The Incas considered their king , the Sapa Inca , to be the son of the sun . The Inca Empire was unusual in that it lacked many features associated with civilization in the Old World .

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia , in the east by Brazil , in the southeast by Bolivia , in the south by Chile , and in the west by the Pacific Ocean . Peru is a megadiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river . At 1.28 million km2 ( 0.5 million mi2 ) , Peru is the 19th largest country in the world , and the third largest in South America . Peruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures . Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BC , the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization , to the Inca Empire , the largest state in pre-Columbian America , the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE . The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American colonies , with its capital in Lima . Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent . Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2017 .",
  "/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Inca_Empire": "The Spanish conquest of Peru was one of the most important campaigns in the Spanish colonization of the Americas . After years of preliminary exploration and military skirmishes , 168 Spanish soldiers under conquistador Francisco Pizarro , his brothers , and their native allies captured the Sapa Inca Atahualpa in the 1532 Battle of Cajamarca . It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory in 1572 and colonization of the region as the Viceroyalty of Peru . The conquest of the Inca Empire ( called Tahuantinsuyu or Tawantinsuyu in Quechua , meaning Realm of the Four Parts ) , led to spin-off campaigns into present-day Chile and Colombia , as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin . When the Spanish arrived at the borders of the Inca Empire in 1528 , it spanned a considerable area and was by far the largest of the four grand pre-Columbian civilizations [ citation needed ] . Extending southward from the Ancomayo , which is now known as the Pat\u00eda River , in southern present-day Colombia to the Maule River in what would later be known as Chile , and eastward from the Pacific Ocean to the edge of the Amazonian jungles , the empire covered some of the most mountainous terrain on Earth . In less than a century , the Inca had expanded their empire from about 400,000 km2 ( 150,000 sq mi ) in 1448 to 1,800,000 km2 ( 690,000 sq mi ) in 1528 , just before the arrival of the Spanish . This vast area of land varied greatly in cultures and in climate . Because of the diverse cultures and geography , the Inca allowed many areas of the empire to be governed under the control of local leaders , who were watched and monitored by Inca officials . Under the administrative mechanisms established by the Inca , all parts of the empire answered to , and were ultimately under the direct control of , the Emperor . Scholars estimate that the population of the Inca Empire was more than 16,000,000 . Some scholars , such as Jared Diamond , believe that while the Spanish conquest was undoubtedly the proximate cause of the collapse of the Inca Empire , it may very well have been past its peak and already in the process of decline .",

  "/wiki/Colonial_Brazil": "Colonial Brazil ( Portuguese : Brasil Colonial ) comprises the period from 1500 , with the arrival of the Portuguese , until 1815 , when Brazil was elevated to a kingdom in union with Portugal as the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves . During the early 300 years of Brazilian colonial history , the economic exploitation of the territory was based first on brazilwood ( pau brazil ) extraction ( 16th century ) , which gave the territory its name ; sugar production ( 16th-18th centuries ) ; and finally on gold and diamond mining ( 18th century ) . Slaves , especially those brought from Africa , provided most of the work force of the Brazilian export economy after a brief period of Indian slavery to cut brazilwood . In contrast to the neighboring Spanish possessions , which had several viceroyalties with jurisdiction initially over New Spain ( Mexico ) and Peru , and in the eighteenth century expanded to viceroyalties of Rio de la Plata and New Granada , the Portuguese colony of Brazil was settled mainly in the coastal area by the Portuguese and a large black slave population working sugar plantations and mines . The boom and bust economic cycles were linked to export products . Brazil 's sugar age , with the development of plantation slavery , merchants serving as middle men between production sites , Brazilian ports , and Europe was undermined by the growth of the sugar industry in the Caribbean on islands that European powers seized from Spain . Gold and diamonds were discovered and mined in southern Brazil through the end of the colonial era . Brazilian cities were largely port cities and the colonial administrative capital was moved several times in response to the rise and fall of export products ' importance . Unlike Spanish America , which fragmented into many republics upon independence , Brazil remained a single administrative unit under a monarch , giving rise to the largest country in Latin America . Just as European Spanish and Roman Catholicism were a core source of cohesion among Spain 's vast and multi-ethnic territories , Brazilian society was united by the Portuguese language and Roman Catholic faith . As the only Lusophone polity in the Americas , the Portuguese language was particularly important to Brazilian identity .",

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Portugal": "The Kingdom of Portugal ( Latin : Regnum Portugalliae , Portuguese : Reino de Portugal ) was a monarchy on the Iberian Peninsula and the predecessor of modern Portugal . It was in existence from 1139 until 1910 . After 1415 , it was also known as the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves , and between 1815 and 1822 , it was known as the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves . The name is also often applied to the Portuguese Empire , the realm 's extensive overseas colonies . The nucleus of the Portuguese state was the County of Portugal , established in the 9th century as part of the Reconquista , by V\u00edmara Peres , a vassal of the King of Asturias . The county became part of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n in 1097 , and the Counts of Portugal established themselves as rulers of an independent kingdom in the 12th century , following the battle of S\u00e3o Mamede . The kingdom was ruled by the Alfonsine Dynasty until the 1383-85 Crisis , after which the monarchy passed to the House of Aviz . During the 15th and 16th century , Portuguese exploration established a vast colonial empire . From 1580 to 1640 , the Kingdom of Portugal was in personal union with Habsburg Spain . After the Portuguese Restoration War of 1640-1668 , the kingdom passed to the House of Braganza and thereafter to the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha . From this time , the influence of Portugal declined , but it remained a major power due to its most valuable colony , Brazil . After the independence of Brazil , Portugal sought to establish itself in Africa , but was ultimately forced to yield to the British interests , leading to the collapse of the monarchy in the 5 October 1910 revolution and the establishment of the First Portuguese Republic .",

Although the United Kingdom over which he ruled ceased to exist de facto beginning in 1822 , he remained its monarch de jure between 1822 and 1825 . After the recognition of the independence of Brazil under the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro of 1825 , he continued as King of Portugal until his death in 1826 . Under the same treaty , he also became titular Emperor of Brazil for life , while his son , Pedro I of Brazil , was both de facto and de jure the monarch of the newly-independent country . Born in Lisbon in 1767 , the son of Maria I and Peter III of Portugal , he was originally an infante ( prince , but not heir to the throne ) of Portugal . He only became heir to the throne when his older brother Jos\u00e9 , Prince of Brazil , died of smallpox in 1788 at the age of 27 . Before his accession to the Portuguese throne , John VI bore the titles Duke of Braganza and Duke of Beja , as well as Prince of Brazil . From 1799 , he served as prince regent of Portugal ( and later , from 1815 , as prince regent of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves ) , due to the mental illness of his mother , Queen Maria I . In 1816 , he succeeded his mother as monarch of the Portuguese Empire , with no real change in his authority , since he already possessed absolute powers as regent . One of the last representatives of absolute monarchy in Europe , he lived during a turbulent period ; his reign never saw a lasting peace . Throughout his period of rule , major powers , such as Spain , France and Great Britain , continually intervened in Portuguese affairs .

Although France had already established an overseas colonial empire beginning in the 17th century , the French state had remained a kingdom under the Bourbons and a republic after the Revolution . Historians refer to Napoleon 's regime as the First Empire to distinguish it from the restorationist Second Empire ( 1852-1870 ) ruled by his nephew as Napoleon III . On 18 May 1804 , Napoleon was granted the title Emperor of the French ( L'Empereur des Fran\u00e7ais , pronounced [ l\u0251\u0303.p\u0281\u0153\u0281 de f\u0281\u0251\u0303.s\u025b ] ) by the French S\u00e9nat ( Senate ) and was crowned on 2 December 1804 , signifying the end of the French Consulate and of the French First Republic . The French Empire achieved military supremacy in mainland Europe through notable victories in the War of the Third Coalition against Austria , Prussia , Russia , and allied nations , notably at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 . French dominance was reaffirmed during the War of the Fourth Coalition , at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806 and the Battle of Friedland in 1807 . He was defeated during the 1815 battle of Waterloo . A series of wars , known collectively as the Napoleonic Wars , extended French influence to much of Western Europe and into Poland . At its height in 1812 , the French Empire had 130 departments , ruled over 70 million subjects , maintained an extensive military presence in Germany , Italy , Spain , and the Duchy of Warsaw , and counted Prussia and Austria as nominal allies . Early French victories exported many ideological features of the French Revolution throughout Europe : the introduction of the Napoleonic Code throughout the continent increased legal equality , established jury systems and legalised divorce , and seigneurial dues and seigneurial justice were abolished , as were aristocratic privileges in all places except Poland . France 's defeat in 1814 ( and then again in 1815 ) , marked the end of the Empire .",

The United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves was formed in 1815 , following the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil during the Napoleonic invasions of Portugal , and it continued to exist for about one year after the return of the Court to Europe , being de facto dissolved in 1822 , when Brazil proclaimed its independence . The dissolution of the United Kingdom was accepted by Portugal and formalized de jure in 1825 , when Portugal recognized the independent Empire of Brazil . During its period of existence the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves did not correspond to the whole of the Portuguese Empire : rather , the united kingdom was the transatlantic metropolis that controlled the Portuguese colonial empire , with its overseas possessions in Africa and Asia .

Argentina was defeated in 1837 , but a combined force of Chile and North Peruvian dissidents known as the United Restoration Army were victorious at the Battle of Yungay in January 1839 , which de facto ended the confederation as Peru and Bolivia were restored as independent states , and Santa Cruz fled into exile . The Peru-Bolivian Confederation was officially declared dissolved on August 25 , 1839 , by General Agust\u00edn Gamarra after his appointment as President of Peru .",

  "/wiki/Riograndense_Republic": "The Riograndense Republic , often called the Piratini Republic ( Portuguese : Rep\u00fablica Rio-Grandense or Rep\u00fablica do Piratini ) , was a de facto state that seceded from the Empire of Brazil roughly coinciding with the present state of Rio Grande do Sul . It was proclaimed on 11 September 1836 , by General Ant\u00f4nio de Sousa Neto , as a direct consequence of the victory obtained by Ga\u00facho oligarchic forces at the Battle of Seival ( 1836 ) , during the Farroupilha Revolution ( 1835-1845 ) . It had a constitution adopted in 1843 and was recognised only by Britain , France , and Uruguay . In 1839 , the Riograndense Republic formed a confederation with the short-lived Juliana Republic ( Portuguese : Rep\u00fablica Juliana ) which proclaimed its independence in the same year . November 1839 , however , saw the war result in the defeat and disappearance of the Juliana Republic . The Riograndense Republic had five capitals during its nearly nine years of existence : the cities of Piratini ( for which it is often called Piratini Republic ) , Alegrete , Ca\u00e7apava do Sul ( official capitals ) , Bag\u00e9 ( for only two weeks ) , and S\u00e3o Borja . The war between the Ga\u00fachos and the Brazilian Empire was ended by the Ponche Verde Treaty ."
