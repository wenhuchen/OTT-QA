  "/wiki/Showgirls": "Showgirls is a 1995 erotic drama film written by Joe Eszterhas and directed by Paul Verhoeven . It stars former teen actress Elizabeth Berkley , Kyle MacLachlan , and Gina Gershon . The film centers on a street-smart drifter who ventures to Las Vegas and climbs the seedy hierarchy from stripper to showgirl . Produced on a then-sizable budget of approximately $ 45 million , significant controversy and hype surrounding the film 's amounts of sex and nudity preceded its theatrical release . In the United States , the film was rated NC-17 for nudity and erotic sexuality throughout , some graphic language , and sexual violence . Showgirls was the first ( and to date only ) NC-17 rated film to be given a wide release in mainstream theaters . Distributor United Artists dispatched several hundred staffers to theaters across North America playing Showgirls to ensure that patrons would not sneak into the theater from other films , and to make sure film-goers were over the age of 17 . Audience restriction due to the NC-17 rating coupled with poor reviews resulted in the film becoming a box office bomb , grossing just $ 37 million . Despite a negative theatrical and critical consensus , Showgirls enjoyed success on the home video market , generating more than $ 100 million from video rentals , allowing the film to turn a profit and become one of MGM 's top 20 all-time bestsellers . For its video premiere , Verhoeven prepared an R-rated cut for rental outlets that would not carry NC-17 films . This edited version runs 3 minutes shorter ( 128 minutes ) and deletes some of the more graphic footage . Despite being consistently ranked as one of the worst films ever made , Showgirls has become regarded as a cult classic , was released on Blu-ray in June 2010 and has even been subject to critical re-evaluation , with some notable directors and critics declaring it a serious satire worthy of praise .",
