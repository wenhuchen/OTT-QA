  "/wiki/Frosted_Flatwoods_Salamander": "The frosted flatwoods salamander ( Ambystoma cingulatum ) is a small ( 9-13.5 cm total length ) , elongated species of mole salamander . It has a small , indistinct head , short legs , and a long , rounded tail . Typical coloration consists of a background of brownish- to purplish-black overlaid with narrow gray or silvery-white reticulations ( net-like markings ) , bands , or diffuse spotting . The gilled aquatic larvae are distinctly colored , having a series of bold brown and yellow longitudinal stripes . The frosted flatwoods salamander has a very narrow geographic distribution , occurring only in the southeastern coastal plain of the United States . It inhabits seasonally wet pine flatwoods and pine savannas east of the Apalachicola River in northern Florida , southern South Carolina , and southern Georgia . Prior to European settlement , it was most likely a common member of the fire-maintained longleaf pine ( Pinus palustris ) -wiregrass ( Aristida spp . ) community , which has since largely been replaced by urban development , agriculture , and pine silviculture . One published study documents the extirpation of a sizable breeding population as a result of a common silvicultural practice of converting natural pine forest to ditched and bedded slash pine plantation . Further degradation of remaining frosted flatwoods salamander habitat has occurred as a result of alteration of natural fire patterns . On conservation lands , a combination of winter prescribed fires and the suppression of natural summer wildfires has caused fire-maintained ephemeral wetland plant communities to shift away from their historic structure , eliminating the plants used as nesting habitat and larval refugia . As a result of these ongoing land use activities , populations are now extremely small , discontinuous , and widely fragmented throughout the range .",

They are colloquially known as amphiumas . They are also known to fishermen as conger eels or Congo snakes , which are zoologically incorrect designations or misnomers , since amphiumas are actually salamanders ( and thus amphibians ) , and not fish , nor reptiles . Amphiuma exhibits one of the largest complements of DNA in the living world , around 25 times more than a human .",

  "/wiki/Hellbender": "The hellbender ( Cryptobranchus alleganiensis ) , also known as the hellbender salamander , is a species of aquatic giant salamander endemic to the eastern and central United States . A member of the family Cryptobranchidae , the hellbender is the only extant member of the genus Cryptobranchus . Other closely related salamanders in the same family are in the genus Andrias , which contains the Japanese and Chinese giant salamanders . The hellbender , which is much larger than all other salamanders in its geographic range , employs an unusual means of respiration ( which involves cutaneous gas exchange through capillaries found in its dorsoventral skin folds ) , and fills a particular niche - both as a predator and prey - in its ecosystem , which either it or its ancestors have occupied for around 65 million years . The species is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species .",

The Japanese giant salamander ( Andrias japonicus ) reaches up to 1.44 m ( 4.7 ft ) in length , feeds at night on fish and crustaceans , and has been known to live for more than 50 years in captivity .

It gets its name from the seepages around which it lives . It is very similar in its appearance and life history to the pygmy salamander ( Desmognathus wrighti ) . These two species differ greatly from the other Desmognathus species . They are the smallest salamanders in the genus , measuring only 3-5 cm ( 1-2 in ) in length . They are also the only two terrestrial , direct-developing Desmognathus species . However , the two species are not often seen to coexist , differing in distribution by elevation ; although there are exceptions .

  "/wiki/Desmognathus_fuscus": "Desmognathus fuscus is a species of amphibian in the family Plethodontidae ( lungless salamanders ) . The species is commonly called the dusky salamander or northern dusky salamander to distinguish it from populations in the southern United States which form a separate species , the southern dusky salamander ( D. auriculatus ) . The northern dusky salamander is the most widespread representative of its genus in Canada . It can be found in eastern North America from extreme eastern Canada in New Brunswick south into the panhandle of Florida and west to Louisiana . The size of the species ' total population is unknown , but is assumed to easily exceed 100,000 . The species ' habitat differs somewhat geographically ; dusky salamanders in the northern part of the range prefer rocky woodland streams , seepages , and springs , while those in the south favor floodplains , sloughs , and muddy places along upland streams . They are most common where water is running or trickling . They hide under various objects , such as leaves or rocks , either in or near water . Alternatively , they may enter burrows for protection . The dusky salamander lays its eggs close to water under moss or rocks , in logs , or in stream-bank cavities . The larval stage which follows is normally aquatic .",
