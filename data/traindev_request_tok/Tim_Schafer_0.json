He finds that there is a sinister plot occurring at the camp that only he can stop . The game is centered on exploring the strange and imaginative minds of various characters that Raz encounters as a Psychonaut-in-training/Psycadet to help them overcome their fears or memories of their past , so as to gain their help and progress in the game . Raz gains use of several psychic abilities during the game that are used for both attacking foes and solving puzzles . Psychonauts was based on an abandoned concept that Schafer had during the development of Full Throttle , which he expanded out into a full game through his then new company Double Fine . The game was initially backed by Microsoft 's Ed Fries as a premiere title for the original Xbox console , but several internal and external issues led to difficulties for Double Fine in meeting various milestones and responding to testing feedback . Following Fries ' departure in 2004 , Microsoft dropped the publishing rights , making the game 's future unclear . Double Fine was able to secure Majesco as a publisher a few months later allowing them to complete the game after four and a half years of development . Despite being well received , Psychonauts did not sell well with only about 100,000 retail units sold at the time of release , leading to severe financial loss for Majesco and their departure from the video game market ; the title was considered a commercial failure .",
