With an area of 70,550.19 square kilometres ( 27,200 sq mi ) , Bavaria is the largest German state by land area comprising roughly a fifth of the total land area of Germany . With 13 million inhabitants , it is Germany 's second-most-populous state after North Rhine-Westphalia . Bavaria 's main cities are Munich ( its capital and largest city and also the third largest city in Germany ) , Nuremberg and Augsburg . The history of Bavaria includes its earliest settlement by Iron Age Celtic tribes , followed by the conquests of the Roman Empire in the 1st century BC , when the territory was incorporated into the provinces of Raetia and Noricum . It became a stem duchy in the 6th century AD following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire . It was later incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire , became an independent kingdom , joined the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 while retaining its title of kingdom , and finally became a state of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 . The Duchy of Bavaria dates back to the year 555 . In the 17th century AD , the Duke of Bavaria became a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire . The Kingdom of Bavaria existed from 1806 to 1918 , when Bavaria became a republic . In 1946 , the Free State of Bavaria reorganized itself on democratic lines after the Second World War .

  "/wiki/External_cardinal": "In the category of the members of the College of Cardinals in the central Middle Ages ( 11th to 13th century ) , an external cardinal ( as opposed to a curial cardinal ) was a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church who did not reside in the Roman Curia , because of simultaneously being a bishop of the episcopal see other than suburbicarian , or abbot of an abbey situated outside Rome . In the wider sense , it may also concern cardinals who were appointed to the external episcopal sees and resigned their memberships in the College of Cardinals with this appointment . As well , it can concern cardinals who were generally curial cardinals , but for some time exercised the posts of administrators or prelates of the external churches . Today , the great majority of the cardinals are archbishops of the main metropolitan dioceses of the world and reside in their countries . Apart from the exclusive right of the election of the new pope , their dignity is purely honorific . However , originally the College of Cardinals was simply a college of the clergy of the City of Rome , constituted of the bishops of the seven dioceses ( called suburbicarian sees ) bordering the diocese of Rome ( cardinal-bishops ) , priests of the parochial churches of Rome ( cardinal-priests ) and deacons heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city of Rome ( cardinal-deacons ) . Unlike today , the cardinals had real jurisdiction over the dioceses , parochial churches ( called tituli ) or deaconries to which they were attached . The phenomenon of the external cardinalate in the late Middle Ages constituted the first exception to the rule , that cardinals - members of the clergy of the diocese of Rome - can not serve simultaneously in another , external church , which is now common practice .",
