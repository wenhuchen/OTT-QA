Produced by Tom Scholz and John Boylan , the album was released on August 25 , 1976 , in the United States by Epic Records . Scholz had studied classical piano in his childhood and became involved in the Boston music scene in the late 1960s . He subsequently started to concentrate on demos recorded in his apartment basement with singer Brad Delp , and although their previous group , Mother 's Milk , had received numerous rejection letters from major record labels in the early 1970s , by 1975 , the demo tape had fallen into the hands of CBS-owned Epic Records , who signed them . Epic wanted the band to record in Los Angeles with a record producer , but Scholz was unwilling and wanted to record the album in his basement studio , so he hired Boylan to run interference with the label . In an elaborate ruse , Scholz tricked the label into thinking the band was recording on the West Coast , when in reality , the bulk was being tracked solely by Scholz at his Massachusetts home . The album 's contents are a complete recreation of the band 's demo tape , and contain songs written and composed many years prior . The album 's style , often referred to as the Boston sound , was developed through Scholz 's love of classical music , melodic hooks and guitar-heavy rock groups such as the Kinks and the Yardbirds , as well as a number of analogue electronic effects developed by Scholz in his home studio . Scholz would later found Scholz Research & Development , Inc. to market many of his inventions that he used in developing the sound on the album . The album was released by Epic in August 1976 and sold extremely well , breaking sales records , becoming the best-selling debut album in the US at the time , and winning the RIAA Century Award as best selling debut album . The album 's singles , most notably More Than a Feeling and Long Time , were both AM and FM hits , and nearly the entire album receives constant rotation on classic rock radio .
