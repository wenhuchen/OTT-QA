This is , to date , the only season of Survivor to have an odd number of castaways , with 19 , after a 20th castaway , Mellisa McNulty , withdrew the night before filming began because of panic attacks and irritable bowel syndrome . Due to the timing and lack of alternates , her spot could not be replaced . Gary Stritesky was the only contestant who applied to be on the show ; McNulty and the other 18 contestants were recruited . The cast retained the same amount of diversity as the previous season , Survivor : Cook Islands , in a conscious effort intended to show that the racial diversity of Survivor : Cook Islands was not just a ratings stunt . At the start of the season , the 19 castaways lived on a single beach and built a furnished camp , including shelters built from pre-cut wood , a kitchen area with dishware , a shower , a toilet , furniture , and the means to maintain fire , with supplies provided by the production . When the castaways were divided into two tribes , the winning tribe , Moto , won the furnished camp while the losing tribe , Ravu , had to build a new camp from scratch , and given merely a pot and a machete to survive . During the broadcast of the season , host Jeff Probst admitted that this concept did not play out quite as the producers hoped , as it led to the haves tribe predictably dominating in the challenges over the have-nots week after week . Exile Island returned once again for Fiji , with new twists . Unlike previous seasons , there were two hidden immunity idols , with one hidden at each camp . The idol now had to be played before Jeff read the results of the voting , rather than after .",

Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States .

The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II .
