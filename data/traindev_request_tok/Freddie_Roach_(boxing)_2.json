Brazil is a multiethnic society , which means that it is home to people of many different ethnic origins . As a result , majority of Brazilians do not equate their nationality with their ethnicity , usually embracing and espousing both simultaneously . In the period after the colonization of the Brazilian territory by Portugal , during much of the XVI century , the word Brazilian was given to the Portuguese merchants of Brazilwood , designating exclusively the name of such profession , since the inhabitants of the land were , in most of them , indigenous or Portuguese born in Portugal , or in the territory now called Brazil . However , long before the independence of Brazil , in 1822 , both in Brazil and in Portugal , it was already common to attribute the Brazilian gentile to a person , usually of clear Portuguese descent , resident or whose family resided in the State of Brazil ( 1530-1815 ) , belonging to the Portuguese Empire . During the lifetime of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves ( 1815-1822 ) , however , there was confusion about the nomenclature .",

  "/wiki/English_people": "The English people are a nation and an ethnic group native to England who speak the English language . The English identity is of early medieval origin , when they were known in Old English as the Angelcynn ( family of the Angles ) . Their ethnonym is derived from the Angles , one of the Germanic peoples who migrated to Great Britain around the 5th century AD . England is the largest and most populous country of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , and the majority of people living there are British citizens . The English largely descend from two main historical population groups - the earlier Celtic Britons ( or Brythons ) and the Germanic tribes who settled in Britain following the withdrawal of the Romans : the Angles , Saxons , Jutes and Frisians . Collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons , they founded what was to become the Kingdom of England ( from the Old English Englaland ) by the early 10th century , in response to the invasion and minor settlement of Danes beginning in the late 9th century . This was followed by the Norman Conquest and limited settlement of Anglo-Normans in England in the latter 11th century . In the Acts of Union 1707 , the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland merged to become the Kingdom of Great Britain . Over the years , English customs and identity have become fairly closely aligned with British customs and identity in general . The English people are the source of the English language , the Westminster system , the common law system and numerous major sports such as cricket , football , rugby union , rugby league and tennis . These and other English cultural characteristics have spread worldwide , in part as a result of the former British Empire .",

  "/wiki/Canadians": "Canadians ( French : Canadiens ) are people identified with the country of Canada . This connection may be residential , legal , historical or cultural . For most Canadians , many ( or all ) of these connections exist and are collectively the source of their being Canadian . Canada is a multilingual and multicultural society home to people of groups of many different ethnic , religious , and national origins , with the majority of the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants . Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization , different waves ( or peaks ) of immigration and settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today . Elements of Indigenous , French , British , and more recent immigrant customs , languages , and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada , and thus a Canadian identity . Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic , geographic , and economic neighbour - the United States . Canadian independence from the United Kingdom grew gradually over the course of many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867 . World War I and World War II in particular , gave rise to a desire among Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship . Legislative independence was established with the passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931 , the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 took effect on January 1 , 1947 , and full sovereignty was achieved with the patriation of the constitution in 1982 . Canada 's nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom . Legislation since the mid-20th century represents Canadians ' commitment to multilateralism and socioeconomic development .",
