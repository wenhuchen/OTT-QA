With over 7.4 million people of various nationalities [ d ] in a 1,104-square-kilometre ( 426 sq mi ) territory , Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places in the world . Hong Kong became a colony of the British Empire after Qing Empire ceded Hong Kong Island at the end of the First Opium War in 1842 . The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium War , and was further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898 . The territory was returned to China in 1997 . As a special administrative region , Hong Kong maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of mainland China under the principle of one country , two systems . Originally a sparsely populated area of farming and fishing villages , the territory has become one of the world 's most significant financial centres and commercial ports . It is the world 's tenth-largest exporter and ninth-largest importer . As one of the world 's leading international financial centres , Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade , and the currency , Hong Kong dollar , is the eighth most traded currency in the world . Hong Kong hosts the largest concentration of ultra high-net-worth individuals of any city in the world . Although the city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world , there is severe income inequality among its residents .

  "/wiki/South_Downs": "The South Downs are a range of chalk hills that extends for about 260 square miles ( 670 km2 ) across the south-eastern coastal counties of England from the Itchen Valley of Hampshire in the west to Beachy Head , in the Eastbourne Downland Estate , East Sussex , in the east . The Downs are bounded on the northern side by a steep escarpment , from whose crest there are extensive views northwards across the Weald . The South Downs National Park forms a much larger area than the chalk range of the South Downs and includes large parts of the Weald . The South Downs are characterised by rolling chalk downland with close-cropped turf and dry valleys , and are recognised as one of the most important chalk landscapes in England . The range is one of the four main areas of chalk downland in southern England . The South Downs are relatively less populated compared to South East England as a whole , although there has been large-scale urban encroachment onto the chalk downland by major seaside resorts , including most notably Brighton and Hove . The South Downs have been inhabited since ancient times and at periods the area has supported a large population , particularly during Romano-British times . There is a rich heritage of historical features and archaeological remains , including defensive sites , burial mounds and field boundaries . Within the South Downs Environmentally Sensitive Area there are thirty-seven Sites of Special Scientific Interest , including large areas of chalk grassland . The grazing of sheep on the thin , well-drained chalk soils of the Downs over many centuries and browsing by rabbits resulted in the fine , short , springy turf , known as old chalk grassland , that has come to epitomise the South Downs today . Until the middle of the 20th century , an agricultural system operated by downland farmers known as 'sheep-and-corn farming ' underpinned this : the sheep ( most famously the Southdown breed ) of villagers would be systematically confined to certain corn fields to improve their fertility with their droppings and then they would be let out onto the downland to graze . However , starting in 1940 with government measures during World War II to increase domestic food production and continuing into the 1950s , much grassland was ploughed up for arable farming , fundamentally changing the landscape and ecology , with the loss of much biodiversity .",

As of 2016 , 4.8 million live in the Republic of Ireland , and 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland . The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain , with several navigable rivers extending inland . Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature . Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages . Today , woodland makes up about 10% of the island , compared with a European average of over 33% , and most of it is non-native conifer plantations . There are twenty-six extant land mammal species native to Ireland . The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate , and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area , although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia .

During his first Pacific voyage in 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia , making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area . In 1788 , the First Fleet of convicts , led by Arthur Phillip , founded Sydney as a British penal colony , the first European settlement in Australia . Phillip named the city Sydney in recognition of Thomas Townshend , 1st Viscount Sydney . Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842 .

It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for several large mining operations .

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

Currently there is no official capital in the autonomous community , but the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz , in the province of \u00c1lava , is the de facto capital as the location of the Basque Parliament , the headquarters of the Basque Government , and the residence of the President of the Basque Autonomous Community ( the Palace of Ajuria Enea ) . The High Court of Justice of the Basque Country has its headquarters in the city of Bilbao . Whilst Vitoria-Gasteiz is the largest municipality in area , with 277 km2 ( 107 sq mi ) , Bilbao is the largest in population , with 353,187 people , located in the province of Biscay within a conurbation of 875,552 people . The term Basque Country may also refer to the larger cultural region ( Basque : Euskal Herria ) , the home of the Basque people , which includes the autonomous community .",
  "/wiki/Korea": "Korea is a region in East Asia consisting of the Korean Peninsula , Jeju Island , and several minor islands near the peninsula . Korea has been divided since 1948 between two distinct sovereign states , North Korea and South Korea . Korea is bordered by Russia to the northeast , China to the northwest , and neighbours Japan to the east via the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan ( East Sea ) . During the first half of the 1st millennium , Korea was divided between the three competing states of Goguryeo , Baekje , and Silla , together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea . In the second half of the 1st millennium , Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo , leading to the Unified Silla period . Meanwhile , Balhae formed in the north , superseding former Goguryeo . Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war , ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms . Toward the end of the 1st millennium , Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo , which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state . Around the same time , Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo . Goryeo ( also spelled as Kory\u014f ) , whose name developed into the modern exonym Korea , was a highly cultured state that created the world 's first metal movable type in 1234 . However , multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation , which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting . Following military resistance under King Gongmin that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo , severe political strife followed , and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye , who established Joseon in July 17 , 1392 ."
