  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning .",

A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) .

Indoor soccer , as it is most often known in the United States and Canada , was originally developed in these two countries as a way to play soccer during the winter months , when snow would make outdoor play difficult . In those countries , gymnasiums are adapted for indoor soccer play . In other countries the game is played in either indoor or outdoor arenas surrounded by walls , and is referred to by different names ( such as fast football ( futbol rapido ) in Mexico , showbol in South America , and indoor football ( futbol indoor ) in Spain ) . Indoor soccer has different regulations from other versions of association football designed for indoor play , such as futsal and five-a-side football . Unlike futsal , which is played on wooden or ceramic surfaces , indoor soccer is played on synthetic turf ( or , in the case of the British Masters Football variety , synthetic carpet ) . Indoor soccer courts are either delimited by walls or lines , and there are no player throw-ins . FIFA , the international body that oversees international association football competitions , does not sanction the synthetic turf version of indoor soccer , having developed its own code of indoor football ( which they refer to as futsal ) . Indoor soccer is most popular in the United States , Canada , and Mexico , with several amateur , collegiate and professional leagues functioning . While internationally less popular than futsal , indoor soccer is also played at the league level in many countries outside North America . The World Minifootball Federation ( WMF ) is the governing body of indoor soccer at the international level , having replaced the International Fast Football Federation ( FIFRA ) .
