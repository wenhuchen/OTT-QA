  "/wiki/Church_of_England": "The Church of England ( C of E ) is the established church of England . The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric , although the monarch is the supreme governor . The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion . It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",

  "/wiki/Flint": "Flint is a sedimentary cryptocrystalline form of the mineral quartz , categorized as the variety of chert that occurs in chalk or marly limestone . Flint was widely used historically to make stone tools and start fires . It occurs chiefly as nodules and masses in sedimentary rocks , such as chalks and limestones . Inside the nodule , flint is usually dark grey , black , green , white or brown in colour , and often has a glassy or waxy appearance . A thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour , typically white and rough in texture . The nodules can often be found along streams and beaches . Flint breaks and chips into sharp-edged pieces , making it useful for knife blades and other cutting tools . The use of flint to make stone tools dates back millions of years , and flint 's extreme durability has made it possible to accurately date its use over this time . Flint is one of the primary materials used to define the Stone Age . During the Stone Age , access to flint was so important for survival that people would travel or trade to obtain flint . Flint Ridge in Ohio was an important source of flint and Native Americans extracted the flint from hundreds of quarries along the ridge . This Ohio Flint was traded across the eastern United States and has been found as far west as the Rocky Mountains and south around the Gulf of Mexico .",

Modern architectural historians , such as Guy Williams ( 1990 ) and Dana Arnold ( 2004 ) , contend that Decimus Burton 's contribution to architecture has been grossly underestimated by previous architectural historians : as a consequence of the misattribution to Nash of many of his works ; of his undeserved vituperation by his neo-gothic nemesis , Augustus W. N. Pugin ; and of the consequent retention of his archives by his family . Decimus Burton 's projects include Hyde Park , London ( including the Gate/Screen at Hyde Park Corner , Wellington Arch , Cumberland Gate , Stanhope Gate , Grosvenor Gate , and the Prince of Wales 's Gate , Knightsbridge ) ; Green Park and St James 's Park ; Regent 's Park , London ( including Cornwall Terrace , York Terrace , Clarence Terrace , Chester Terrace , and the villas of the Inner Circle ( which included his own mansion , The Holme , and the original Winfield House ) ; the enclosure of the forecourt of Buckingham Palace , from which he had Nash 's Marble Arch facing the Palace moved to its present site ; the Clubhouse of the Athenaeum Club , London ; Carlton House Terrace ; Spring Gardens , St. James 's Park ; and the Palm House and the Temperate House at Kew Gardens . Outside London , Burton planned , and designed architecture of , the seaside towns of St Leonards-on-Sea and Fleetwood , and of the spa town Tunbridge Wells . His development of the Calverley Estate , of which only a small proportion survives , that contained elements of the neoclassical- , the Old English- , and the neogothic styles , was highly commended : it has been described as ' a landmark in English domestic architecture ' .

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",

The image develops from Early Christian art , as a depiction of the Heavenly throne as described in 1 Enoch , Daniel 7 , and The Apocalypse of John . In the Byzantine world , the image developed slightly differently into the half-length Christ Pantocrator , Christ , Ruler of All , a usually unaccompanied figure , and the Deesis , where a full-length enthroned Christ is entreated by Mary and St. John the Baptist , and often other figures . In the West , the evolving composition remains very consistent within each period until the Renaissance , and then remains important until the end of the Baroque , in which the image is ordinarily transported to the sky .",
  "/wiki/Stucco": "Stucco or render is a construction material made of aggregates , a binder , and water . Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid .

In English , stucco usually refers to a coating for the outside of a building and plaster to a coating for interiors ; as described below , the material itself is often little different . However , other European languages , notably including Italian , do not have the same distinction ; stucco means plaster in Italian and serves for both .

  "/wiki/English_Civil_War": "The English Civil War ( 1642-1651 ) was a series of civil wars and political machinations between Parliamentarians ( Roundheads ) and Royalists ( Cavaliers ) principally over the manner of England 's governance .

The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 . The outcome of the war was threefold : the trial and execution of Charles I ( 1649 ) ; the exile of his son , Charles II ( 1651 ) ; and the replacement of English monarchy with , at first , the Commonwealth of England ( 1649-1653 ) and then the Protectorate under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell ( 1653-1658 ) and briefly his son Richard ( 1658-1659 ) . A king had never been executed before . In England , the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship was ended , while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established Protestant Ascendancy .

After training at the Architectural Association , Cachemaille-Day set up practice with Felix Lander and Herbert Welch as Welch , Cachemaille-Day , and Lander in 1929 . Their work included the Haymills Estate in Hanger Hill . In 1935 Cachemaille-Day began an independent practice . Shortly afterwards he designed the Church of St Michael and All Angels , Northenden ( 1936-37 ) , which well illustrates his absorption of Continental experiments .

  "/wiki/Interwar_period": "In the context of the history of the 20th century , the interwar period was the period between the end of the First World War in November 1918 and the beginning of the Second World War in September 1939 . This period is also colloquially referred to as Between the Wars . Despite the relatively short period of time , this period represented an era of significant changes worldwide . Petroleum-based energy production and associated mechanisation expanded dramatically leading to the Roaring Twenties , a period of economic prosperity and growth for the middle class in North America , Europe and many other parts of the world . Automobiles , electric lighting , radio broadcasts and more became commonplace among populations in the developed world . The indulgences of this era subsequently were followed by the Great Depression , an unprecedented worldwide economic downturn which severely damaged many of the world 's largest economies . Politically , this era coincided with the rise of communism , starting in Russia with the October Revolution and Russian Civil War , at the end of World War I , and ended with the rise of fascism , particularly in Germany and in Italy . China was in the midst of a half-century of instability and civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China . The empires of Britain , France and others faced challenges as imperialism was increasingly viewed negatively in Europe , and independence movements emerged in many colonies ; the southern part of Ireland became independent after much fighting . The Ottoman , Austro-Hungarian and German empires were dismantled , while the Ottoman and German colonies were redistributed among the Allies , chiefly Britain and France . The western parts of the Russian Empire , Estonia , Finland , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland became independent nations in their own right , while Bessarabia ( modern-day Moldova ) chose to reunify with Romania .

A post-war period can become an interwar period or interbellum , when a war between the same parties resumes at a later date ( such as the period between World War I and World War II ) . By contrast , a post-war period marks the cessation of conflict entirely .",

  "/wiki/Fl\u00e8che": "In French architecture , a fl\u00e8che ( Fr . for arrow ) is a lead-covered timber spire , or spirelet . These are placed on the ridges of church or cathedral roofs and are usually relatively small . However , larger versions can be found on cathedrals such as Amiens Cathedral , Coventry Cathedral , and previously Notre-Dame de Paris , before its collapse in a 2019 fire that also destroyed the roof . The highest fl\u00e8che in the world was built at the end of the 19th century for Rouen Cathedral . Its height is 157 metres ( 515 ft ) .",
  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) . A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable ( apportioned ) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes , in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation .",
  "/wiki/Baptists": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent ."
