  "/wiki/Microsoft": "Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company with headquarters in Redmond , Washington . It develops , manufactures , licenses , supports , and sells computer software , consumer electronics , personal computers , and related services . Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems , the Microsoft Office suite , and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers . Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers . In 2016 , it was the world 's largest software maker by revenue ( currently Alphabet/Google has more revenue ) . The word Microsoft is a portmanteau of microcomputer and software . Microsoft is ranked No . 30 in the 2018 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue . Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4 , 1975 , to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800 . It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s , followed by Microsoft Windows . The company 's 1986 initial public offering ( IPO ) , and subsequent rise in its share price , created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees . Since the 1990s , it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions , their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $ 26.2 billion in December 2016 , followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $ 8.5 billion in May 2011 .",
  "/wiki/Abiword": "AbiWord ( /\u02c8\u00e6biw\u025c\u02d0rd/ ) is a free and open-source software word processor . It was originally written in C++ and since version 3 it is based on GTK+ 3 . The name AbiWord is derived from the root of the Spanish word abierto , meaning open . AbiWord was originally started by SourceGear Corporation as the first part of a proposed AbiSuite but was adopted by open source developers after SourceGear changed its business focus and ceased development . It now runs on Linux , ReactOS , Solaris , AmigaOS 4.0 ( through its Cygnix X11 engine ) , MeeGo ( on the Nokia N9 smartphone ) , Maemo ( on the Nokia N810 ) QNX and other operating systems . Development of a version for Microsoft Windows has ended due to lack of maintainers ( the latest released versions are 2.8.6 and 2.9.4 beta ) . The macOS port has remained on version 2.4 since 2005 , although the current version does run non-natively on macOS through XQuartz .

  "/wiki/FreeBSD": "FreeBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , which was based on Research Unix . The first version of FreeBSD was released in 1993 . In 2005 , FreeBSD was the most popular open-source BSD operating system , accounting for more than three-quarters of all installed BSD systems . FreeBSD has similarities with Linux , with two major differences in scope and licensing : FreeBSD maintains a complete system , i.e . the project delivers a kernel , device drivers , userland utilities , and documentation , as opposed to Linux only delivering a kernel and drivers , and relying on third-parties for system software ; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a permissive BSD license , as opposed to the copyleft GPL used by Linux . The FreeBSD project includes a security team overseeing all software shipped in the base distribution . A wide range of additional third-party applications may be installed using the pkg package management system or FreeBSD Ports , or by compiling source code . Due to its licensing , much of FreeBSD 's codebase has become an integral part of other operating systems , such as Apple 's Darwin ( the basis for macOS , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS ) , FreeNAS ( an open-source NAS/SAN operating system ) , and the system software for Sony 's PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 .",
  "/wiki/GNU_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",

  "/wiki/Portable_app": "A portable application ( portable app ) , sometimes also called standalone , is a program designed to read and write its configuration settings into an accessible folder in the computer , usually in the folder where the portable application can be found . This makes it easier to transfer the program with the user 's preferences and data between different computers . A program that does n't have any configuration options can also be a portable application . Portable applications can be stored on any data storage device , including internal mass storage , a file share , cloud storage or external storage such as USB drives and floppy disks - storing its program files and any configuration information and data on the storage medium alone . If no configuration information is required a portable program can be run from read-only storage such as CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs . Some applications are available in both installable and portable versions . Some applications which are not portable by default do support optional portability through other mechanisms , the most common being command-line arguments . Examples might include /portable to simply instruct the program to behave as a portable program , or -- cfg=/path/inifile to specify the configuration file location . Like any application , portable applications must be compatible with the computer system hardware and operating system . Depending on the operating system , portability is more or less complex to implement ; to operating systems such as AmigaOS , all applications are by definition portable .",
  "/wiki/Shareware": "Shareware is a type of proprietary software which is initially provided free of charge to users , who are allowed and encouraged to make and share copies of the program . Shareware is often offered as a download from a website or on a compact disc included with a magazine . [ citation needed ] Shareware differs from open-source software , in which the source code is available for anyone to inspect and alter ; and freeware , which is software distributed at no cost to the user but without source code being made available . There are many types of shareware , and while they may not require an initial up-front payment , many are intended to generate revenue in one way or another . Some limit use to personal non-commercial purposes only , with purchase of a license required for use in a business enterprise . The software itself may be limited in functionality or be time-limited , or it may remind the user that payment would be appreciated .",

  "/wiki/Single-sourcing": "Single-source publishing , also known as single-sourcing publishing , is a content management method which allows the same source content to be used across different forms of media and more than one time . The labor-intensive and expensive work of editing need only be carried out once , on only one document ; that source document can then be stored in one place and reused . This reduces the potential for error , as corrections are only made one time in the source document . The benefits of single-source publishing primarily relate to the editor rather than the user . The user benefits from the consistency that single-sourcing brings to terminology and information . This assumes the content manager has applied an organized conceptualization to the underlying content ( A poor conceptualization can make single-source publishing less useful ) . Single-source publishing is sometimes used synonymously with multi-channel publishing though whether or not the two terms are synonymous is a matter of discussion .",

Tables of contents and glossaries may be managed with some automation . The user interface and editing features have been described as nearly identical to Apple 's Keynote and Pages products . Apple clarified its position on rights of ebooks generated by iBooks Author on Feb 3 , 2012 to address some controversy that its ebooks could be sold only through the Apple Bookstore , specifying that only books carrying the .ibooks suffix were subject to such restrictions . Apple also specified that the use of the software to create text or PDF files are within the terms of its user agreement .",
  "/wiki/Desktop_publishing": "Desktop publishing ( DTP ) is the creation of documents using page layout software on a personal ( desktop ) computer . It was first used almost exclusively for print publications , but now it also assists in the creation of various forms of online content . Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic-quality text and images comparable to traditional typography and printing . Desktop publishing is also the main reference for digital typography . This technology allows individuals , businesses , and other organizations to self-publish a wide variety of content , from menus to magazines to books , without the expense of commercial printing . Desktop publishing often requires the use of a personal computer and WYSIWYG page layout software to create documents for either large-scale publishing or small-scale local multifunction peripheral output and distribution - although a non-WYSIWYG system such as LaTeX could also be used for the creation of highly-structured and technically-demanding documents as well . Desktop publishing methods provide more control over design , layout , and typography than word processing . However , word processing software has evolved to include most , if not all , capabilities previously available only with professional printing or desktop publishing . The same DTP skills and software used for common paper and book publishing are sometimes used to create graphics for point of sale displays , presentations , infographics , brochures , business cards , promotional items , trade show exhibits , retail package designs and outdoor signs . Although what is classified as DTP software is usually limited to print and PDF publications , DTP is n't limited to print . The content produced by desktop publishers may also be exported and used for electronic media . The job descriptions that include DTP , such as DTP artist , often require skills using software for producing e-books , web content , and web pages , which may involve web design or user interface design for any graphical user interface .",

The LibreOffice suite comprises programs for word processing , creating and editing of spreadsheets , slideshows , diagrams and drawings , working with databases , and composing mathematical formulae . It is available in 115 languages . As its native file format to save documents for all of its applications , LibreOffice uses the Open Document Format for Office Applications ( ODF ) , or OpenDocument , an international standard developed jointly by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) and the International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) . LibreOffice also supports the file formats of most other major office suites , including Microsoft Office , through a variety of import and export filters . LibreOffice is available for a variety of computing platforms , including Microsoft Windows , macOS , and Linux ( including a LibreOffice Viewer for Android ) , as well as in the form of an online office suite LibreOffice Online . It is the default office suite of most popular Linux distributions .

  "/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License": "The Mozilla Public License ( MPL ) is a free and open source software license developed and maintained by the Mozilla Foundation . It is a weak copyleft license , characterized as a middle ground between permissive free software licenses and the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) , that seeks to balance the concerns of proprietary and open source developers . As such , it allows re-licensing . MPL software can thus be converted into a copyleft license such as the GPL , or to a proprietary license ( example : KaiOS ) . It has undergone two revisions , a minor update to version 1.1 , and a major update to version 2.0 with the goals of greater simplicity and better compatibility with other licenses . The MPL is the license for Mozilla Firefox , Mozilla Thunderbird , and most other Mozilla software , but it has been used by others , such as Adobe to license their Flex product line , and The Document Foundation to license LibreOffice 4.0 ( also on LGPL 3+ ) . Version 1.1 was adapted by several projects to form derivative licenses like Sun Microsystems ' own Common Development and Distribution License .",
  "/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License": "The GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) is a free-software license published by the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) . The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own ( even proprietary ) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components . However , any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license . For proprietary software , code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library , so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components . The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries , although it is also used by some stand-alone applications . The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License . The word Lesser in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user 's complete freedom in the use of software ; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL , but not for any proprietary components .",
