With an estimated population of 2,705,994 ( 2018 ) , it is also the most populous city in the Midwestern United States . Chicago is the county seat of Cook County , the second-most-populous county in the US , with a small portion of the northwest side of the city extending into DuPage County near O'Hare Airport . Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area , often referred to as Chicagoland . At nearly 10 million people , the metropolitan area is the third most populous in the United States . Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan , Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-19th century . After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless , the city made a concerted effort to rebuild . The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades , and by 1900 , less than 30 years after the great fire , Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world . Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards , including new construction styles ( including the Chicago School of architecture ) , the development of the City Beautiful Movement , and the steel-framed skyscraper . Chicago is an international hub for finance , culture , commerce , industry , education , technology , telecommunications , and transportation . It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts , issued by the Chicago Board of Trade , which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world , generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone . Depending on the particular year , the city 's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the world 's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by the Airports Council International .",

  "/wiki/Punk_rock": "Punk rock ( or simply punk ) is a music genre that emerged in the mid-1970s . Rooted in 1960s garage rock , punk bands rejected the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock . They typically produced short , fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles , stripped-down instrumentation , and often political , anti-establishment lyrics . Punk embraces a DIY ethic ; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through independent record labels . The term punk rock was first used by American rock critics in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and certain subsequent acts they perceived as stylistic inheritors . When the movement now bearing the name developed from 1974 to 1976 , acts such as Television , Patti Smith , and the Ramones in New York City ; the Sex Pistols , the Clash , and the Damned in London ; and the Saints in Brisbane formed its vanguard . As 1977 approached , punk became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK . It spawned a punk subculture expressing youthful rebellion through distinctive styles of clothing and adornment ( such as deliberately offensive T-shirts , leather jackets , studded or spiked bands and jewelry , safety pins , and bondage and S & M clothes ) and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies . In 1977 , the influence of the music and subculture became more pervasive , spreading worldwide , especially in England . It took root in a wide range of local scenes that often rejected affiliation with the mainstream . In the late 1970s , punk experienced a second wave as new acts that were not active during its formative years adopted the style .

  "/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis": "Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs , but also the pancreas , liver , kidneys , and intestine . Long-term issues include difficulty breathing and coughing up mucus as a result of frequent lung infections . Other signs and symptoms may include sinus infections , poor growth , fatty stool , clubbing of the fingers and toes , and infertility in most males . Different people may have different degrees of symptoms . CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner . It is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) protein . Those with a single working copy are carriers and otherwise mostly healthy . CFTR is involved in the production of sweat , digestive fluids , and mucus . When the CFTR is not functional , secretions which are usually thin instead become thick . The condition is diagnosed by a sweat test and genetic testing . Screening of infants at birth takes place in some areas of the world . There is no known cure for cystic fibrosis .",
  "/wiki/Respiratory_system": "The respiratory system ( also respiratory apparatus , ventilatory system ) is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants . The anatomy and physiology that make this happen varies greatly , depending on the size of the organism , the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history . In land animals the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs . Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles , but atria in birds . These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply , thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood . These air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways , or hollow tubes , of which the largest is the trachea , which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi . These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes , the bronchioles . In birds the bronchioles are termed parabronchi . It is the bronchioles , or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds . Air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration . In most fish , and a number of other aquatic animals ( both vertebrates and invertebrates ) the respiratory system consists of gills , which are either partially or completely external organs , bathed in the watery environment . This water flows over the gills by a variety of active or passive means .",
  "/wiki/Immune_system": "The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease . To function properly , an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents , known as pathogens , from viruses to parasitic worms , and distinguish them from the organism 's own healthy tissue . In many species , there are two major subsystems of the immune system : the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system . Both subsystems use humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity to perform their functions . In humans , the blood-brain barrier , blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier , and similar fluid-brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system , which protects the brain . Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt , and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system ; however , multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens . Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections . Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants , such as plants and invertebrates . These mechanisms include phagocytosis , antimicrobial peptides called defensins , and the complement system . Jawed vertebrates , including humans , have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms , including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently . Adaptive ( or acquired ) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen , leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen . This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination .",
  "/wiki/Spiritual_healing": "Energy medicine , energy therapy , energy healing , vibrational medicine , psychic healing , spiritual medicine or spiritual healing are branches of alternative medicine based on a pseudo-scientific belief that healers can channel healing energy into a patient and effect positive results . This idea itself contains several methods : hands-on , hands-off , and distant ( or absent ) where the patient and healer are in different locations . Many schools of energy healing exist using many names : for example , biofield energy healing , spiritual healing , contact healing , distant healing , Qi Do , therapeutic touch , Reiki or Qigong . Spiritual healing occurs largely in non-denominational and ecumenical contexts , in which practitioners do not see traditional religious faith as a prerequisite for effecting cures . Faith healing , by contrast , takes place within a traditional religious context . While early reviews of the scientific literature on energy healing were equivocal and recommended further research , more recent reviews have concluded that there is no evidence supporting clinical efficiency . The theoretical basis of healing has been criticised as implausible , research and reviews supportive of energy medicine have been faulted for containing methodological flaws and selection bias , and positive therapeutic results have been determined to result from known psychological mechanisms . Edzard Ernst , formerly Professor of Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the University of Exeter , has said that healing continues to be promoted despite the absence of biological plausibility or convincing clinical evidence . that these methods work therapeutically and plenty to demonstrate that they do not . Some claims of those purveying energy medicine devices are known to be fraudulent and their marketing practices have drawn law-enforcement action in the US .",
