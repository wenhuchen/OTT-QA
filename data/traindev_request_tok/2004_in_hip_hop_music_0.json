It was released on November 12 , 2004 by Aftermath Entertainment , Shady Records , and Interscope Records . Its release date was originally set for November 16 , 2004 , but Eminem moved the release date to four days earlier after the album was leaked to the internet .

Encore debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 , selling 1.5 million copies in its first week . It also reached number one in ten other countries . Critical reception of Encore was less favorable than his previous albums , with most of the second half being heavily criticized for its lackluster quality and lack of lyrical content , though later on the album 's middle section has been singled out for a lack of quality , and Mockingbird and Like Toy Soldiers were highly praised and retrospectively have been noted as being some of Eminem 's best songs . Of note , Encore has sold 11 million copies worldwide and was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) on December 17 , 2004 . Encore provoked some controversy over anti-Bush lyrics and lyrics that parodied and targeted Jackson , who was upset about Eminem 's depiction of him in the video for Just Lose It . Retrospectively , the album is often considered to be one of Eminem 's worst albums alongside Revival ( 2017 ) . Eminem himself stated that not only did he rush some of the album because of a leak , but also that ; Encore . [ is ] not what I would consider one of my better albums in an interview with Sway Calloway in 2018 .",
