  "/wiki/Actor": "An actor is a person who portrays a character in a performance ( also actress ; see below ) . The actor performs in the flesh in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film , radio , and television . The analogous Greek term is \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 ( hupokrit\u1e17s ) , literally one who answers . The actor 's interpretation of their role - the art of acting - pertains to the role played , whether based on a real person or fictional character . Interpretation occurs even when the actor is playing themselves , as in some forms of experimental performance art . Formerly , in ancient Greece and Rome , the medieval world , and the time of William Shakespeare , only men could become actors , and women 's roles were generally played by men or boys . After the English Restoration of 1660 , women began to appear on stage in England . In modern times , particularly in pantomime and some operas , women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men .",
  "/wiki/Comedian": "A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience by making them laugh . This might be through jokes or amusing situations , or acting foolish ( as in slapstick ) or employing prop comedy . A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comedian . A popular saying , variously quoted but generally attributed to Ed Wynn , is , A comic says funny things ; a comedian says things funny , which draws a distinction between how much of the comedy can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona . Since the 1980s , a new wave of comedy , called alternative comedy , has grown in popularity with its more offbeat and experimental style . This normally involves more experiential , or observational reporting , e.g . Alexei Sayle , Daniel Tosh and Malcolm Hardee . As far as content is concerned , comedians such as Tommy Tiernan , Des Bishop , Kevin Hart and Joan Rivers draw on their background to poke fun at themselves , while others such as Jon Stewart , and Ben Elton have very strong political and cultural undertones . Many comics achieve a cult following while touring famous comedy hubs such as the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal , the Edinburgh Fringe , and Melbourne Comedy Festival in Australia . Often a comic 's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award , such as the Edinburgh Comedy Award ( formerly the Perrier comedy award ) . Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment , such as film and television , where they become more widely known ; e.g. , Eddie Izzard or Ricky Gervais . However , a comic 's stand-up success does not guarantee a film 's critical or box office success .",

  "/wiki/Fashion_designer": "Fashion design is the art of applying design , aesthetics and natural beauty to clothing and its accessories . It is influenced by cultural and social attitudes , and has varied over time and place . Fashion designers work in a number of ways in designing clothing and accessories such as bracelets and necklaces . Because of the time required to bring a garment onto the market , designers must at times anticipate changes to consumer tastes . Designers conduct research on fashion trends and interpret them for their audience . Their specific designs are used by manufacturers . This is the essence of a designer 's role ; however , there is variation within this that is determined by the buying and merchandising approach , and product quality ; for example , budget retailers will use inexpensive fabrics to interpret trends , but high-end retailers will ensure that the best available fabrics are used . Fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as aesthetically pleasing . They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn , and they work within a wide range of materials , colors , patterns and styles . Though most clothing worn for everyday wear falls within a narrow range of conventional styles , unusual garments are usually sought for special occasions such as evening wear or party dresses . Some clothes are made specifically for an individual , as in the case of haute couture or bespoke tailoring . Today , most clothing is designed for the mass market , especially casual and every-day wear are called ready to wear .",

  "/wiki/Philanthropist": "Philanthropy consists of private initiatives , for the public good , focusing on quality of life . Philanthropy contrasts with business initiatives , which are private initiatives for private good , focusing on material gain , and with government endeavors , which are public initiatives for public good , e.g. , focusing on provision of public services . A person who practices philanthropy is a philanthropist . Philanthropy is different from charity , though there is some overlap . Charity aims to relieve the pain of a particular social problem , whereas philanthropy attempts to address the root cause of the problem .",

  "/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues": "Rhythm and blues , commonly abbreviated as R & B , is a genre of popular music that originated in African American communities in the 1940s . The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans , at a time when urbane , rocking , jazz based music with a heavy , insistent beat was becoming more popular . In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s , the bands usually consisted of piano , one or two guitars , bass , drums , one or more saxophones , and sometimes background vocalists . R & B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy , as well as triumphs and failures in terms of relationships , economics , and aspirations . The term rhythm and blues has undergone a number of shifts in meaning . In the early 1950s , it was frequently applied to blues records . Starting in the mid-1950s , after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll , the term R & B became used to refer to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues , as well as gospel and soul music . In the 1960s , several British rock bands such as the Rolling Stones , the Who and the Animals were referred to and promoted as being R & B bands ; posters for the Who 's residency at the Marquee Club in 1964 contained the slogan , Maximum R & B . Their mix of rock and roll and R & B is now known as British rhythm and blues . By the 1970s , the term rhythm and blues changed again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk . In the 1980s , a newer style of R & B developed , becoming known as contemporary R & B . It combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop , soul , funk , hip hop , and electronic music .",

  "/wiki/Figure_Skating": "Figure skating is a sport in which individuals , duos , or groups perform on figure skates on ice . It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games , when it was contested at the 1908 Olympics in London . The four Olympic disciplines are men 's singles , ladies ' singles , pair skating , and ice dance . Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating , Theater on Ice , and four skating . From intermediate through senior-level competition , skaters generally perform two programs ( short and free skate ) , which may include spins , jumps , moves in the field , lifts , throw jumps , death spirals , and other elements or moves , depending on the discipline . The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges : inside and outside . Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on both at the same time , which is referred to as a flat edge . During a spin , skaters use the sweet spot of the blade , formally called a rocker , which is the roundest portion of the blade , just behind the toe pick and near the middle of the blade . Skates used in singles and pair skating have a set of large , jagged teeth called toe picks on the front of the blade . Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps . Ice dance blades have smaller toe picks . Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level ( senior ) at local , regional , sectional , national , and international competitions .",

  "/wiki/NFL": "The National Football League ( NFL ) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams , divided equally between the National Football Conference ( NFC ) and the American Football Conference ( AFC ) . The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world . The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States . The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world , with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen 's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015 . The Green Bay Packers hold the most combined NFL championships with 13 , winning nine titles before the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls afterwards .

The first game was played on January 15 , 1967 after both leagues had completed their respective 1966 seasons . After the merger , each league was re-designated as a conference , and the game has since been played between the conference champions to determine the NFL 's league champion .

  "/wiki/Singer": "Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality , rhythm , and a variety of vocal techniques . A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist ( in jazz and popular music ) . Singers perform music ( arias , recitatives , songs , etc . ) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments . Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians , such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists . Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument ( as in art song or some jazz styles ) up to a symphony orchestra or big band . Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera , Indian music and religious music styles such as gospel , traditional music styles , world music , jazz , blues , ghazal and popular music styles such as pop , rock , electronic dance music and filmi ( Indian film songs ) . Singing can be formal or informal , arranged or improvised . It may be done as a form of religious devotion , as a hobby , as a source of pleasure , comfort or ritual , as part of music education or as a profession . Excellence in singing requires time , dedication , instruction and regular practice . If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong .

  "/wiki/Reality_Television": "Reality television is a genre of television programming that documents purportedly unscripted real-life situations , often starring unknown individuals rather than professional actors . Reality television came to prominence in the late 1990s and the early 2000s with the global successes of the series Survivor , Idols , and Big Brother , all of which became global franchises . Reality television shows tend to be interspersed with confessionals , short interview segments in which cast members reflect on or provide context for the events being depicted on-screen . Competition-based reality shows typically feature gradual elimination of participants , either by a panel of judges or by the viewership of the show . Documentaries , television news , sports television , talk shows , and traditional game shows are generally not classified as reality television . Some genres of television programming that predate the reality television boom have been retroactively classified as reality television , including hidden camera shows , talent-search shows , documentary series about ordinary people , high-concept game shows , home improvement shows , and court shows featuring real-life cases . Reality television has faced significant criticism since its rise in popularity . Critics argue that reality television shows do not accurately reflect reality , in ways both implicit ( participants being placed in artificial situations ) , and deceptive ( misleading editing , participants being coached on behavior , storylines generated ahead of time , scenes being staged ) . Some shows have been accused of rigging the favorite or underdog to win . Other criticisms of reality television shows include that they are intended to humiliate or exploit participants ; that they make stars out of untalented people unworthy of fame , infamous figures , or both ; and that they glamorize vulgarity ."
