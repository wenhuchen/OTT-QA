  "/wiki/White-eared_titi": "The white-eared titi , Plecturocebus donacophilus , also known as the Bolivian titi or Bolivian gray titi , is a species of titi , a type of New World monkey , from eastern Bolivia and an area of western Brazil . The species has a range that extends east from the Manique River in Beni Department , Bolivia to southern Rond\u00f4nia in Brazil . The southern end of its range includes forests around the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra . It is a medium-sized monkey with a grey back , orange underside and distinctive white ear tufts . It has an omnivorous diet , eating fruits , other plant materials and invertebrates . It is predated upon primarily by raptors , though felids and other monkey species have been known to attack the species . It is a monogamous species and lives in small groups of two to seven members consisting of the pair and their offspring . The family group has a home range of 0.5 to 14 hectares ( 1.2 to 34.6 acres ) and the adults have a complex vocal repertoire to maintain their territory . It is also known for its characteristic twining of tails when groups are sitting together . White-eared titis can live for more than 25 years in captivity . The white-eared titi population has a declining trend . The decline is believed to be mainly caused by human-induced habitat loss and degradation .",
  "/wiki/Alcide_d'Orbigny": "Alcide Charles Victor Marie Dessalines d'Orbigny ( 6 September 1802 - 30 June 1857 ) was a French naturalist who made major contributions in many areas , including zoology ( including malacology ) , palaeontology , geology , archaeology and anthropology . D'Orbigny was born in Cou\u00ebron ( Loire-Atlantique ) , the son of a ship 's physician and amateur naturalist . The family moved to La Rochelle in 1820 , where his interest in natural history was developed while studying the marine fauna and especially the microscopic creatures that he named foraminiferans . In Paris he became a disciple of the geologist Pierre Louis Antoine Cordier ( 1777-1861 ) and Georges Cuvier . All his life , he would follow the theory of Cuvier and stay opposed to Lamarckism .",

He was head of the Vertebrate Department of the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet ( Swedish Natural History Museum ) from 1904 to 1933 . In 1891 he obtained his PhD from the University of Uppsala , spending the next twelve years as an inspector in the fisheries service . During this time-frame he made scientific trips to Florida ( 1892 - 1893 ) and the Caspian Sea ( 1899 ) . In 1904 he was appointed head of the department of vertebrates at the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet in Stockholm . In 1910 - 1911 he participated in an expedition to East Africa . From 1925 to 1942 he served as prefect of the Kristineberg Marina Forskningsstation ( Kristineberg Marine Zoological Station ) . In regard to his zoological research , his primary focus dealt with mammals , birds and fish , but he also made significant contributions in his studies of reptiles and amphibians . He was the binomial authority of numerous taxa , and has several species named after him , such as Onykia loennbergii ( Japanese hooked squid ) . The Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger named a small , secretive , venomous , endemic New Guinea elapid snake Apisthocalamus loennbergii in his honour , although this species is now synonymised with Toxicocalamus loriae ( Loria 's forest snake ) . In his obituary in the ornithological journal , Ibis , it was written : that since the days of Linnaeus hardly anyone has known so much about so many branches of zoology as L\u00f6nnberg .",
  "/wiki/Rio_Mayo_titi": "The Rio Mayo titi ( Plecturocebus oenanthe ) is a species of titi , a type of New World monkey , endemic to Peru . The Rio Mayo titi , was thought previously to have a small range of origin in the Alto Mayo valley , but research has proven that the range extends southward and reaches the Huayamba River , as well as Bajo Mayo . It had been classified as vulnerable but due to major habitat loss and restricted living space , it is now classified as Critically Endangered . In October 2012 , it was included in The World 's 25 Most Endangered Primates list . An increase in deforestation is leading to the decrease in available living space for this titi monkey , forcing it to live in sympatry with another species of Callicebus . Yet in some areas , such drastic deforestation has resulted in extremely high population density . The Rio Mayo titi is better adapted to moderately populated areas , thus overpopulation negatively impacts the species . The forests the Rio Mayo titi lives in are being destroyed for agricultural purposes , leaving little forest for the monkeys . They were only seen a few times and featured in museums until 2003 when more research was done on them . In order for this species to survive , their forests need to be protected to avoid overpopulation . Different conservation groups are working to help P. oenanthe survive . Neotropical Primate Conservation , Proyecto Mono Toc\u00f3n and Amaz\u00f3nicos para la Amazonia are working in the more southern areas to protect the monkey .",

Humboldt 's quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography . Humboldt 's advocacy of long-term systematic geophysical measurement laid the foundation for modern geomagnetic and meteorological monitoring . Between 1799 and 1804 , Humboldt travelled extensively in the Americas , exploring and describing them for the first time from a modern scientific point of view . His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years . Humboldt was one of the first people to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined ( South America and Africa in particular ) . Humboldt resurrected the use of the word cosmos from the ancient Greek and assigned it to his multivolume treatise , Kosmos , in which he sought to unify diverse branches of scientific knowledge and culture . This important work also motivated a holistic perception of the universe as one interacting entity . He was the first person to describe the phenomenon and cause of human-induced climate change , in 1800 and again in 1831 , based on observations generated during his travels .",
