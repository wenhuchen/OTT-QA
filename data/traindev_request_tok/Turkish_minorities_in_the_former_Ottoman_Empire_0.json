  "/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina": "Bosnia and Herzegovina , [ a ] abbreviated BiH or B & H , [ b ] sometimes called Bosnia-Herzegovina and often known informally as Bosnia , is a country of South and Southeast Europe , located within the Balkans . Sarajevo is the capital and largest city . Bosnia and Herzegovina is an almost landlocked country - to the south it has a narrow coast on the Adriatic Sea , about 20 kilometres ( 12 miles ) long and surrounding the town of Neum . It is bordered by Serbia to the east , Montenegro to the southeast , and Croatia surrounding north and southwest . In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous , in the northwest moderately hilly , and the northeast predominantly flatland . The inland , Bosnia , is a geographically larger region and has a moderate continental climate , with hot summers and cold and snowy winters . The southern tip , Herzegovina , has a Mediterranean climate and mostly mountainous topography . Bosnia and Herzegovina traces permanent human settlement back to the Neolithic age , during and after which it was populated by several Illyrian and Celtic civilizations . Culturally , politically , and socially , the country has a rich history , having been first settled by the Slavic peoples that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries . In the 12th century the Banate of Bosnia was established , which evolved into the Kingdom of Bosnia in the 14th century , after which it was annexed into the Ottoman Empire , under whose rule it remained from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries . The Ottomans brought Islam to the region , and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country . This was followed by annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy , which lasted up until World War I .",

Outside Turkey , significant smaller groups of speakers exist in Germany , Austria , Bulgaria , North Macedonia , Northern Cyprus , Greece , the Caucasus , and other parts of Europe and Central Asia . Cyprus has requested that the European Union add Turkish as an official language , even though Turkey is not a member state . To the west , the influence of Ottoman Turkish - the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of the Ottoman Empire - spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded . In 1928 , as one of Atat\u00fcrk 's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey , the Ottoman Turkish alphabet was replaced with a Latin alphabet . The distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination . The basic word order of Turkish is subject-object-verb . Turkish has no noun classes or grammatical gender . The language makes usage of honorifics and has a strong T-V distinction which distinguishes varying levels of politeness , social distance , age , courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee . The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect .",
  "/wiki/European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages": "The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ( ECRML ) is a European treaty ( CETS 148 ) adopted in 1992 under the auspices of the Council of Europe to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages in Europe . The preparation for the charter was undertaken by the predecessor to the current Congress of Local and Regional Authorities , the Standing Conference of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe because involvement of local and regional government was essential . The actual charter was written in the Parliamentary Assembly based on the Congress ' Recommendations . It only applies to languages traditionally used by the nationals of the State Parties ( thus excluding languages used by recent immigrants from other states , see immigrant languages ) , which significantly differ from the majority or official language ( thus excluding what the state party wishes to consider as mere local dialects of the official or majority language ) and that either have a territorial basis ( and are therefore traditionally spoken by populations of regions or areas within the State ) or are used by linguistic minorities within the State as a whole ( thereby including such languages as Yiddish , Romani and Lemko , which are used over a wide geographic area ) . Some states , such as Ukraine and Sweden , have tied the status of minority language to the recognized national minorities , which are defined by ethnic , cultural and/or religious criteria , thereby circumventing the Charter 's notion of linguistic minority . Languages that are official within regions , provinces or federal units within a State ( for example Catalan in Spain ) are not classified as official languages of the State and may therefore benefit from the Charter . On the other hand , Ireland has not been able to sign the Charter on behalf of the Irish language ( although a minority language ) as it is defined as the first official language of the state . The United Kingdom has ratified the Charter in respect to ( among other languages ) Welsh in Wales , Scots in Scotland , and Irish in Northern Ireland . France , although a signatory , has been constitutionally blocked from ratifying the Charter in respect to the languages of France . The charter provides a large number of different actions state parties can take to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages . There are two levels of protection - all signatories must apply the lower level of protection to qualifying languages . Signatories may further declare that a qualifying language or languages will benefit from the higher level of protection , which lists a range of actions from which states must agree to undertake at least 35 .",

It is bordered by Romania to the north , Serbia and North Macedonia to the west , Greece and Turkey to the south , and the Black Sea to the east . The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",

One such major development is the innovation of evidential verb forms to encode for the source of information : witnessed , inferred , or reported .

In 2011 , there were 588,318 Bulgarians of Turkish descent , roughly 8.8% of the population , making them the country 's largest ethnic minority . They primarily live in the southern province of Kardzhali and the northeastern provinces of Shumen , Silistra , Razgrad and Targovishte . There is also a diaspora outside Bulgaria in countries such as Turkey , Austria , Netherlands , Sweden , and Romania the most significant of which are the Bulgarian Turks in Turkey . Bulgarian Turks are the descendants of Turkish settlers who entered the region after the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the late 14th and early 15th centuries , as well as Bulgarian converts to Islam who became Turkified during the centuries of Ottoman rule . However , it has also been suggested that some Turks living today in Bulgaria may be direct ethnic descendants of earlier medieval Pecheneg , O\u011fuz , and Cuman Turkic tribes . According to local tradition , following a resettlement policy Karamanid Turks ( mainly from the Konya Vilayet , Nev\u015fehir Vilayet and Ni\u011fde Vilayet of the Karaman Province ) were settled mainly in the Kardzhali area by the sultans Mehmed the Conqueror , Selim and Mahmud II . The Turkish community became an ethnic minority when the Principality of Bulgaria was established after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 . This community is of Turkish ethnic consciousness and differs from the majority Bulgarian ethnicity and the rest of the Bulgarian nation by its own language , religion , culture , customs , and traditions .",

Croatia has an area of 56,594 square kilometres ( 21,851 square miles ) and a population of 4.28 million , most of whom are Roman Catholics . Croatia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Age . The Croats arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into two duchies by the 9th century . Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke Branimir . Tomislav became the first king by 925 , elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom , which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries . During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended , Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102 . In 1527 , faced with Ottoman conquest , the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of Austria to the Croatian throne . In October 1918 , in the final days of World War I , the State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs , independent from Austria-Hungary , was proclaimed in Zagreb , and in December 1918 it was merged into the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 ) .

Inhabited since paleolithic times , it has been under the political , cultural and linguistic influence of the Greek world since the classical era ; Greeks from the Aegean islands extensively colonized the region ( especially the coastal part ) and built prosperous cities such as Abdera ( home of Democritus , the 5th-century B.C . philosopher who developed an atomic particle theory , and of Protagoras , a leading sophist ) and Sale ( near present-day Alexandroupoli ) . Under the Byzantine Empire , Western Thrace benefited from its position close to the imperial heartland and became a center of medieval Greek commerce and culture ; later , under the Ottoman Empire , a number of Muslims settled there , marking the birth of the Muslim minority of Greece . Topographically , Thrace alternates between mountain-enclosed basins of varying size and deeply cut river valleys . It is divided into the three regional units ( former prefectures ) : Xanthi , Rhodope and Evros , which together with the Macedonian regional units of Drama , Kavala and Thasos form the Region of East Macedonia and Thrace .

The Serbian Kingdom obtained recognition by the Holy See and Constantinople in 1217 , reaching its territorial apex in 1346 as the relatively short-lived Serbian Empire . By the mid-16th century , the Ottomans annexed the entirety of modern-day Serbia ; their rule was at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire , which began expanding towards Central Serbia from the end of the 17th century while maintaining a foothold in Vojvodina . In the early 19th century , the Serbian Revolution established the nation-state as the region 's first constitutional monarchy , which subsequently expanded its territory . Following disastrous casualties in World War I , and the subsequent unification of the former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina ( and other lands ) with Serbia , the country co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples , which would exist in various political formations until the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s . During the breakup of Yugoslavia , Serbia formed a union with Montenegro , which was peacefully dissolved in 2006 and restoring Serbia 's independence as a sovereign state for the first time since the late 1910s .
