  "/wiki/Birdy_(film)": "Birdy is a 1984 American drama film based on William Wharton 's 1978 novel of the same name . Directed by Alan Parker , it stars Matthew Modine and Nicolas Cage . Set in 1960s Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , the film focuses on the friendship between two teenage boys , Birdy ( Modine ) and Al Columbato ( Cage ) . The story is presented in flashbacks , with a frame narrative depicting their traumatic experiences upon serving in the Vietnam War . Parker initially turned down an opportunity to direct , believing that the complex book could not be successfully adapted for a feature film . The project resurfaced in 1982 when A & M Films , a subsidiary of A & M Records , acquired the film rights and commissioned Sandy Kroopf and Jack Behr to write the screenplay . Upon reading the script , Parker returned as director , and the film continued development at Tri-Star Pictures . Principal photography began in May 1984 and concluded in August of that year . Filming took place on locations in Philadelphia and Santa Clara , California . Birdy is notable for being the first film to be partially shot with the Skycam , a computer-controlled camera system created by Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown .

The film consists primarily of slow motion and time-lapse footage of cities and many natural landscapes across the United States . The visual tone poem contains neither dialogue nor a vocalized narration : its tone is set by the juxtaposition of images and music . Reggio explained the lack of dialogue by stating it 's not for lack of love of the language that these films have no words . It 's because , from my point of view , our language is in a state of vast humiliation . It no longer describes the world in which we live . In the Hopi language , the word Koyaanisqatsi means unbalanced life . The film is the first in the Qatsi film trilogy : it is succeeded by Powaqqatsi ( 1988 ) and Naqoyqatsi ( 2002 ) . The trilogy depicts different aspects of the relationship between humans , nature and technology . Koyaanisqatsi is the best known of the trilogy and is considered a cult film . However , because of copyright issues , the film was out of print for most of the 1990s .",
