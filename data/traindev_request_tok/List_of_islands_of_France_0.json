The archipelago , part of the Melanesia subregion , includes the main island of Grande Terre , the Loyalty Islands , the Chesterfield Islands , the Belep archipelago , the Isle of Pines , and a few remote islets . The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea . French people , and especially locals , refer to Grande Terre as Le Caillou ( the pebble ) . New Caledonia has a land area of 18,576 km2 ( 7,172 sq mi ) divided into three provinces . The North and South Provinces are located on the New Caledonian mainland , while the Loyalty Islands Province is a series of islands off the mainland . Its population of 271,407 ( October 2019 census ) consists of a mix of the original inhabitants , Kanak people , who are the majority in the North Province and the Loyalty Islands Province and people of European descent ( Caldoches and Metropolitan French ) , Polynesian people ( mostly Wallisians ) , and Southeast Asian people , as well as a few people of Pied-Noir and North African descent who are the majority in the South Province .

It is located southeast of the French mainland and west of the Italian Peninsula , with the nearest land mass being the Italian island of Sardinia to the immediate south . A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island . The island is an administrative region of France ( with the regional capital being Ajaccio ) , divided in two administrative departments , Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud . The corresponding regional and departmental territorial collectivities , however , merged on 1 January 2018 , forming the single territorial collectivity of Corsica . As a single territorial collectivity , Corsica enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than other French regional collectivities ; for example , the Corsican Assembly is able to exercise limited executive powers . Bastia , the prefecture city of Haute-Corse , is the second largest town in Corsica . After being ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284 , in 1755 Corsica became a self-proclaimed Italian-speaking Republic , until it was officially ceded by Genoa to Louis XV as part of a pledge for debts and subsequently annexed to France in 1769 . Napoleon Bonaparte was born the same year in Ajaccio , and his ancestral home ( Maison Bonaparte ) is today a significant visitor attraction and museum . Due to Corsica 's historical ties with the Italian peninsula , the island retains many Italian cultural elements , and the native tongue is recognized as a regional language by the French government .",
  "/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea": "The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean , surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land : on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia , on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant . Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean , it is usually referred to as a separate body of water . Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago , the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years ( the Messinian salinity crisis ) before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago . It covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 ( 970,000 sq mi ) , representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface , but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar - the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa - is only 14 km ( 9 mi ) wide . In oceanography , it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere . The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m ( 17,280 ft ) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea . It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 N and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 36\u00b0 E. Its west-east length , from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun , on the southeastern coast of Turkey , is about 4,000 kilometres ( 2,500 mi ) . The sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times , facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region . The history of the Mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies . The countries surrounding the Mediterranean in clockwise order are Spain , France , Monaco , Italy , Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Montenegro , Albania , Greece , Turkey , Syria , Lebanon , Israel , Egypt , Libya , Tunisia , Algeria , and Morocco ; Malta and Cyprus are island countries in the sea . In addition , the Gaza Strip and the British Overseas Territories of Gibraltar and Akrotiri and Dhekelia have coastlines on the sea .",
