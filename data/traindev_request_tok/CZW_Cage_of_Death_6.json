  "/wiki/Ladder_match": "A ladder match is a type of match in professional wrestling , most commonly one where an item ( usually a title belt ) is hung above the ring , and the winner is the contestant who climbs a ladder and retrieves the item . The ladder itself becomes a key feature of the match , as wrestlers will use the ladder as a weapon to strike the opponent ( s ) , as a launching pad for acrobatic attacks , and frequently these matches include impressive falls from the top of the ladder . However , there were very few matches in which the hung item must be used in a special manner in order to win the match , such as striking the opponent with the item ( see Bam Bam Bigelow Vs. Scott Hall taser match , where one must strike the opponent with the taser , regardless of who retrieved the taser first ) . Ladder matches are often used as a finale to storylines and it is more common to have symbolic briefcases ( usually containing a contract for a future championship match ) or championship belts hung above the ring . Ladder matches and their variants ( such as TLC matches and Full Metal Mayhem ) are often used in feuds that involve a dispute over possession of an item ( such as a stolen title belt or the paperwork for the contractual services of a manager ) .
