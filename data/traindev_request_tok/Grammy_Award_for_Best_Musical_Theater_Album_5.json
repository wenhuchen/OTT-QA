  "/wiki/Flower_Drum_Song": "Flower Drum Song was the eighth musical by the team of Rodgers and Hammerstein . It is based on the 1957 novel , The Flower Drum Song , by Chinese-American author C. Y. Lee . It premiered on Broadway in 1958 and was then performed in the West End and on tour . It was adapted for a 1961 musical film . After their extraordinary early successes , beginning with Oklahoma ! in 1943 , Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had written two musicals in the 1950s that did not do well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes . Lee 's novel focuses on a father , Wang Chi-yang , a wealthy refugee from China , who clings to traditional values in San Francisco 's Chinatown . Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted the focus of the musical to his son , Wang Ta , who is torn between his Chinese roots and assimilation into American culture . The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut as a stage director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable Asian - or at least , plausibly Asian-looking - cast . The musical , much lighter-hearted than Lee 's novel , was profitable on Broadway and was followed by a national tour . After the release of the 1961 film version , the musical was rarely produced , as it presented casting issues and fears that Asian-Americans would take offense at how they are portrayed .

Its book is by Doug Wright , music by Alan Menken and lyrics by Howard Ashman ( written for the film ) , with additional lyrics by Glenn Slater . Its underwater setting and story about aquatic characters requires unusual technical designs and strategies to create gliding movements for the actors .

The production officially opened on January 10 , 2008 and closed on August 30 , 2009 after 685 performances and 50 previews .

  "/wiki/South_Pacific_(musical)": "South Pacific is a musical composed by Richard Rodgers , with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and book by Hammerstein and Joshua Logan . The work premiered in 1949 on Broadway and was an immediate hit , running for 1,925 performances . The plot is based on James A. Michener 's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1947 book Tales of the South Pacific and combines elements of several of those stories . Rodgers and Hammerstein believed they could write a musical based on Michener 's work that would be financially successful and , at the same time , send a strong progressive message on racism . The plot centers on an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island during World War II , who falls in love with a middle-aged expatriate French plantation owner but struggles to accept his mixed-race children . A secondary romance , between a U.S. lieutenant and a young Tonkinese woman , explores his fears of the social consequences should he marry his Asian sweetheart . The issue of racial prejudice is candidly explored throughout the musical , most controversially in the lieutenant 's song , You 've Got to Be Carefully Taught . Supporting characters , including a comic petty officer and the Tonkinese girl 's mother , help to tie the stories together . Because he lacked military knowledge , Hammerstein had difficulty writing that part of the script ; the director of the original production , Logan , assisted him and received credit as co-writer of the book . The original Broadway production enjoyed immense critical and box-office success , became the second-longest running Broadway musical to that point ( behind Rodgers and Hammerstein 's earlier Oklahoma ! ( 1943 ) ) , and has remained popular ever since . After they signed Ezio Pinza and Mary Martin as the leads , Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote several of the songs with the particular talents of their stars in mind .",
