  "/wiki/South_Carolina's_4th_congressional_district": "The 4th Congressional District of South Carolina is a congressional district in upstate South Carolina bordering North Carolina . It includes parts of Greenville and Spartanburg counties . The district is characterized by the two major cities of Greenville and Spartanburg . The district is the state 's wealthiest district and one of its most conservative . In the late 20th century , it has been in Republican hands since 1979 , aside from a six-year stint by Democrat Liz J. Patterson , the daughter of former Senator Olin Johnston . Even before the Republicans finally took control of the seat , the 4th had been a rather conservative district . Like in most of the state , the old-line Southern Democrats began splitting their tickets as early as the 1940s . However , this area 's white conservatives became increasingly willing to support Republicans at the state and local level as early as the 1970s , well before the rest of the state swung Republican . The district is a major destination for presidential candidates in election years , as South Carolina is one of the first states to hold a presidential primary . Republican William Timmons has represented the district since January 3 , 2019 . He succeeded Republican Trey Gowdy who did not seek reelection .",
