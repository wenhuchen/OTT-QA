  "/wiki/Blosxom": "Blosxom is a free-software weblog program ( and simple content management system ) written in Perl by Rael Dornfest . It uses the pre-existing file system instead of a database management system , unlike most blog software . The design of Blosxom is minimalist . It is distributed as a single Perl script , and all configuration is done by editing this script . All of the weblog entries are stored as plain text files consisting of a headline , optional headers or meta-information ( if using certain plugins ) , and a blank line followed by the post body . New display styles can be added by creating template files called flavours . Blosxom can operate as a CGI script or produce static HTML files . By default , Blosxom supports showing recent posts , doing content categorization , content retrieval by date ( and permalinking based on that ) , and RSS feeds . It can be extended with dozens of available plugins . Blosxom has inspired derivatives in various languages , including PyBlosxom ( in Python ) , Blojsom ( in Java ) , Clojsom ( in Clojure ) , Blosxonomy ( in Ruby ) , Blosxom.PHP ( in PHP ) , and Hobix ( in Ruby ) . Blosxom and its derivatives tend to be used by people who prefer to write weblog postings with their favourite text editor instead of using a web-based interface . However , there are plugins for web-based posting to a Blosxom weblog , too .",
  "/wiki/Perl": "Perl is a family of two high-level , general-purpose , interpreted , dynamic programming languages . Perl refers to Perl 5 , but from 2000 to 2019 it also referred to its redesigned sister language , Perl 6 , before the latter 's name was officially changed to Raku in October 2019 . Though Perl is not officially an acronym , there are various backronyms in use , including Practical Extraction and Reporting Language . Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier . Since then , it has undergone many changes and revisions . Raku , which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000 , eventually evolved into a separate language . Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another . The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C , shell script ( sh ) , AWK , and sed ; Wall also alludes to BASIC and Lisp in the introduction to Learning Perl ( Schwartz & Christiansen ) and so on . They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools , facilitating manipulation of text files . Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language , in part due to its unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities . In addition to CGI , Perl 5 is used for system administration , network programming , finance , bioinformatics , and other applications , such as for GUIs . It has been nicknamed the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages because of its flexibility and power , and also its ugliness .",
  "/wiki/Flat-file_database": "A flat-file database is a database stored in a file called a flat file . Records follow a uniform format , and there are no structures for indexing or recognizing relationships between records . The file is simple . A flat file can be a plain text file , or a binary file . Relationships can be inferred from the data in the database , but the database format itself does not make those relationships explicit . The term has generally implied a small database , but very large databases can also be flat .",
  "/wiki/MIT_License": "The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in the late 1980s . As a permissive license , it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has , therefore , reasonable license compatibility . It is compatible because it can be re-licensed under other licenses . The MIT license is compatible with many copyleft licenses , such as the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) ; MIT licensed software can be re-licensed as GPL software , and integrated with other GPL software , but not the other way around . The MIT license also permits reuse within proprietary software , provided that either all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice , or the software is re-licensed to remove this requirement . MIT-licensed software can also be re-licensed as proprietary software , which distinguishes it from copyleft software licenses . As of 2015 [ update ] , MIT was the most popular software license on GitHub , ahead of any GPL variant and other free and open-source software ( FOSS ) licenses . Notable projects that use the MIT License include the X Window System , Ruby on Rails , and Node.js .",

  "/wiki/Mod_perl": "mod_perl is an optional module for the Apache HTTP server . It embeds a Perl interpreter into the Apache server . In addition to allowing Apache modules to be written in the Perl programming language , it allows the Apache web server to be dynamically configured by Perl programs . However , its most common use is so that dynamic content produced by Perl scripts can be served in response to incoming requests , without the significant overhead of re-launching the Perl interpreter for each request . Slash , which runs the web site Slashdot , is written using mod_perl . Early versions of PHP were implemented in Perl using mod_perl . mod_perl can emulate a Common Gateway Interface ( CGI ) environment , so that existing Perl CGI scripts can benefit from the performance boost without having to be re-written . Unlike CGI ( and most other web application environments ) , mod_perl provides complete access to the Apache API , allowing programmers to write handlers for all phases in the Apache request cycle , manipulate Apache 's internal tables and state mechanisms , share data between Apache processes or threads , alter or extend the Apache configuration file parser , and add Perl code to the configuration file itself , among other things .",

  "/wiki/BSD_licenses": "BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses , imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software . This is in contrast to copyleft licenses , which have share-alike requirements . The original BSD license was used for its namesake , the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , a Unix-like operating system . The original version has since been revised , and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses . BSD is both a license and a class of license ( generally referred to as BSD-like ) . The modified BSD license ( in wide use today ) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix . The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code format , or reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format . The BSD license ( unlike some other licenses ) does not require that source code be distributed at all .",

  "/wiki/GPL": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",
  "/wiki/Foswiki": "Foswiki is an enterprise wiki , typically used to run a collaboration platform , knowledge base or document management system . Users can create wiki applications using the Topic Markup Language ( TML ) , and developers can extend its functionality with plugins .

Since then the codebases have diverged significantly . However , Foswiki continues to maintain compatibility with content written for TWiki . Foswiki stands for free and open source wiki to emphasize its commitment to open source software . The project is governed by the Foswiki Association e.V , a volunteer run , non-profit foundation . The Foswiki website is seen by some as one of the more popular Perl-related websites based upon Alexa rankings of all websites in the world .",

  "/wiki/PHP": "PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development . It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 ; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group . PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page , but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor . PHP code may be executed with a command line interface ( CLI ) , embedded into HTML code , or used in combination with various web template systems , web content management systems , and web frameworks . PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface ( CGI ) executable . The web server outputs the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code , which may be any type of data , such as generated HTML code or binary image data . PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context , such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control . The standard PHP interpreter , powered by the Zend Engine , is free software released under the PHP License . PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform , free of charge . The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014 , with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow . Since 2014 , work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification . As of February 2020 [ update ] , over half of sites on the web using PHP are still on discontinued/EOLed version 5.6 or older ; and over 55% of all websites in the world run versions prior to 7.2 , that are neither officially supported by The PHP Development Team , while security support is provided by third parties , such as Debian ( up to June 2020 for PHP 5 ) .",
