Before they officially changed their name on 20 January 2013 , they were previously known as the Singapore Armed Forces Football Club ( SAFFC ) since their establishment on 16 February 1996 . Despite their name back then , membership of the Armed Forces was not a prerequisite for players representing the team , and several international players have played for them . Using a rhino as club mascot was their second suggestion after the S.League rejected their initial proposal of having a warrior as being out of line with the policy of clubs having animal mascots . Warriors F.C . is currently the most successful club in the history of the S.League , having won the title a record nine times : in 1997 , 1998 , 2000 , 2002 , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2014 and finishing second in 4 seasons : 1996 , 1999 , 2001 , 2005 in the 22 years since the inception of the S.League . The Warriors was based in Jurong Stadium till 2000 before moving to their home ground Choa Chu Kang Stadium in 2001 .

  "/wiki/Overtime_(sports)": "Overtime or extra time is an additional period of play specified under the rules of a sport to bring a game to a decision and avoid declaring the match a tie or draw where the scores are the same . In some sports , this extra period is played only if the game is required to have a clear winner , as in single-elimination tournaments where only one team or players can advance to the next round or win the tournament . In other sports , particularly those prominently played in North America where ties are generally disfavored , some form of overtime is employed for all games . The rules of overtime or extra time vary between sports and even different competitions . Some may employ sudden death , where the first player or team who scores immediately wins the game . In others , play continues until a specified time has elapsed , and only then is the winner declared . If the contest remains tied after the extra session , depending on the rules , the match may immediately end as a draw , additional periods may be played , or a different tiebreaking procedure such as a penalty shootout may be used instead . The terms overtime and in overtime ( abbreviated OT or IOT ) are primarily used in North America , whereas the terms extra time and after extra time ( abbreviated a.e.t . ) are usually used in other continents . However , in basketball , the terms overtime and in overtime are used worldwide .",
