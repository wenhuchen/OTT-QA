The settlement was created to establish control over the region 's salt lakes , an important source of valuable salt . In 1861 the settlement was renamed Pavlodar and incorporated as a town . Pavlodar 's significance was due in large measure to the substantial agricultural and salt-producing industries that had developed there despite the town 's relatively small population . Pavlodar 's population numbered only about 8,000 in 1897 . The name Pavlodar means The Gift of Paul , and was chosen to commemorate the birth of the Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia . After 1955 , the Soviet Government 's Virgin Lands Campaign provided the impetus for the rapid growth and development of modern Pavlodar . Under the program , large numbers of young men and women from throughout the Soviet Union were relocated to the city ; industrial and commercial activity was increased ; and from the mid-1960s on , Pavlodar grew to become a major industrial centre of both the Kazakh SSR and of the Soviet Union because of a major arms and armour manufacturing facility located in the city .",
