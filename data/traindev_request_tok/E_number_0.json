  "/wiki/Curcumin": "Curcumin is a bright yellow chemical produced by Curcuma longa plants . It is the principal curcuminoid of turmeric ( Curcuma longa ) , a member of the ginger family , Zingiberaceae . It is sold as an herbal supplement , cosmetics ingredient , food flavoring , and food coloring . Chemically , curcumin is a diarylheptanoid , belonging to the group of curcuminoids , which are natural phenols responsible for turmeric 's yellow color . It is a tautomeric compound existing in enolic form in organic solvents and in keto form in water . Laboratory and clinical research have not confirmed any medical use for curcumin . It is difficult to study because it is both unstable and poorly bioavailable . It is unlikely to produce useful leads for drug development .",

The plant is a perennial , rhizomatous , herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia , that requires temperatures between 20 and 30 \u00b0C ( 68 and 86 \u00b0F ) and a considerable amount of annual rainfall to thrive . Plants are gathered each year for their rhizomes , some for propagation in the following season and some for consumption . The rhizomes are used fresh or boiled in water and dried , after which they are ground into a deep orange-yellow powder commonly used as a coloring and flavoring agent in many Asian cuisines , especially for curries , as well as for dyeing . Turmeric powder has a warm , bitter , black pepper-like flavor and earthy , mustard-like aroma . Although long used in Ayurvedic medicine , where it is also known as haridra , there is no high-quality clinical evidence for using turmeric or its constituent , curcumin , to treat any disease .",
  "/wiki/Riboflavin": "Riboflavin , also known as vitamin B2 , is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary supplement .

As a supplement it is used to prevent and treat riboflavin deficiency and prevent migraines . It may be given by mouth or injection . It is nearly always well tolerated . Normal doses are safe during pregnancy . Riboflavin is in the vitamin B group . It is required by the body for cellular respiration . Riboflavin was discovered in 1920 , isolated in 1933 , and first made in 1935 . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system .

A primarily sessile parasite native to tropical and subtropical South America through North America ( Mexico and the Southwest United States ) , this insect lives on cacti in the genus Opuntia , feeding on plant moisture and nutrients . The insects are found on the pads of prickly pear cacti , collected by brushing them off the plants , and dried . The insect produces carminic acid that deters predation by other insects . Carminic acid , typically 17-24% of dried insects ' weight , can be extracted from the body and eggs , then mixed with aluminium or calcium salts to make carmine dye , also known as cochineal . Today , carmine is primarily used as a colorant in food and in lipstick ( E120 or Natural Red 4 ) . The carmine dye was used in North America in the 15th century for coloring fabrics and became an important export good during the colonial period . After synthetic pigments and dyes such as alizarin were invented in the late 19th century , natural-dye production gradually diminished . Health fears over artificial food additives , however , have renewed the popularity of cochineal dyes , and the increased demand has made cultivation of the insect profitable again , with Peru being the largest exporter . Some towns in the Mexican state of Oaxaca are still working in handmade textiles using this cochineal . Other species in the genus Dactylopius can be used to produce cochineal extract , and are extremely difficult to distinguish from D. coccus , even for expert taxonomists ; that scientific term from the binary nomenclature , and also the vernacular cochineal insect , may be used ( whether intentionally or casually , and whether or not with misleading effect ) to refer to other biological species .
