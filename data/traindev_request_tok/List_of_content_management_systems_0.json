  "/wiki/Java_platform": "Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems , which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation , that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment . Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers . Java applets , which are less common than standalone Java applications , were commonly run in secure , sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications through being embedded in HTML pages . Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java virtual machine ( JVM ) ; byte code compilers are also available for other languages , including Ada , JavaScript , Python , and Ruby . In addition , several languages have been designed to run natively on the JVM , including Clojure , Groovy , and Scala . Java syntax borrows heavily from C and C++ , but object-oriented features are modeled after Smalltalk and Objective-C. Java eschews certain low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple memory model where objects are allocated on the heap ( while some implementations e.g . all currently supported by Oracle , may use escape analysis optimization to allocating on the stack instead ) and all variables of object types are references . Memory management is handled through integrated automatic garbage collection performed by the JVM . On November 13 , 2006 , Sun Microsystems made the bulk of its implementation of Java available under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in October 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version ( Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support ) , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java , because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to Java 11 ( Java 12 is also an non-LTS option ) .",

The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own ( even proprietary ) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components .

The LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License .

The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF .

  "/wiki/NoSQL": "A NoSQL ( originally referring to non SQL or non relational ) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases . Such databases have existed since the late 1960s , but the name NoSQL was only coined in the early 21st century , triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies . NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications . NoSQL systems are also sometimes called Not only SQL to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages , or sit alongside SQL databases in polyglot persistent architectures . Motivations for this approach include : simplicity of design , simpler horizontal scaling to clusters of machines ( which is a problem for relational databases ) , finer control over availability and limiting the object-relational impedance mismatch . The data structures used by NoSQL databases ( e.g . key-value , wide column , graph , or document ) are different from those used by default in relational databases , making some operations faster in NoSQL . The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve . Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as more flexible than relational database tables . Many NoSQL stores compromise consistency ( in the sense of the CAP theorem ) in favor of availability , partition tolerance , and speed . Barriers to the greater adoption of NoSQL stores include the use of low-level query languages ( instead of SQL , for instance the lack of ability to perform ad-hoc joins across tables ) , lack of standardized interfaces , and huge previous investments in existing relational databases . Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions , although a few databases have made them central to their designs .",

Many of XWiki Enterprise 's features are provided by extensions which are bundled with it . The wikitext is rendered using the XWiki Rendering Engine which extends WikiModel and Doxia systems , allowing it to parse Confluence , JSPWiki , Creole , MediaWiki , and TWiki syntaxes as well as XWiki 's own syntax . XWiki pages are written by default using the WYSIWYG editor and rendered with XWiki syntax to format text , create tables , create links , display images , etc ."
