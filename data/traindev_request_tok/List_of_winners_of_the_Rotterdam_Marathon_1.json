During this Cold War period , the western portion of Germany was part of the Western Bloc . The Federal Republic was created during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II , established from eleven states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . Its ( provisional ) capital was the city of Bonn . The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the Bonn Republic . At the onset of the Cold War , Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs . Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories , the Saarland and a divided Berlin . Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair . From the West German perspective , the GDR was therefore illegitimate . Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 1952 , and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 .",

It is the westernmost sovereign state of mainland Europe , being bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain . Its territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira , both autonomous regions with their own regional governments . Portugal is the oldest nation state on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in Europe and the world , its territory having been continuously settled , invaded and fought over since prehistoric times . The pre-Celtic people , Iberians , Celts , Carthaginians and Romans were followed by the invasions of the Visigoths and Suebi Germanic peoples . After the Muslim conquests of the Iberian Peninsula , most of the territory was part of Al-Andalus until their expulsion . Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian Reconquista . Founded in 868 , the County of Portugal gained prominence after the Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede in 1128 . The Kingdom of Portugal was later proclaimed following the Battle of Ourique in 1139 , and independence from Le\u00f3n was recognised by the Treaty of Zamora in 1143 .

During the greater part of this period she was most successful at the longer distance . The variety of the twenty-three national titles she obtained during her long carrier clearly shows to what extent Beurskens dominated all aspects of the m\u00e9tier : three titles on indoor- and five on outdoor tracks , nine on the road and six in the cross country . At the long distances she is by far the most successful Dutch female athlete ever . Carla Beurskens did not very often represent her native country in major international tournaments . She took part in the Summer Olympics twice : in Los Angeles 1984 and Seoul 1988 , three times in European and one time in World Championships . For various reasons she never performed particularly well at those events . Her fifth place in the European Championships marathon of 1982 in Athens was her best achievement ever . Much better were Beurskens achievements in the marathons of various big cities all over the world . For instance , with the exception of Kenyas Tegla Loroupe , she is the only female athlete who won the Rotterdam Marathon more than once . And this although shortly after her first victory in 1984 she declared that in the future she would ignore Rotterdam , unless the circumstances for female competitors would improve drastically .
