  "/wiki/Geetha_Angara_homicide": "On the afternoon of February 9 , 2005 , the body of Geetha Angara , a chemist , was found in a water tank at the Passaic Valley Water Commission treatment facility in Totowa , New Jersey , United States , after the tanks had been drained . She had not been seen since the previous morning when she had gone to the water tanks to take samples ; items she had been carrying when she was last seen alive were also found . The items , a radio and broken beaker , were found in the water , below an access panel that was slightly ajar . Broken glass was found on the floor near that panel . An autopsy found bruises on Angara 's neck consistent with choking , as well as on her waist and elbows , suggesting she had been involved in a violent struggle , but not a deadly one . The cause of death was determined to be drowning , as she was alive when she had gone into the water . Investigators classified the case as a homicide , believing the killing had been intentional ; they put Angara 's death as having occurred the day before . Since access to the plant was tightly controlled , police believed that the responsible party was someone else in the plant that day . After interviewing all of Angara 's coworkers over the next few months , detectives found some possible motives and narrowed a list of possible suspects down to eight men . Three were ultimately considered suspects , but after further investigation the case went cold , and as of 2020 [ update ] they have not been publicly identified and no arrests have been made . Investigators have also considered the possibility that the death was purely accidental , based on the work of a Scottish pathologist who argues that injuries very similar to those associated with strangulation can occur as victims drown in very cold water such as that Angara was found in - the theory is that the plate over the tank might negligently have been left open following some sample collection for water testing . Struck by similarities with a 1968 killing of a woman , also in Passaic County , alone while in a high-security industrial complex on a weekend , they looked for leads in that case 's file .",

  "/wiki/Abel_Prize": "The Abel Prize /\u02c8\u0251\u02d0b\u0259l/ ( Norwegian : Abelprisen ) is a Norwegian prize awarded annually by the King of Norway to one or more outstanding mathematicians . It is named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel ( 1802-1829 ) and directly modeled after the Nobel Prizes . It comes with a monetary award of 7.5 million Norwegian Kroner ( NOK ) . The Abel Prize 's history dates back to 1899 , when its establishment was proposed by the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie when he learned that Alfred Nobel 's plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics . In 1902 , King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway indicated his willingness to finance a mathematics prize to complement the Nobel Prizes , but the establishment of the prize was prevented by the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 . It took almost a century before the prize was finally established by the Government of Norway in 2001 , and it was specifically intended to give the mathematicians their own equivalent of a Nobel Prize . The laureates are selected by the Abel Committee , the members of which are appointed by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters . The award ceremony takes place in the Aula of the University of Oslo , where the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded between 1947 and 1989 .

  "/wiki/Public-key_cryptography": "Public-key cryptography , or asymmetric cryptography , is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys : public keys which may be disseminated widely , and private keys which are known only to the owner . The generation of such keys depends on cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems to produce one-way functions . Effective security only requires keeping the private key private ; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security . In such a system , any person can encrypt a message using the receiver 's public key , but that encrypted message can only be decrypted with the receiver 's private key . Robust authentication is also possible . A sender can combine a message with a private key to create a short digital signature on the message . Anyone with the sender 's corresponding public key can combine the same message and the supposed digital signature associated with it to verify whether the signature was valid , i.e . made by the owner of the corresponding private key . Public key algorithms are fundamental security ingredients in modern cryptosystems , applications and protocols assuring the confidentiality , authenticity and non-repudiability of electronic communications and data storage . They underpin various Internet standards , such as Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) , S/MIME , PGP , and GPG . Some public key algorithms provide key distribution and secrecy ( e.g. , Diffie-Hellman key exchange ) , some provide digital signatures ( e.g. , Digital Signature Algorithm ) , and some provide both ( e.g. , RSA ) .",
