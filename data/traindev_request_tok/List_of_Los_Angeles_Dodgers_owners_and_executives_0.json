Byrne was a graduate of St. Francis Xavier College , and after graduation he worked as a writer for a newspaper . Byrne , his brother-in-law Joseph Doyle , New York Herald editor George J. Taylor , and Rhode Island casino owner Ferdinand Abell formed a group that raised the money to found the Brooklyn ball club in 1883 , known originally as simply the Brooklyns . They leased land on Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn to build Washington Park , the team 's original home , which cost $ 30,000 . In its first year , the team played in the minor-league Inter-State Association of Professional Baseball Clubs , winning the league championship . Having attracted a following , the owners moved the franchise in 1884 to the American Association ( AA ) , a competitor to the more established National League ( NL ) , that catered to a more working-class crowd . After managing the team from 1885-1887 , Byrne saw the franchise join the National League in 1890 , and remained in the ownership group until his death in 1898 . Under his tenure , the team , known variously as the Brooklyns , Bridegrooms and Grooms , posted a record of 567-506 and won two league championships ( the AA in 1889 and the NL in 1890 ) . Byrne was in ill health at the time of the National League meeting in November 1897 , but he insisted on making the journey from Virginia , where he had been recovering , to the event in Philadelphia .

Smolinisky began his career in commercial real estate in the late 1990s while attending the University of Southern California . Smolinisky partnered with his then landlord Brian Chen after observing a large shortage of student housing around USC . Together , through their company Conquest Student Housing , they built and renovated many properties around Campus , eventually becoming the largest provider of private student housing at USC , and later at the University of California at Santa Barbara . Conquest became so dominant at USC that the University sued the company under the Sherman Antitrust Act for monopolizing the student housing market around USCs University Park Campus . The company was sold to a private equity firm and publicly traded REIT in summer 2008 for $ 205 million . After the sale , Smolinisky and Chen focused on public securities investments . Smolinisky and Chen are value investors , an investment paradigm that derives from the ideas on investment that Benjamin Graham and David Dodd began teaching at Columbia Business School in 1928 , focusing on acquiring assets at less than their intrinsic value . Today , that movement is most closely associated with Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren E. Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie T. Munger . Smolinisky and Chen manage their own personal capital ( approximately $ 1 billion in assets ) from Pacific Palisades , California . Investments include shopping centers in Los Angeles , 5,000 apartments across the U.S. , publicly traded securities holdings , and a capital equipment leasing business ."
