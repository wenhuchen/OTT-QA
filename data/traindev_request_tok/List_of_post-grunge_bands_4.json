One of the key cities in the British colonization of the Americas , Charles Town played a major role in the slave trade , which laid the foundation for the city 's size and wealth , and was dominated by a slavocracy of plantation owners and slave traders . Independent Charleston slave traders like Joseph Wragg were the first to break through the monopoly of the Royal African Company , pioneering the large-scale slave trade of the 18th century . Historians estimate that nearly half of all Africans brought to America arrived in Charleston , most at Gadsden 's Wharf .

Greater Memphis is the 42nd largest metropolitan area in the United States , with a population of 1,348,260 in 2017 . The city is the anchor of West Tennessee and the greater Mid-South region , which includes portions of neighboring Arkansas and Mississippi . Memphis is the seat of Shelby County , the most populous county in Tennessee . As one of the more historic and culturally significant cities of the southern United States , the city features a wide variety of landscapes and distinct neighborhoods . The first European explorer to visit the area of present-day Memphis was Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1541 with his expedition into the New World . The high Chickasaw Bluffs protecting the location from the waters of the Mississippi would then be contested between the Spanish , French , and the English as Memphis took shape . Modern Memphis was founded in 1819 by three prominent Americans : John Overton , James Winchester , and future president Andrew Jackson . Memphis grew into one of the largest cities of the Antebellum South as a market for agricultural goods , natural resources like lumber , and the American slave trade . After the American Civil War and the end of slavery , the city experienced even faster growth into the 20th century as it became among the largest world markets for cotton and lumber . Home to Tennessee 's largest African-American population , Memphis played a prominent role in the American civil rights movement and was the site of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. 's 1968 assassination ."
