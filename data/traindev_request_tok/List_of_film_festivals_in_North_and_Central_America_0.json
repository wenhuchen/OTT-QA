This idea really does force people to rethink the idea of film storytelling , something Hollywood virtually never does any more . . Limits liberate the best of these filmmakers , rather than confining them , wrote Charlotte Observer theater critic and culture reporter Lawrence Toppman in November 2015 . Filmmaker Scott Galloway , founder of Charlotte-based media production company Susie Films , is the festival 's founder and director .",
