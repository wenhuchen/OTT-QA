The bus allows data exchange between plug-in modules ( up to 24 in a single crate ) and a crate controller , which then interfaces to a PC or to a VME-CAMAC interface . The standard was originally defined by the ESONE Committee as standard EUR 4100 in 1972 , and covers the mechanical , electrical , and logical elements of a parallel bus ( dataway ) for the plug-in modules . Several standards have been defined for multiple crate systems , including the Parallel Branch Highway definition and Serial Highway definition . Vendor-specific Host/Crate interfaces have also been built . The CAMAC standard encompasses IEEE standards :",
  "/wiki/S-100_bus": "The S-100 bus or Altair bus , IEEE696-1983 ( withdrawn ) , is an early computer bus designed in 1974 as a part of the Altair 8800 . The S-100 bus was the first industry standard expansion bus for the microcomputer industry . S-100 computers , consisting of processor and peripheral cards , were produced by a number of manufacturers . The S-100 bus formed the basis for homebrew computers whose builders ( e.g. , the Homebrew Computer Club ) implemented drivers for CP/M and MP/M . These S-100 microcomputers ran the gamut from hobbyist toy to small business workstation and were common in early home computers until the advent of the IBM PC ( which some of them outperformed ) .",
  "/wiki/Intel_8080": "The Intel 8080 ( eighty-eighty ) was the second 8-bit microprocessor designed and manufactured by Intel and was released in April 1974 . It is an extended and enhanced variant of the earlier 8008 design , although without binary compatibility . The initial specified clock rate or frequency limit was 2 MHz , and with common instructions using 4 , 5 , 7 , 10 , or 11 cycles this meant that it operated at a typical speed of a few hundred thousand instructions per second . A faster variant 8080A-1 ( Sometimes called the 8080B ) became available later with clock frequency limit up to 3.125 MHz . The 8080 needs two support chips to function in most applications , the i8224 clock generator/driver and the i8228 bus controller , and it is implemented in N-type metal-oxide-semiconductor logic ( NMOS ) using non-saturated enhancement mode transistors as loads thus demanding a +12 V and a \u22125 V voltage in addition to the main transistor-transistor logic ( TTL ) compatible +5 V. Although earlier microprocessors were used for calculators , cash registers , computer terminals , industrial robots , and other applications , the 8080 became one of the first widespread microprocessors . Several factors contributed to its popularity : its 40-pin package made it easier to interface than the 18-pin 8008 , and also made its data bus more efficient ; its NMOS implementation gave it faster transistors than those of the P-type metal-oxide-semiconductor logic ( PMOS ) 8008 , while also simplifying interfacing by making it TTL-compatible ; a wider variety of support chips was available ; its instruction set was enhanced over the 8008 ; and its full 16-bit address bus ( versus the 14-bit one of the 8008 ) enabled it to access 64 KB of memory , four times more than the 8008 's range of 16 KB . It became the engine of the Altair 8800 , and subsequent S-100 bus personal computers , until it was replaced by the Z80 in this role , and was the original target CPU for CP/M operating systems developed by Gary Kildall . The 8080 was successful enough that compatibility at the assembly language level became a design requirement for the Intel 8086 when its design began in 1976 , and led to the 8080 directly influencing all later variants of the ubiquitous 32-bit and 64-bit x86 architectures .",

  "/wiki/Motorola_68000": "The Motorola 68000 ( 'sixty-eight-thousand ' ; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k , sixty-eight-kay ) is a 16/32-bit CISC microprocessor , introduced in 1979 by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector . The design implements a 32-bit instruction set , with 32-bit registers and a 32-bit internal data bus . The address bus is 24-bits and does not use memory segmentation , which made it popular with programmers . Internally , it uses a 16-bit data ALU and two additional 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses , and has a 16-bit external data bus . For this reason , Motorola referred to it as a 16/32-bit processor . As one of the first widely available processors with a 32-bit instruction set , and running at relatively high speeds for the era , the 68k was a popular design through the 1980s . It was widely used in a new generation of personal computers with graphical user interfaces , including the Apple Macintosh , Commodore Amiga , Atari ST and many others . It competed primarily against the Intel 8088 , found in the IBM PC , which it easily outperformed . The 68k and 8088 pushed other designs , like the Zilog Z8000 and National Semiconductor 32016 , into niche markets , and made Motorola a major player in the CPU space . The 68k was soon expanded with additional family members , implementing full 32-bit ALUs as part of the growing Motorola 68000 series . The original 68k is generally software forward-compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus . After 40 years in production , the 68000 architecture is still in use .",

It was popular for industrial control systems in the late 1980s and early 1990s before the ubiquitous IBM PC dominated this market . It remains a well-designed standard . Although no longer competitive in its original market , it is valid choice for hobbyists wishing to make 'home brew ' computer systems . The Z80 and probably the CMOS 65C02 would be good processors to use . The standardized bus would allow hobbyists to interface to each other 's designs .",

The experience gained in developing this modular system strongly influenced the design of Acorn 's first all-in-one home computer , the Acorn Atom , released in March 1980 ; and also much of the circuitry in its successor , the BBC Micro , first shown in late 1981 . Acorn 's final rack-based machine was the System 5 , released in late 1982 . The Eurocard business was then sold on to one of its principal resellers , Control Universal Ltd , which continued to develop various cards for industrial use based on the Acorn-standard bus during the 1980s , but ultimately went into receivership in 1989 .",
  "/wiki/Industry_Standard_Architecture": "Industry Standard Architecture ( ISA ) is the 16-bit internal bus of IBM PC/AT and similar computers based on the Intel 80286 and its immediate successors during the 1980s . The bus was ( largely ) backward compatible with the 8-bit bus of the 8088-based IBM PC , including the IBM PC/XT as well as IBM PC compatibles . Originally referred to as the PC/AT-bus , it was also termed I/O Channel by IBM . The ISA term was coined as a retronym by competing PC-clone manufacturers in the late 1980s or early 1990s as a reaction to IBM attempts to replace the AT-bus with its new and incompatible Micro Channel architecture . The 16-bit ISA bus was also used with 32-bit processors for several years . An attempt to extend it to 32 bits , called Extended Industry Standard Architecture ( EISA ) , was not very successful , however . Later buses such as VESA Local Bus and PCI were used instead , often along with ISA slots on the same mainboard . Derivatives of the AT bus structure were and still are used in ATA/IDE , the PCMCIA standard , Compact Flash , the PC/104 bus , and internally within Super I/O chips .",

The generic term personal computer ( PC ) was in use years before 1981 , applied as early as 1972 to the Xerox PARC 's Alto , but the term PC came to mean more specifically a desktop microcomputer compatible with IBM 's Personal Computer branded products . The machine was based on open architecture , and third-party suppliers sprang up to provide peripheral devices , expansion cards , and software . IBM had a substantial influence on the personal computer market in standardizing a platform for personal computers , and IBM compatible became an important criterion for sales growth . Only the Apple Macintosh family kept a significant share of the microcomputer market after the 1980s without compatibility to the IBM personal computer .",

  "/wiki/Amiga": "The Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in 1985 . The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM , mouse-based GUIs , and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems . This wave included the Atari ST - released the same year - Apple 's Macintosh , and later the Apple IIGS . Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor , the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound , including sprites and a blitter , and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS . The Amiga 1000 was released in July 1985 , but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986 . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold . The A3000 was introduced in 1990 , followed by the A500+ , and the A600 in March 1992 . Finally , the A1200 and the A4000 were released in late 1992 . The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos . It also found a prominent role in the desktop video , video production , and show control business , leading to video editing systems such as the Video Toaster . The Amiga 's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early tracker music software . The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages , including LightWave 3D , Imagine , Aladdin4D , TurboSilver and Traces , a predecessor to Blender .",
  "/wiki/Extended_Industry_Standard_Architecture": "The Extended Industry Standard Architecture ( in practice almost always shortened to EISA and frequently pronounced eee-suh ) is a bus standard for IBM PC compatible computers . It was announced in September 1988 by a consortium of PC clone vendors ( the Gang of Nine ) as a counter to IBM 's use of its proprietary Micro Channel architecture ( MCA ) in its PS/2 series . In comparison with the AT bus , which the Gang of Nine retroactively renamed to the ISA bus to avoid infringing IBM 's trademark on its PC/AT computer , EISA is extended to 32 bits and allows more than one CPU to share the bus . The bus mastering support is also enhanced to provide access to 4 GB of memory . Unlike MCA , EISA can accept older XT and ISA boards - the lines and slots for EISA are a superset of ISA . EISA was much favoured by manufacturers due to the proprietary nature of MCA , and even IBM produced some machines supporting it . It was somewhat expensive to implement ( though not as much as MCA ) , so it never became particularly popular in desktop PCs . However , it was reasonably successful in the server market , as it was better suited to bandwidth-intensive tasks ( such as disk access and networking ) . Most EISA cards produced were either SCSI or network cards . EISA was also available on some non-IBM-compatible machines such as the AlphaServer , HP 9000-D , SGI Indigo2 and MIPS Magnum . By the time there was a strong market need for a bus of these speeds and capabilities for desktop computers , the VESA Local Bus and later PCI filled this niche , and EISA vanished into obscurity .",
  "/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible": "IBM PC compatible computers are similar to the original IBM PC , XT , and AT that are able to use the same software and expansion cards . Such computers were referred to as PC clones , or IBM clones . The term IBM PC compatible is now a historical description only , since IBM no longer sells personal computers . The industry jargon PC sometimes does n't mean personal computer generally , but rather a computer running Microsoft Windows , in contrast to Apple 's Mac . These clones duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the IBM PC architecture . This was facilitated by IBM 's choice of commodity hardware components and by various manufacturers ' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a clean room design technique . Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS . [ citation needed ] Early IBM PC compatibles used the same computer bus as the original PC and AT models . The IBM AT compatible bus was later named the Industry Standard Architecture ( ISA ) bus by manufacturers of compatible computers . Descendants of the IBM PC compatibles comprise the majority of personal computers on the market presently , with the dominant operating system being Microsoft Windows , although interoperability with the bus structure and peripherals of the original PC architecture may be limited or non-existent . Some of these computers ran MS-DOS but had enough hardware differences that IBM compatible software could not be used ; examples include slight differences in the memory map , serial ports or video hardware .

NeXT was founded by Jobs after he was fired from Apple , along with several co-workers . NeXT introduced the first NeXT Computer in 1988 , and the smaller NeXTstation in 1990 . The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales , with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total . Nevertheless , their innovative object-oriented NeXTSTEP operating system and development environment ( Interface Builder ) were highly influential .

  "/wiki/Amiga_Zorro_III": "Released as the expansion bus of the Commodore Amiga 3000 in 1990 , the Zorro III computer bus was used to attach peripheral devices to an Amiga motherboard . Designed by Commodore International lead engineer Dave Haynie , the 32-bit Zorro III replaced the 16-bit Zorro II bus used in the Amiga 2000 . As with the Zorro II bus , Zorro III allowed for true Plug and Play autodetection ( similar to , and prior to , the PC 's PCI bus ) wherein devices were dynamically allocated the resources they needed on boot . Zorro III continued Zorro II 's direct memory-mapped address design ( unlike 80x86 processors , the MC68K family used in the Amiga did not have a separate I/O address mechanism ) . Just as with Zorro II on 24-bit systems , Zorro III reserved a large chunk of 32-bit real memory address space for large memory mapped cards , a smaller chunk with smaller allocation granularity for I/O type board . Zorro III was never supported on 24-bit address or 16-bit data devices - it required a full 32-bit CPU . The CPU could directly address any Zorro III device as memory , so Zorro memory expansions could be made ( and were made ) as well as it being possible to use video memory on a video card to be as system RAM . As an asynchronous bus , Zorro III specified bus cycles of set lengths during which a transaction conforming to the specifications of the bus could be carried out . The initial implementation of Zorro III was in Commodore 's Fat Buster ( BUS conTrollER ) gate array , assisted by a very high speed PAL and numerous TTL buffer chips for bus buffering , isolation , and multiplexing . The Amiga 4000 implementation was fundamentally the same , but integrated a second gate-array to replace the TTL buffers . The Buster chip provided bus arbitration , translation between the MC68030 bus protocols and either Zorro II or Zorro III bus cycles ( geographically mapped based on the Zorro bus address ) , and a vectored interrupt mechanism , generally not used . Zorro II bus masters were legal bus hogs , but Zorro III devices were fairly arbitrated and had controller-limited bus tenure .",
  "/wiki/Processor_Direct_Slot": "The Processor Direct Slot or PDS , introduced by Apple Computer , in several of their Macintosh models , provided a limited measure of hardware expandability , without going to the expense ( in terms of desk space as well as selling price ) of providing full-fledged bus expansion slots . Typically , a machine would feature multiple bus expansions slots , if any . However , there was never more than one PDS slot . Rather than providing a sophisticated communication protocol with arbitration between different bits of hardware that might be trying to use the communication channel at the same time , the PDS slot , for the most part , just gave direct access to signal pins on the CPU , making it closer in nature to a local bus . Thus , PDS slots tended to be CPU-specific , and therefore a card designed for the PDS slot in the Motorola 68030-based Macintosh SE/30 , for example , would not work in the Motorola 68040-based Quadra 700 . The one notable exception to this was the PDS design for the original Motorola 68020-based Macintosh LC . This was Apple 's first attempt at a low-cost Mac , and it was such a success that , when subsequent models replaced the CPU with a 68030 , a 68040 , and later a PowerPC processor , Apple found methods to keep the PDS slot compatible with the original LC , so that the same expansion cards would continue to work .",

  "/wiki/Conventional_PCI": "Conventional PCI , often shortened to PCI , is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer . PCI is an abbreviation for Peripheral Component Interconnect and is part of the PCI Local Bus standard . The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor 's native bus . Devices connected to the PCI bus appear to a bus master to be connected directly to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the processor 's address space . It is a parallel bus , synchronous to a single bus clock . Attached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself ( called a planar device in the PCI specification ) or an expansion card that fits into a slot . The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles , where it displaced the combination of several slow ISA slots and one fast VESA Local Bus slot as the bus configuration . It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types . Typical PCI cards used in PCs include : network cards , sound cards , modems , extra ports such as USB or serial , TV tuner cards and disk controllers . PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI . The preferred interface for video cards then became AGP , itself a superset of PCI , before giving way to PCI Express . The first version of PCI found in retail desktop computers was a 32-bit bus using a 33 MHz bus clock and 5 V signalling , although the PCI 1.0 standard provided for a 64-bit variant as well .",
