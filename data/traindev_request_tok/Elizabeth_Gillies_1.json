  "/wiki/The_Black_Donnellys": "The Black Donnellys is an American drama television series that debuted on NBC on February 26 , 2007 and last aired on April 2 , 2007 . Thereafter , NBC began releasing new episodes weekly on NBC.com [ citation needed ] until the series was cancelled . The Black Donnellys was created by Paul Haggis and Robert Moresco featured in the cast Jonathan Tucker , Olivia Wilde , Billy Lush , Tom Guiry , Kirk Acevedo , and relative newcomers Michael Stahl-David and Keith Nobbs . The series follows four young Roman Catholic Irish-American brothers in New York City 's Hell 's Kitchen neighborhood , and their involvement with petty and organized crime . Set in the present day , the show draws heavily upon Irish-American history and iconic themes . The pilot episode illustrates a clear tension and rivalry between Irish and Italians . The episodes are narrated by a childhood friend , Joey Ice Cream , whom the show depicts as an unreliable narrator . In creating the show , Haggis , a native of London , Ontario , strongly referenced his hometown 's local history about the real-life Black Donnellys and the massacre associated with their name . In the pilot episode , Joey says the neighborhood is populated primarily by Black Irish , whom he calls a race of dark-haired people the Celts had failed to wipe out in Ireland . Hell 's Kitchen in the series is also a fairly faithful depiction - a traditionally working-class neighborhood with a deeply entrenched ethnic Irish population and an Irish Mob with control over illegal gambling and loansharking , and heavy involvement in the unions . On April 2 , 2007 , NBC announced that the series would be pulled after the April 16 episode , presumably because of insufficient viewership , and that unaired episodes would be streamed online on NBC.com , as well as downloadable from iTunes . The show 's NBC TV time slot was filled by the second and third episodes of the US version of Thank God You 're Here on April 9 and 16 , after which the time slot was filled by the series The Real Wedding Crashers .",

Unlike MacFarlane 's other shows , Family Guy and , to a lesser extent , The Cleveland Show , American Dad ! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags , and is less concerned with conventional setup-punchline jokes , instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters , the relationships between family members , and the relatively relatable plots . While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes , the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements , pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce . The plots are often absurd , but they are grounded by family stories and real-world issues .",
