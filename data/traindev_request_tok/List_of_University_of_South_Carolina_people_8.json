  "/wiki/U.S._Ambassador": "Ambassadors of the United States are persons nominated as ambassadors by the President to serve as United States diplomats to individual nations of the world , to international organizations , and as ambassadors-at-large . Their appointment needs to be confirmed by the United States Senate . An ambassador can be appointed during a recess , but he or she can only serve as ambassador until the end of the next session of Congress unless subsequently confirmed . Ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the President , meaning they can be dismissed at any time . Appointments change regularly for various reasons , such as reassignment or retirement . An ambassador may be a career Foreign Service Officer ( career diplomat - CD ) or a political appointee ( PA ) . In most cases , career foreign service officers serve a tour of approximately three years per ambassadorship whereas political appointees customarily tender their resignations upon the inauguration of a new president . As embassies fall under the State Department 's jurisdiction , ambassadors answer directly to the Secretary of State . The United States Department of State provides lists of ambassadors which are updated periodically . ( A recent list was issued on December 4 , 2018 . A further 24 nominees were confirmed on January 2 , 2019 , and a number of ambassadorships remain vacant . ) A listing by country of past chiefs of mission is maintained by the Office of the Historian of the U.S. Department of State .",

The part of Africa now known as Malawi was settled by migrating Bantu groups around the 10th century . Centuries later in 1891 the area was colonised by the British . In 1953 Malawi , then known as Nyasaland , a protectorate of the United Kingdom , became a protectorate within the semi-independent Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland . The Federation was dissolved in 1963 . In 1964 the protectorate over Nyasaland was ended and Nyasaland became an independent country under Queen Elizabeth II with the new name Malawi .",

These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",

A leading U.S. counter-terrorism , counterintelligence , and criminal investigative organization , the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes . Although many of the FBI 's functions are unique , its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and the Russian FSB . Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad , the FBI is primarily a domestic agency , maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States , and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation . At an FBI field office , a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence . Despite its domestic focus , the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint , operating 60 Legal Attache ( LEGAT ) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe . These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries . The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas , just as the CIA has a limited domestic function ; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies . The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation , the BOI or BI for short . Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in 1935 . The FBI headquarters is the J.
