  "/wiki/Malayo-Polynesian_languages": "The Malayo-Polynesian languages are a subgroup of the Austronesian languages , with approximately 385.5 million speakers . The Malayo-Polynesian languages are spoken by the Austronesian peoples of the island nations of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean , with a smaller number in continental Asia , going well into the Malay peninsula . Cambodia , Vietnam and the Chinese island Hainan serve as the northwest geographic outlier . The northernmost geographical outlier does not pass beyond the north of Pattani , which is located in southern Thailand . Malagasy is spoken in the island of Madagascar located off the eastern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean . Part of the language family shows a strong influence of Sanskrit and Arabic as the western part of the region has been a stronghold of Hinduism , Buddhism and , later , Islam . Two morphological characteristics of the Malayo-Polynesian languages are a system of affixation and the reduplication ( repetition of all or part of a word , such as wiki-wiki ) to form new words . Like other Austronesian languages they have small phonemic inventories ; thus a text has few but frequent sounds . The majority also lack consonant clusters ( e.g. , [ str ] in English ) . Most also have only a small set of vowels , five being a common number .",

  "/wiki/Unclassified_languages": "An unclassified language is a language whose genetic affiliation to other languages has not been established . Languages can be unclassified for a variety of reasons , mostly due to a lack of reliable data but sometimes due to the confounding influence of language contact , if different layers of its vocabulary or morphology point in different directions and it is not clear which represents the ancestral form of the language . Some poorly known extinct languages , such as Gutian and Cac\u00e1n , are simply unclassifiable , and it is unlikely the situation will ever change . A supposedly unclassified language may turn out not to be a language at all , or even a distinct dialect , but merely a family , tribal or village name , or an alternative name for a people or language that is classified . If a language 's genetic relationship has not been established after significant documentation of the language and comparison with other languages and families , as in the case of Basque in Europe , it is considered a language isolate - that is , it is classified as a language family of its own . An 'unclassified ' language therefore is one which may still turn out to belong to an established family once better data is available or more thorough comparative research is done . Extinct unclassified languages for which little evidence has been preserved are likely to remain in limbo indefinitely , unless lost documents or a surviving speaking population are discovered .",

The Dutch were active in the fur trade beginning early in the seventeenth century , establishing trading posts in New Netherland , the name for the Dutch territory of the Middle Atlantic and exchanging trade goods for furs . Pidgin languages characteristically arise from interactions between speakers of two or more languages who are not bilingual in the other group 's language .

  "/wiki/Pidgin": "A pidgin /\u02c8p\u026ad\u0292\u026an/ , or pidgin language , is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups that do not have a language in common : typically , its vocabulary and grammar are limited and often drawn from several languages . It is most commonly employed in situations such as trade , or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside ( but where there is no common language between the groups ) . Fundamentally , a pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication , as it is constructed impromptu , or by convention , between individuals or groups of people . A pidgin is not the native language of any speech community , but is instead learned as a second language . A pidgin may be built from words , sounds , or body language from a multitude of languages as well as onomatopoeia . As the lexicon of any pidgin will be limited to core vocabulary , words with only a specific meaning in lexifier language may acquire a completely new ( or additional ) meaning in the pidgin . Pidgins have historically been considered a form of patois , unsophisticated simplified versions of their lexifiers , and as such usually have low prestige with respect to other languages . However , not all simplified or unsophisticated forms of a language are pidgins . Each pidgin has its own norms of usage which must be learned for proficiency in the pidgin . A pidgin differs from a creole , which is the first language of a speech community of native speakers that at one point arose from a pidgin . Unlike pidgins , creoles have fully developed vocabulary and patterned grammar . Most linguists believe that a creole develops through a process of nativization of a pidgin when children of acquired pidgin-speakers learn and use it as their native language .",

Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix .

Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name .

The term rural sign language refers to almost the same concept . In many cases , the sign language is known throughout the community by a large portion of the hearing population . These languages generally include signs derived from gestures used by the hearing population , so that neighboring village sign languages may be lexically similar without being actually related , due to local similarities in cultural gestures which preceded the sign languages . Most village sign languages are endangered due to the spread of formal education for the deaf , which use or generate Deaf-community sign languages , such as a national or foreign sign language .

  "/wiki/Iranian_languages": "The Iranian or Iranic languages are a branch of the Indo-Iranian languages in the Indo-European language family that are spoken natively by the Iranian peoples . The Iranian languages are grouped in three stages : Old Iranian ( until 400 BC ) , Middle Iranian ( 400 BC - 900 AD ) , and New Iranian ( since 900 AD ) . The two directly attested Old Iranian languages are Old Persian ( from the Achaemenid Empire ) and Old Avestan ( the language of the Avesta ) . Of the Middle Iranian languages , the better understood and recorded ones are Middle Persian ( from the Sasanian Empire ) , Parthian ( from the Parthian Empire ) , and Bactrian ( from the Kushan and Hephthalite empires ) . As of 2008 , there were an estimated 150-200 million native speakers of the Iranian languages . Ethnologue estimates that there are 86 Iranian languages , the largest among them being Persian , Pashto , and the Kurdish languages .",

In the 2nd century BCE , Egyptian began to be written in the Coptic alphabet , which is an adaptation of the Greek alphabet with the addition of six or seven signs from the Demotic Egyptian to compensate the absence of the Afro-Asiatic sounds that the Greek language did not have . Several distinct Coptic dialects are identified , the most prominent of which are Sahidic , originating in parts of Upper Egypt and Bohairic , originally from the western Nile Delta in Lower Egypt . Coptic and Demotic are grammatically closely related to Late Egyptian , which was written with Egyptian hieroglyphs . Coptic flourished as a literary language from the 2nd to 13th centuries and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria . It was supplanted by Egyptian Arabic as a spoken language toward the early modern period , but language revitalization efforts have been underway since the 19th century .",
  "/wiki/Afro-Asiatic_languages": "Afroasiatic ( Afro-Asiatic ) , also known as Afrasian and in older sources as Hamito-Semitic ( Chamito-Semitic ) or Semito-Hamitic , is a large language family of about 300 languages that are spoken predominantly in West Asia , North Africa , the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel . Afroasiatic languages have over 495 million native speakers , the fourth largest number of any language family ( after Indo-European , Sino-Tibetan and Niger-Congo ) . The phylum has six branches : Berber , Chadic , Cushitic , Egyptian , Omotic and Semitic . By far the most widely spoken Afroasiatic language or dialect continuum is Arabic . A de facto group of distinct language varieties within the Semitic branch , the languages that evolved from Proto-Arabic have around 313 million native speakers , concentrated primarily in West Asia and North Africa . In addition to languages spoken today , Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages , such as Ancient Egyptian , which forms a distinct branch of the family , and Akkadian , Biblical Hebrew and Old Aramaic , all of which are from the Semitic branch . The original homeland of the Afroasiatic family , and when the parent language ( i.e . Proto-Afroasiatic ) was spoken , are yet to be agreed upon by historical linguists . Proposed locations include North Africa , the Horn of Africa , the Eastern Sahara and the Levant .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",
  "/wiki/Curonian_language": "The Curonian language ( German : Kurisch ; Latvian : kur\u0161u valoda ; Lithuanian : kur\u0161i\u0173 kalba ) , or Old Curonian , is a nearly unattested Baltic extinct language spoken by the Curonians , a Baltic tribe who inhabited the Courland Peninsula ( now western Latvia ) and the nearby Baltic shore . Curonian was a Baltic language ; some scholars consider it to have been an Eastern Baltic , intermediate between Lithuanian and Latvian , while others like Vytautas Ma\u017eiulis classify it as Western Baltic . Linguist Eduard V\u00e4\u00e4ri argues that it is possible that Curonians were Baltic Finns . The attested local Finnic language , Livonian , may be the source of Finnic elements in Curonian . [ citation needed ] . In 1912 Latvian linguist J\u0101nis Endzel\u012bns finally proved that Curonian was a Baltic language ; according to him , Curonian by its qualities was in between Lithuanian and Latvian languages . Old Curonian disappeared in the course of the 16th century , leaving substrata in western dialects of the Latvian and Lithuanian , namely the Samogitian dialect . No written documents in this language are known , but some ancient Lithuanian texts from western regions show some Curonian influence . According to Lithuanian linguist Zigmas Zinkevi\u010dius long and intense Curonian - Lithuanian bilingualism existed . There are attested names of the Curonian noblemen such as : Lammechinus [ lt ; lv ] , Velt\u016bnas , Reiginas , Tvertikis , Saveidis . Samogitian words such as kuisis ( a mosquito ) , pyl\u0117 ( a duck ) , blezdinga ( a swallow ) , cyrulis ( a skylark ) , zuikis ( a rabbit ) , k\u016blis ( a stone ) , purvs ( a marsh ) , p\u016brai ( a winter wheat ) considered to be of Curonian origin . After the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the Baltic states saw a revival of scientific and cultural interest in extinct Baltic languages and tribes , including Yotvingian , Curonian , and Old Prussian .",
  "/wiki/Latvia": "Latvia ( /\u02c8l\u0251\u02d0tvi\u0259/ or /\u02c8l\u00e6tvi\u0259/ ( listen ) ; Latvian : Latvija [ \u02c8latvija ] , Livonian : Le\u021bm\u014d ) , officially known as the Republic of Latvia ( Latvian : Latvijas Republika , Livonian : Le\u021bm\u014d Vab\u0101m\u014d ) , is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe . Since its independence , Latvia has been referred to as one of the Baltic states . It is bordered by Estonia to the north , Lithuania to the south , Russia to the east , Belarus to the southeast , and shares a maritime border with Sweden to the west . Latvia has 1,957,200 inhabitants and a territory of 64,589 km2 ( 24,938 sq mi ) . The country has a temperate seasonal climate . The Baltic Sea moderates climate , although it has four distinct seasons and snowy winters . After centuries of Swedish , Polish and Russian rule , a rule mainly executed by the Baltic German aristocracy , the Republic of Latvia was established on 18 November 1918 when it broke away from the Russian Empire and declared independence in the aftermath of World War I . However , by the 1930s the country became increasingly autocratic after the coup in 1934 establishing an authoritarian regime under K\u0101rlis Ulmanis . The country 's de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II , beginning with Latvia 's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union , followed by the invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and the re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944 ( Courland Pocket in 1945 ) to form the Latvian SSR for the next 45 years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the Communist regime 's illegal takeover . It ended with the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia on 4 May 1990 and restoring de facto independence on 21 August 1991 . Latvia is a democratic sovereign state , parliamentary republic and a very highly developed country according to the United Nations Human Development Index ."
