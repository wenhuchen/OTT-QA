It is located on the east coast of the Jutland peninsula , in the geographical centre of Denmark , 187 kilometres ( 116 mi ) northwest of Copenhagen and 289 kilometres ( 180 mi ) north of Hamburg , Germany . The inner urban area contains 273,077 inhabitants ( as of 1 January 2018 [ update ] ) and the municipal population is 340,421 ( as of 2018 [ update ] ) . Aarhus is the central city in Business Region Aarhus and in the East Jutland metropolitan area , which had a total population of 1.378 million in 2016 . The history of Aarhus began as a fortified Viking settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the bishopric seated here from at least 948 . The city was founded on the northern shores of a fjord at a natural harbour and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products . Market town privileges were granted in 1441 , but growth stagnated in the 17th century as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish Wars . In the 19th century it was occupied twice by German troops during the Schleswig Wars but avoided destruction . As the industrial revolution took hold , the city grew to become the second-largest in the country by the 20th century . Today , Aarhus is at the cultural and economic core of the region and the largest centre for trade , services , industry , and tourism in Jutland . The city ranks as the 92nd largest city in the European Union , and as number 234 among world cities . It is also a top 100 conference city in the world .",

The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",

  "/wiki/Medieval": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued .",

The church teaches that it is the One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic church established by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission , and that its bishops are the successors of Christ 's apostles . It maintains that it practices the original Christian faith , as passed down by holy tradition . Its patriarchates , reminiscent of the pentarchy , and autocephalous and autonomous churches reflect a variety of hierarchical organisation . It recognises seven major sacraments , of which the Eucharist is the principal one , celebrated liturgically in synaxis .

  "/wiki/Balkans": "The Balkans /\u02c8b\u0254\u02d0lk\u0259nz/ BAWL-k\u0259nz , also known as the Balkan Peninsula , is a geographic area in Southeast Europe with various definitions and meanings , including geopolitical and historical . The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch throughout the whole of Bulgaria from the Serbian-Bulgarian border to the Black Sea coast . The Balkan Peninsula is bordered by the Adriatic Sea in the northwest , the Ionian Sea in the southwest , the Aegean Sea in the south , the Turkish Straits in the east , and the Black Sea in the northeast . The northern border of the peninsula is variously defined . The highest point of the Balkans is Mount Musala , 2,925 metres ( 9,596 ft ) , in the Rila mountain range , Bulgaria . The concept of the Balkan peninsula was created by the German geographer August Zeune in 1808 , who mistakenly considered the Balkan Mountains the dominant mountain system of Southeast Europe spanning from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea . The term of Balkan Peninsula was a synonym for Rumelia ( European Turkey ) in the 19th century , the former provinces of the Ottoman Empire in Southeast Europe . It had a geopolitical rather than a geographical definition , further promoted during the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the early 20th century . The definition of the Balkan peninsula 's natural borders do not coincide with the technical definition of a peninsula and hence modern geographers reject the idea of a Balkan peninsula , while scholars usually discuss the Balkans as a region . The term has acquired a stigmatized and pejorative meaning related to the process of Balkanization , and hence the preferred alternative term used for the region is Southeast Europe .",

Bricks are laid in courses and numerous patterns known as bonds , collectively known as brickwork , and may be laid in various kinds of mortar to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure .",
  "/wiki/Byzantine_Empire": "The Byzantine Empire , also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire , or Byzantium , was the continuation of the Roman Empire in its eastern provinces during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages , when its capital city was Constantinople ( modern Istanbul , formerly Byzantium ) . It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural and military force in Europe . Byzantine Empire is a term created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire simply as the Roman Empire ( Greek : \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd , tr .

Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West diverged . Constantine I ( r. 324-337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379-395 ) , Christianity became the state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . In the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610-641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin . Although the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture and characterised by Eastern Orthodox Christianity . The borders of the empire fluctuated through cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527-565 ) , the empire reached its greatest extent , after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy and Rome , which it held for two more centuries .",

It began on 26 October 1185 , the feast day of St. Demetrius of Thessaloniki , and ended with the restoration of Bulgaria with the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire , ruled by the Asen dynasty . Isaac II Angelus , in order to raise money for his wedding with the daughter of King B\u00e9la III of Hungary , levied a new tax which fell heavily on the population of the Haemus Mountains . They sent two leaders ( Peter and Asen ) to negotiate with the emperor at Kypsella ( now \u0130psala ) in Thrace . They asked to be added to the roll of the Byzantine army and to be granted land near Haemus to provide the monetary income needed to pay the tax . This was refused , and Peter and Asen were treated roughly . Their response was to threaten revolt . After their return , many of the protesters were unwilling to join the rebellion . The brothers Peter and Asen built the Church of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki in Tarnovo , dedicated to Saint Demetrius , who was traditionally considered a patron of the Byzantine city of Thessaloniki , and claimed that the Saint had ceased to favour the Byzantines : God had decided to free the Bulgarians and the Vlach people and to lift the yoke that they had borne for so long . This persuaded their followers to attack Byzantine cities , seizing prisoners and cattle . Preslav , capital of the First Bulgarian Empire , was raided , and it was after this symbolic incident that Peter assumed the insignia of Tsar ( or Emperor ) .

  "/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox": "The Eastern Orthodox Church , officially the Orthodox Catholic Church , is the second-largest Christian church , with approximately 260 million baptised members . It operates as a communion of autocephalous churches , each governed by its bishops in local synods . Roughly half of Eastern Orthodox Christians live in Russia . The church has no central doctrinal or governmental authority analogous to the Bishop of Rome , but the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is recognised by all as primus inter pares ( first among equals ) of the bishops . As one of the oldest surviving religious institutions in the world , the Eastern Orthodox Church has played a prominent role in the history and culture of Eastern and Southeastern Europe , the Caucasus , and the Near East . Eastern Orthodox theology is based on the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed ( known simply as the Nicene Creed ) . The church teaches that it is the One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic church established by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission , and that its bishops are the successors of Christ 's apostles . It maintains that it practices the original Christian faith , as passed down by holy tradition . Its patriarchates , reminiscent of the pentarchy , and autocephalous and autonomous churches reflect a variety of hierarchical organisation . It recognises seven major sacraments , of which the Eucharist is the principal one , celebrated liturgically in synaxis . The church teaches that through consecration invoked by a priest , the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ . The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the God-bearer , honoured in devotions .",
  "/wiki/Basilica": "The Latin word basilica ( derived from Greek : \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ac , Royal Stoa , the tribunal chamber of a king ) has three distinct applications in modern English . Originally , the word was used to refer to an ancient Roman public building , where courts were held , as well as serving other official and public functions . It usually had the door at one end and a slightly raised platform and an apse at the other , where the magistrate or other officials were seated . The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town , usually adjacent to the main forum . Subsequently , the basilica was not built near a forum but adjacent to a palace and was known as a palace basilica . Secondly , as the Roman Empire adopted Christianity , the major church buildings were typically constructed with this basic architectural plan and thus it became popular throughout Europe . It continues to be used in an architectural sense to describe rectangular buildings with a central nave and aisles , and usually a raised platform at the opposite end from the door . In Europe and the Americas the basilica remained the most common architectural style for churches of all Christian denominations , though this building plan has become less dominant in new buildings since the latter 20th century . Thirdly , the term refers to an official designation of a certain kind of church in the Roman Catholic Church : a large and important place of worship that has been given special ceremonial rights by the Pope , whatever its architectural plan . These are divided into : major basilicas - numbering only four , all of which are ancient churches located within Rome - and minor basilicas - found all around the world and which , as of 2019 [ update ] , number 1,810 . These major and minor basilicas are commonly simply referred to as basilicas . Some Catholic basilicas are Catholic pilgrimage sites , receiving tens of millions of visitors per year .",

  "/wiki/Middle_Ages": "In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages ( or medieval period ) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century . It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery . The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history : classical antiquity , the medieval period , and the modern period . The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages . Population decline , counterurbanisation , collapse of centralized authority , invasions , and mass migrations of tribes , which had begun in Late Antiquity , continued in the Early Middle Ages . The large-scale movements of the Migration Period , including various Germanic peoples , formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire . In the 7th century , North Africa and the Middle East - once part of the Byzantine Empire - came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate , an Islamic empire , after conquest by Muhammad 's successors . Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures , the break with classical antiquity was not complete . The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire , Rome 's direct continuation , survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power . The empire 's law code , the Corpus Juris Civilis or Code of Justinian , was rediscovered in Northern Italy in 1070 and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages . In the West , most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions . Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued .",
  "/wiki/Christianity": "Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth . Its adherents , known as Christians , believe that Jesus is the Christ , whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible , called the Old Testament in Christianity , and chronicled in the New Testament . It is the world 's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers . Christianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea . Jesus ' apostles and their followers spread around Syria , the Levant , Europe , Anatolia , Mesopotamia , Transcaucasia , Egypt , and Ethiopia , despite initial persecution . It soon attracted gentile God-fearers , which led to a departure from Jewish customs , and , after the Fall of Jerusalem , AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism , Christianity slowly separated from Judaism . Emperor Constantine the Great converted to Christianity before his death ( 337 ) , and was baptized by bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia ; Constantine decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan ( 313 ) , later convening the Council of Nicaea ( 325 ) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the State church of the Roman Empire ( 380 ) . The early history of Christianity 's united church before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the Great Church . The Church of the East split after the Council of Ephesus ( 431 ) and Oriental Orthodoxy split after the Council of Chalcedon ( 451 ) over differences in Christology , while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East-West Schism ( 1054 ) , especially over the authority of the bishop of Rome . Similarly , Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Latin Catholic Church in the Reformation era ( 16th century ) over theological and ecclesiological disputes , most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome . Following the Age of Discovery ( 15th-17th century ) , Christianity was spread into the Americas , Oceania , sub-Saharan Africa , and the rest of the world via missionary work . Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches , as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation , ecclesiology , ordination , and Christology .",
  "/wiki/Apostle_(Christian)": "In Christian theology and ecclesiology , apostles , particularly the Twelve Apostles ( also known as the Twelve Disciples or simply the Twelve ) , were the primary disciples of Jesus according to the New Testament . In addition to Christian theology , Islamic theology also acknowledges the apostles in the Quran . During the life and ministry of Jesus in the 1st century AD , the apostles were his closest followers and became the primary teachers of the gospel message of Jesus . While Christian tradition often refers to the apostles as being twelve in number , different gospel writers give different names for the same individual , and apostles mentioned in one gospel are not mentioned in others . There is also an Eastern Christian tradition derived from the Gospel of Luke of there having been as many as 70 apostles during the time of Jesus ' ministry . Paul is often referred to as an apostle , because he was directly taught and commissioned by a vision of Christ ( Acts 9:4-9 ) during his journey to Damascus . The commissioning of the Twelve Apostles during the ministry of Jesus is recorded in the Synoptic Gospels . After his resurrection , Jesus sent eleven of them ( minus Judas Iscariot , who by then had died ) by the Great Commission to spread his teachings to all nations . This event has been called the Dispersion of the Apostles . In modern usage , missionaries under Pentecostal movements often refer to themselves as apostles , a practice which stems from the Latin equivalent of apostle , i.e . missio , the source of the English word missionary . For example , Saint Patrick ( AD 373-463 ) was the Apostle of Ireland , Saint Boniface ( 680-755 ) was the Apostle to the Germans , Saint Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta ( 1534-1597 ) was the Apostle of Brazil and Saint Peter of Betancur ( 1626-1667 ) was the Apostle of Guatemala .",

Paul is generally considered one of the most important figures of the Apostolic Age and from the mid-30s to the mid-50s AD he founded several Christian communities in Asia Minor and Europe . He took advantage of his status as both a Jew and a Roman citizen to minister to both Jewish and Roman audiences . According to the New Testament book Acts of the Apostles ( often simply called Acts ) , Paul persecuted some of the early disciples of Jesus , possibly Hellenised diaspora Jews converted to Christianity , in the area of Jerusalem prior to his conversion . [ note 1 ] In the narrative of Acts , Paul was traveling on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus on a mission to arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem when the resurrected Jesus appeared to him in a great light . He was struck blind , but after three days his sight was restored by Ananias of Damascus and Paul began to preach that Jesus of Nazareth is the Jewish Messiah and the Son of God .

  "/wiki/Column": "A column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits , through compression , the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below . In other words , a column is a compression member . The term column applies especially to a large round support ( the shaft of the column ) with a capital and a base or pedestal , which is made of stone , or appearing to be so . A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post , and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers . For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering , columns may be designed to resist lateral forces . Other compression members are often termed columns because of the similar stress conditions . Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest .

  "/wiki/Tracery": "In architecture , tracery is the stonework elements that support the glass in a Gothic window .

The evolving style from Romanesque to Gothic architecture and changing features , like the thinning of lateral walls and enlarging of windows lead to the innovation of tracery . The earliest form of tracery , called plate tracery , began as openings that were pierced from a stone slab . Bar tracery was then implemented , having derived from the plate tracery . However instead of a slab , the windows were defined by molded stone mullions which were lighter and allowed for more openings and intricate designs . Other notable styles of tracery to follow include geometrical tracery and curvilinear ( flowing ) tracery .",

Iconostasis also refers to a portable icon stand that can be placed anywhere within a church . The iconostasis evolved from the Byzantine templon , a process complete by the 15th century . A direct comparison for the function of the main iconostasis can be made to the layout of the great Temple in Jerusalem . That Temple was designed with three parts . The holiest and inner-most portion was that where the Ark of the Covenant was kept . This portion , the Holy of Holies , was separated from the second larger part of the building 's interior by a curtain , the veil of the temple . Only the High Priest was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies . The third part was the entrance court . This architectural tradition for the two main parts can be seen carried forward in Christian churches and is still most demonstratively present in Eastern Orthodox churches where the iconostasis divides the altar , the Holy of Holies where the Eucharist is performed - the manifestation of the New Covenant - from the larger portion of the church accessible to the faithful . In the Eastern Orthodox tradition only men can enter the altar portion behind the iconostasis . However one will see women serving behind the iconostasis at female monasteries .",

  "/wiki/List_of_Bulgarian_rulers": "The monarchs of Bulgaria ruled the country during three periods of its history as an independent country : from the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 to the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria in 1018 ; from the Uprising of Asen and Peter that established the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185 to the annexation of the rump Bulgarian principality into the Ottoman Empire in 1396 ; and from the re-establishment of an independent Bulgaria in 1878 to the abolition of monarchy in a referendum held on 15 September 1946 . Early Bulgarian rulers possibly used the title Kanasubigi ( Khan ) , later knyaz ( prince ) for a brief period , and subsequently tsar ( emperor ) . The title tsar , the Bulgarian form of the Latin Caesar , was first adopted and used in Bulgaria by Simeon I , following a decisive victory over the Byzantine Empire in 913 . It was also used by all of Simeon I 's successors until the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule in 1396 . After Bulgaria 's liberation from the Ottomans in 1878 , its first monarch Alexander I adopted the title knyaz , or prince . However , when de jure independence was proclaimed under his successor Ferdinand in 1908 , the title was elevated to the customary tsar once more . The use of tsar continued under Ferdinand and later under his heirs Boris III and Simeon II until the abolition of monarchy in 1946 . While the title tsar was translated as emperor in the First and Second Bulgarian Empires , it was translated as king in modern Bulgaria . In the few surviving medieval Bulgarian royal charters , the monarchs of Bulgaria styled themselves as In Christ the Lord Faithful Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians or similar variations , sometimes including . and Romans , Greeks , or Vlachs . This list does not include the mythical Bulgar rulers and the rulers of Old Great Bulgaria listed in the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans as well as unsuccessful claimants to the throne who are not generally listed among the Bulgarian monarchs .",

  "/wiki/Black_Sea": "The Black Sea is a body of water and marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean between Eastern Europe , the Caucasus , and Western Asia . It is supplied by a number of major rivers , such as the Danube , Dnieper , Southern Bug , Dniester , Don , and the Rioni . The watersheds of many countries drain into the Black Sea beyond the six that immediately border it . The Black Sea has an area of 436,400 km2 ( 168,500 sq mi ) ( not including the Sea of Azov ) , a maximum depth of 2,212 m ( 7,257 ft ) , and a volume of 547,000 km3 ( 131,000 cu mi ) . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south , Caucasus Mountains to the east , Crimean Mountains to the north , Strandzha to the southwest , Balkan Mountains to the west , Dobrogea Plateau to the northwest , and features a wide shelf to the northwest . The longest east-west extent is about 1,175 km ( 730 mi ) . Important cities along the coast include Odessa , Sevastopol , Samsun , and Istanbul . The Black Sea is bordered by Ukraine , Romania , Bulgaria , Turkey , Georgia , and Russia . It has a positive water balance ; that is , a net outflow of water 300 km3 ( 72 cu mi ) per year through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles into the Aegean Sea . There is a two-way hydrological exchange : the more saline and therefore denser , but warmer , Mediterranean water flows into the Black Sea under its less saline outflow . This creates a significant anoxic layer well below the surface waters . The Black Sea drains into the Mediterranean Sea , via the Aegean Sea and various straits , and is navigable to the Atlantic Ocean .",
