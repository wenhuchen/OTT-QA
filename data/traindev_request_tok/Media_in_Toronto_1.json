  "/wiki/AM_radio": "AM broadcasting is a radio broadcasting technology , which employs amplitude modulation ( AM ) transmissions . It was the first method developed for making audio radio transmissions , and is still used worldwide , primarily for medium wave ( also known as AM band ) transmissions , but also on the longwave and shortwave radio bands . The earliest experimental AM transmissions began in the early 1900s . However , widespread AM broadcasting was not established until the 1920s , following the development of vacuum tube receivers and transmitters . AM radio remained the dominant method of broadcasting for the next 30 years , a period called the Golden Age of Radio , until television broadcasting became widespread in the 1950s and received most of the programming previously carried by radio . Subsequently , AM radio 's audiences have also greatly shrunk due to competition from FM ( frequency modulation ) radio , Digital Audio Broadcasting ( DAB ) , satellite radio , HD ( digital ) radio and Internet streaming . AM transmissions are much more susceptible than FM or digital signals are to interference , and often have lower audio fidelity . Thus , AM broadcasters tend to specialise in spoken-word formats , such as talk radio , all news and sports , leaving the broadcasting of music mainly to FM and digital stations .",

  "/wiki/Sports_radio": "Sports radio ( or sports talk radio ) is a radio format devoted entirely to discussion and broadcasting of sporting events . A widespread programming genre that has a narrow audience appeal , sports radio is characterized by an often-boisterous on-air style and extensive debate and analysis by both hosts and callers . Many sports talk stations also carry play-by-play ( live commentary ) of local sports teams as part of their regular programming . Hosted by Bill Mazer , the first sports talk radio show in history launched in March 1964 on New York 's WNBC ( AM ) . Soon after WNBC launched its program , in 1965 Seton Hall University 's radio station , WSOU , started Hall Line , a call-in sports radio talk show focusing on the team 's basketball program . Having celebrated its 50th anniversary on air during the 2015-2016 season , Hall Line , which broadcasts to central and northern New Jersey as well as all five boroughs of New York , is the oldest and longest running sports talk call-in show in the NY-NJ Metropolitan area , and is believed to be the oldest in the nation . Enterprise Radio Network became the first national all-sports network , operating out of Avon , Connecticut , from New Year 's Day 1981 through late September of that year before going out of business . ER had two channels , one for talk and a second for updates and play-by-play . ER 's talk lineup included current New York Yankees voice John Sterling , New York Mets radio host Ed Coleman and former big-league pitcher Bill Denehy . Sports talk is available in local , network and syndicated forms , is available in multiple languages , and is carried in multiple forms on both major North American satellite radio networks . In the United States , most sports talk-formatted radio stations air syndicated programming from ESPN Radio , SB Nation Radio , Sports Byline USA , Fox Sports Radio , CBS Sports Radio , or NBC Sports Radio , while in the Spanish language , ESPN Deportes Radio is the largest current network . In contrast , Canadian sports talk stations may carry a national brand ( such as TSN Radio or Sportsnet Radio ) but carry mostly local programming , with American-based shows filling in gaps .",

  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further . Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as TuneIn , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm .",

Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists .

A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet .

The first language ( sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue ) is acquired without formal education , by mechanisms about which scholars disagree . Children acquiring two languages natively from these early years are called simultaneous bilinguals . It is common for young simultaneous bilinguals to be more proficient in one language than the other .

It is a global language , the world 's second-most spoken native language , after Mandarin Chinese , and the world 's fourth-most spoken language , after Mandarin Chinese , English and Hindi . Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages , which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century . The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century , and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo , a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile , in the 13th century . Beginning in 1492 , the Spanish language was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire , most notably to the Americas , as well as territories in Africa , Oceania and the Philippines . A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist Mario Pei , analyzing the degree of difference from a language 's parent ( Latin , in the case of Romance languages ) by comparing phonology , inflection , syntax , vocabulary , and intonation , indicated the following percentages ( the higher the percentage , the greater the distance from Latin ) : In the case of Spanish , it is one of the closest Romance languages to Latin ( 20% distance ) , only behind Sardinian ( 8% distance ) and Italian ( 12% distance ) . Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin , including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek . Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date , having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula . With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin , this language makes up the second greatest vocabulary source after Latin itself . It has also been influenced by Basque , Iberian , Celtiberian , Visigothic , and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages . Additionally , it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages , particularly other Romance languages - French , Italian , Andalusi Romance , Portuguese , Galician , Catalan , Occitan , and Sardinian - as well as from Quechua , Nahuatl , and other indigenous languages of the Americas . Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations .",
  "/wiki/Community_radio": "Community radio is a radio service offering a third model of radio broadcasting in addition to commercial and public broadcasting . Community stations serve geographic communities and communities of interest . They broadcast content that is popular and relevant to a local , specific audience but is often overlooked by commercial or mass-media broadcasters . Community radio stations are operated , owned , and influenced by the communities they serve . They are generally nonprofit and provide a mechanism for enabling individuals , groups , and communities to tell their own stories , to share experiences and , in a media-rich world , to become creators and contributors of media . In many parts of the world , community radio acts as a vehicle for the community and voluntary sector , civil society , agencies , NGOs and citizens to work in partnership to further community development aims , in addition to broadcasting . There is legally defined community radio ( as a distinct broadcasting sector ) in many countries , such as France , Argentina , South Africa , Australia and Ireland . Much of the legislation has included phrases such as social benefit , social objectives and social gain as part of the definition . Community radio has developed differently in different countries , and the term has somewhat different meanings in the United Kingdom , Ireland , the United States , Canada and Australia , where freedom of speech laws and de facto realities differ .",
