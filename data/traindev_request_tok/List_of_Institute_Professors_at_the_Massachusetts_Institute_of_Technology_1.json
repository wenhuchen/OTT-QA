  "/wiki/Motor_control": "Motor control is the regulation of movement in organisms that possess a nervous system . Motor control includes reflexes as well as directed movement . To control movement , the nervous system must integrate multimodal sensory information ( both from the external world as well as proprioception ) and elicit the necessary signals to recruit muscles to carry out a goal . This pathway spans many disciplines , including multisensory integration , signal processing , coordination , biomechanics , and cognition . Successful motor control is crucial to interacting with the world to carry out goals as well as to regulate balance and stability .",

  "/wiki/Branch_and_bound": "Branch and bound ( BB , B & B , or BnB ) is an algorithm design paradigm for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems , as well as mathematical optimization . A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search : the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root . The algorithm explores branches of this tree , which represent subsets of the solution set . Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch , the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution , and is discarded if it can not produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm . The algorithm depends on efficient estimation of the lower and upper bounds of regions/branches of the search space . If no bounds are available , the algorithm degenerates to an exhaustive search . The method was first proposed by Ailsa Land and Alison Doig whilst carrying out research at the London School of Economics sponsored by British Petroleum in 1960 for discrete programming , and has become the most commonly used tool for solving NP-hard optimization problems . The name branch and bound first occurred in the work of Little et al . on the traveling salesman problem .",

  "/wiki/Programming_languages": "A programming language is a formal language , which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output . Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms . Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers . There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions , rather than general programming languages . Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer , the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad , during the Islamic Golden Age . Since the early 1800s , programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms , music boxes and player pianos . The programs for these machines ( such as a player piano 's scrolls ) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions . Thousands of different programming languages have been created , and more are being created every year . Many programming languages are written in an imperative form ( i.e. , as a sequence of operations to perform ) while other languages use the declarative form ( i.e . the desired result is specified , not how to achieve it ) . The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax ( form ) and semantics ( meaning ) . Some languages are defined by a specification document ( for example , the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard ) while other languages ( such as Perl ) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference .",
  "/wiki/Noam_Chomsky": "Avram Noam Chomsky [ a ] ( born December 7 , 1928 ) is an American linguist , philosopher , cognitive scientist , historian , [ b ] [ c ] social critic , and political activist . Sometimes called the father of modern linguistics , [ d ] Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science . He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and Laureate Professor at the University of Arizona , and is the author of more than 100 books on topics such as linguistics , war , politics , and mass media . Ideologically , he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism . Born to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia , Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City . He studied at the University of Pennsylvania . During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows , Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955 . That year he began teaching at MIT , and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures , which played a major role in remodeling the study of language . From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study . He created or co-created the universal grammar theory , the generative grammar theory , the Chomsky hierarchy , and the minimalist program . Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism , and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner . An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War , which he saw as an act of American imperialism , in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay The Responsibility of Intellectuals .",
  "/wiki/Generative_grammar": "Generative grammar is a linguistic theory that regards linguistics as the study of a hypothesised innate grammatical structure . Similarly to some structuralist theories , such as glossematics , generative grammar considers grammar as a system of rules that generates exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences in a given language . The difference from structural and functional models is that the object is placed into the verb phrase in generative grammar . This theory was developed by Noam Chomsky in the 1950s . Linguists who follow the generative approach have been called generativists . The generative school has focused on the study of syntax and addressed other aspects of a language 's structure , including morphology and phonology . Early versions of Chomsky 's theory were called transformational grammar , a term still used to include his subsequent theories , the most recent of which is the minimalist program theory : Chomsky and other generativists have argued that many of the properties of a generative grammar arise from a universal grammar that is innate to the human brain , rather than being learned from the environment ( see the poverty of the stimulus argument ) . There are a number of versions of generative grammar currently practiced within linguistics . A contrasting approach is that of constraint-based grammars . Where a generative grammar attempts to list all the rules that result in all well-formed sentences , constraint-based grammars allow anything that is not otherwise constrained . Certain versions of dependency grammar , head-driven phrase structure grammar , lexical functional grammar , categorial grammar , relational grammar , link grammar , and tree-adjoining grammar are constraint-based grammars that have been proposed . In stochastic grammar , grammatical correctness is taken as a probabilistic variable , rather than a discrete ( yes or no ) property .",

The original Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 , and the current version of the Act , as amended , encompasses several social welfare and social insurance programs . Social Security is funded primarily through payroll taxes called Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax ( FICA ) or Self Employed Contributions Act Tax ( SECA ) . Tax deposits are collected by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and are formally entrusted to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund , the two Social Security Trust Funds . With a few exceptions , all salaried income , up to an amount specifically determined by law ( see tax rate table below ) , is subject to the Social Security payroll tax . All income over said amount is not taxed . In 2020 , the maximum amount of taxable earnings is $ 137,700 . With few exceptions , all legal residents working in the United States now have an individual Social Security number . Indeed , nearly all working ( and many non-working ) residents since Social Security 's 1935 inception have had a Social Security number because it is requested by a wide range of businesses . In 2017 , Social Security expenditures totaled $ 806.7 billion for OASDI and $ 145.8 billion for DI . Income derived from Social Security is currently estimated to have reduced the poverty rate for Americans age 65 or older from about 40% to below 10% .

  "/wiki/Ozone_depletion": "Ozone depletion consists of two related events observed since the late 1970s : a steady lowering of about four percent in the total amount of ozone in Earth 's atmosphere ( the ozone layer ) , and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone around Earth 's polar regions . The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole . There are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events in addition to these stratospheric events . In 2019 , NASA announced the ozone hole was the smallest ever since it was first discovered in 1982 . The main cause of ozone depletion and the ozone hole is manufactured chemicals , especially manufactured halocarbon refrigerants , solvents , propellants and foam-blowing agents ( chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) , HCFCs , halons ) , referred to as ozone-depleting substances ( ODS ) . These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by turbulent mixing after being emitted from the surface , mixing much faster than the molecules can settle . Once in the stratosphere , they release halogen atoms through photodissociation , which catalyze the breakdown of ozone ( O3 ) into oxygen ( O2 ) . Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halocarbons increased . Ozone depletion and the ozone hole have generated worldwide concern over increased cancer risks and other negative effects . The ozone layer prevents most harmful UV wavelengths of ultraviolet light ( UV light ) from passing through the Earth 's atmosphere . These wavelengths cause skin cancer , sunburn and cataracts , which were projected to increase dramatically as a result of thinning ozone , as well as harming plants and animals . These concerns led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987 , which bans the production of CFCs , halons and other ozone-depleting chemicals .",
