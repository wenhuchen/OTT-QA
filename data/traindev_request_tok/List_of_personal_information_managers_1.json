Lotus Agenda is a free-form information manager : the information need not be structured at all before it is entered into the database . A phrase such as See Wendy on Tuesday 3pm can be entered as is without any pre-processing . Its distinguishing feature was the ability to allow users to input data before the creation of database tables , giving the program flexibility to accommodate the myriad pieces of information a person may need to keep track of . The program was an attempt to create a spreadsheet for words . The computing industry was at first quite taken by its audacious goal and the power it brought to users as they were given a tool that allowed them to structure real life information in any way they wished . Its flexibility proved to be its weakness . New users confronted with so much flexibility were often overpowered by the steep learning curve required to use the program . Attempts to overcome this through packaging pre-built databases with the program were insufficient to lift sales to adequate levels . In the end only a few hundred thousand copies were sold . The program reached version 2.0b . Instead of porting Agenda to Windows , Lotus stopped development on this program and introduced a new PIM , Lotus Organizer , that uses the paper-based organizer metaphor , in its place .",

  "/wiki/Java_(programming_language)": "Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based , object-oriented , and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible . It is intended to let application developers write once , run anywhere ( WORA ) , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation . Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM ) regardless of the underlying computer architecture . The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++ , but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them . As of 2019 [ update ] , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub , particularly for client-server web applications , with a reported 9 million developers . Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems ( which has since been acquired by Oracle ) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . The original and reference implementation Java compilers , virtual machines , and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses . As of May 2007 , in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process , Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License . Meanwhile , others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies , such as the GNU Compiler for Java ( bytecode compiler ) , GNU Classpath ( standard libraries ) , and IcedTea-Web ( browser plugin for applets ) . The latest versions are Java 13 , released in September 2019 , and Java 11 , a currently supported long-term support ( LTS ) version , released on September 25 , 2018 ; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use , while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020 . Oracle ( and others ) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues . Since Java 9 ( and 10 and 12 ) is no longer supported , Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version ( currently Java 13 ) or an LTS release .",

The Macintosh operating system is credited with having popularized the graphical user interface concept . It was included with every Macintosh that was sold during the era in which it was developed , and many updates to the system software were done in conjunction with the introduction of new Macintosh systems . Apple released the original Macintosh on January 24 , 1984 . The first version of the system software , which had no official name , was partially based on the Lisa OS , which Apple previously released for the Lisa computer in 1983 . As part of an agreement allowing Xerox to buy shares in Apple at a favorable price , it also used concepts from the Xerox PARC Alto computer , which former Apple CEO Steve Jobs and other Lisa team members had previewed . This operating system consisted of the Macintosh Toolbox ROM and the System Folder , a set of files that were loaded from disk . The name Macintosh System Software came into use in 1987 with System 5 . Apple rebranded the system as Mac OS in 1996 , starting officially with version 7.6 , due in part to its Macintosh clone program . That program ended after the release of Mac OS 8 in 1997 .

The name stands for Operating System/2 , because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM 's Personal System/2 ( PS/2 ) line of second-generation personal computers . The first version of OS/2 was released in December 1987 and newer versions were released until December 2001 . OS/2 was intended as a protected-mode successor of PC DOS . Notably , basic system calls were modeled after MS-DOS calls ; their names even started with Dos and it was possible to create Family Mode applications - text mode applications that could work on both systems . Because of this heritage , OS/2 shares similarities with Unix , Xenix , and Windows NT . IBM discontinued its support for OS/2 on 31 December 2006 .

The word Lesser in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user 's complete freedom in the use of software ; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL , but not for any proprietary components .",

  "/wiki/Borland_Sidekick": "Borland Sidekick was a personal information manager ( PIM ) launched by American software company Borland in 1984 under Philippe Kahn 's leadership . It was an early and popular terminate and stay resident program ( TSR ) for MS-DOS which enabled computer users to activate the program using a hot key combination ( by default : Ctrl-Alt ) while working in other programs . Although a text-mode program , Sidekick 's window-based interface echoed that of the Apple Macintosh and anticipated the eventual look of Microsoft Windows 2.0 . It included a personal calendar , text editor ( with WordStar-like command interface ) , calculator , ASCII chart , address book , and phone dialer . According to the prospectus for Borland 's initial public offering of stock to the public , Sidekick sold more than 1 million copies in its first three years .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",

  "/wiki/Cross-platform": "In computing , cross-platform software ( also multi-platform software or platform-independent software ) is computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms . Cross-platform software may be divided into two types ; one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports , and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation , e.g. , software written in an interpreted language or pre-compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or standard components of all platforms . For example , a cross-platform application may run on Microsoft Windows , Linux , and macOS . Cross-platform programs may run on as many as all existing platforms , or on as few as two platforms . Cross-platform frameworks ( such as Qt , Flutter , NativeScript , Xamarin , Phonegap , Ionic , and React Native ) exist to aid cross-platform development ."
