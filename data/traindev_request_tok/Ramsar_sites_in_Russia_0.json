Siberia has been part of modern Russia since the 17th century . The territory of Siberia extends eastwards from the Ural Mountains to the watershed between the Pacific and Arctic drainage basins . The Yenisei River conditionally divides Siberia into two parts , Western and Eastern . Siberia stretches southwards from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central Kazakhstan and to the national borders of Mongolia and China . With an area of 13.1 million square kilometres ( 5,100,000 sq mi ) , Siberia accounts for 77% of Russia 's land area , but it is home to approximately 33 million people - 23% of the country 's population . This is equivalent to an average population density of about 3 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 7.8/sq mi ) ( approximately equal to that of Australia ) , making Siberia one of the most sparsely populated regions on Earth . If it were a country by itself , it would still be the largest country in area , but in population it would be the world 's 35th-largest and Asia 's 14th-largest . Worldwide , Siberia is well-known primarily for its long , harsh winters , with a January average of \u221225 \u00b0C ( \u221213 \u00b0F ) , as well as its extensive history of use by Russian and Soviet governments as a place for prisons , labor camps , and internal exile .",
  "/wiki/Coregonus": "Coregonus is a diverse genus of fish in the salmon family ( Salmonidae ) . The Coregonus species are known as whitefishes . The genus contains at least 68 described extant taxa , but the true number of species is a matter of debate . The type species of the genus is Coregonus lavaretus . Most Coregonus species inhabit lakes and rivers , and several species , including the Arctic cisco ( C. autumnalis ) , the Bering cisco ( C. laurettae ) , and the least cisco ( C. sardinella ) are anadromous , moving between salt water and fresh water . The genus was previously subdivided into two subgenera Coregonus ( true whitefishes ) and Leucichthys ( ciscoes ) , Coregonus comprising taxa with sub-terminal mouth and usually a benthic feeding habit , Leucichthys those with terminal or supra-terminal mouth and usually a pelagic plankton-feeding habit . This classification is not natural however : based on molecular data , ciscoes comprise two distinct lineages within the genus . Moreover , the genus Stenodus is not phylogenetically distinct from Coregonus . Many whitefish species or ecotypes , especially from the Great Lakes and the Alpine lakes of Europe , have gone extinct over the past century or are endangered . Among 12 freshwater fish considered extinct in Europe , 6 are Coregonus . All Coregonus species are protected under appendix III of the Bern Convention .",

This agile bird , which is capable of both flight and diving , has a predominantly aquatic lifestyle and only comes to land in order to breed . It is monogamous , choosing one partner for life . Females lay one egg per year . Razorbills nest along coastal cliffs in enclosed or slightly exposed crevices . The parents spend equal amounts of time incubating , and once the chick has hatched , they take turns foraging for their young .

The city of Murmansk is the most populous human settlement on the peninsula , with a population of over 300,000 as of the 2010 Census . While the north of the peninsula was already settled in the 7th-5th millennium BCE , the rest of its territory remained uninhabited until the 3rd millennium BCE , when various peoples started to arrive from the south . However , by the 1st millennium CE only the Sami people remained . This changed in the 12th century , when Russian Pomors discovered the peninsula 's game and fish riches . Soon after , the Pomors were followed by the tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic , and the peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands . No permanent settlements , however , were established by the Novgorodians until the 15th century . The Soviet period saw a rapid increase of the population , although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads . The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization , including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements , and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized , largely due to its strategic position and the discovery of the vast apatite deposits in the 1920s . As a result , the ecology of the peninsula suffered major ecological damage , including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting . After the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the economy went into decline and the population quickly started to decrease .",

  "/wiki/Merginae": "The seaducks ( Mergini ) are a tribe of the duck subfamily of birds , the Anatinae . The taxonomy of this group is incomplete . Some authorities separate the group as a subfamily , others remove some genera from the group and keep others . Most species within the group spend their winters near coastal waters . Many species have developed specialized salt glands to allow them to tolerate salt water but these are poorly developed in juveniles . Some of the species prefer riverine habitats . All but two of the 20 species in this group live in far northern latitudes . The fish-eating members of this group , such as the mergansers and smew , have serrated edges to their bills to help them grip their prey and are often known as sawbills . Other seaducks forage by diving underwater , taking molluscs or crustaceans from the sea floor . The Mergini take on the eclipse plumage during the late summer and molt into their breeding plumage during the winter .",

Water in a liman is brackish with a variable salinity : during periods of low fresh-water intake , it may become significantly more saline as a result of evaporation and inflow of sea water . Such features are found in places with low tidal range , for example along the western and northern coast of the Black Sea , in the Baltic Sea ( Vistula Lagoon , the Curonian Lagoon ) , as well as along the lowest part of the Danube .

The sea is largely affected by the inflow of numerous rivers , which bring sand , silt , and shells , which in turn form numerous bays , limans , and narrow spits . Because of these deposits , the sea bottom is relatively smooth and flat with the depth gradually increasing toward the middle . Also , due to the river inflow , water in the sea has low salinity and a high amount of biomass ( such as green algae ) that affects the water colour . Abundant plankton result in unusually high fish productivity . The sea shores and spits are low ; they are rich in vegetation and bird colonies .",

  "/wiki/Mire": "A mire , peatland or quagmire is a wetland type , dominated by living peat-forming plants . Mires arise because of incomplete decomposition of organic matter , usually litter from vegetation , due to water-logging and subsequent anoxia . All types of mires share the common characteristic of being saturated with water at least seasonally with actively forming peat , while having its own set of vegetation and organisms . Like coral reefs , mires are unusual landforms in that they derive mostly from biological rather than physical processes , and can take on characteristic shapes and surface patterning . A quagmire is a floating ( quaking ) mire , bog or any peatland being in a stage of hydrosere or hydrarch ( hydroseral ) succession , resulting in pond-filling yields underfoot . Ombrotrophic types of quagmire may be called quaking bog ( quivering bog ) . Minerotrophic types can be named with the term quagfen . There are four types of mire : bog , fen , marsh and swamp . A bog is a mire that due to its location relative to the surrounding landscape obtains most of its water from rainfall ( ombrotrophic ) , while a fen is located on a slope , flat , or depression and gets most of its water from soil- or groundwater ( minerotrophic ) . Thus while a bog is always acidic and nutrient-poor , a fen may be slightly acidic , neutral , or alkaline , and either nutrient-poor or nutrient-rich . Although marshes are wetlands within which vegetation is rooted in mineral soil , some marshes form shallow peat deposits : these should be considered mires . Swamps are characterised by their forest canopy and , like fens , are typically of higher pH and nutrient availability than bogs .",

A large bird , it measures between 74 and 91 centimetres ( 29 and 36 in ) in length , with an average weight of 3.3 kilograms ( 7.3 lb ) . Its distribution is widespread , with birds from the north of its range in Europe and Asia migrating southwards to spend the winter in warmer places . It is the type species of the genus Anser and is the ancestor of the domestic goose , having been domesticated at least as early as 1360 BC . The genus name is from anser , the Latin for goose . Greylag geese travel to their northerly breeding grounds in spring , nesting on moorlands , in marshes , around lakes and on coastal islands . They normally mate for life and nest on the ground among vegetation . A clutch of three to five eggs is laid ; the female incubates the eggs and both parents defend and rear the young . The birds stay together as a family group , migrating southwards in autumn as part of a flock , and separating the following year . During the winter they occupy semi-aquatic habitats , estuaries , marshes and flooded fields , feeding on grass and often consuming agricultural crops . Some populations , such as those in Southern England and in urban areas across the species ' range , are primarily resident and occupy the same area year-round .",

  "/wiki/Osprey": "The osprey or more specifically the western osprey ( Pandion haliaetus ) - also called sea hawk , river hawk , and fish hawk - is a diurnal , fish-eating bird of prey with a cosmopolitan range . It is a large raptor , reaching more than 60 cm ( 24 in ) in length and 180 cm ( 71 in ) across the wings . It is brown on the upperparts and predominantly greyish on the head and underparts . The osprey tolerates a wide variety of habitats , nesting in any location near a body of water providing an adequate food supply . It is found on all continents except Antarctica , although in South America it occurs only as a non-breeding migrant . As its other common names suggest , the osprey 's diet consists almost exclusively of fish . It possesses specialised physical characteristics and exhibits unique behaviour to assist in hunting and catching prey . As a result of these unique characteristics , it has been given its own taxonomic genus , Pandion and family , Pandionidae . Three subspecies are usually recognized ; one of the former subspecies , cristatus , has recently been given full species status and is referred to as the eastern osprey .",
  "/wiki/Golden_eagle": "The golden eagle ( Aquila chrysaetos ) is one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere . It is the most widely distributed species of eagle . Like all eagles , it belongs to the family Accipitridae . These birds are dark brown , with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes . Immature eagles of this species typically have white on the tail and often have white markings on the wings . Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive , sharp talons to snatch up a variety of prey , mainly hares , rabbits , and marmots and other ground squirrels . Golden eagles maintain home ranges or territories that may be as large as 200 km2 ( 77 sq mi ) . They build large nests in cliffs and other high places to which they may return for several breeding years . Most breeding activities take place in the spring ; they are monogamous and may remain together for several years or possibly for life . Females lay up to four eggs , and then incubate them for six weeks . Typically , one or two young survive to fledge in about three months . These juvenile golden eagles usually attain full independence in the fall , after which they wander widely until establishing a territory for themselves in four to five years .",
  "/wiki/White_stork": "The white stork ( Ciconia ciconia ) is a large bird in the stork family Ciconiidae . Its plumage is mainly white , with black on its wings . Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks , and measure on average 100-115 cm ( 39-45 in ) from beak tip to end of tail , with a 155-215 cm ( 61-85 in ) wingspan . The two subspecies , which differ slightly in size , breed in Europe ( north to Finland ) , northwestern Africa , southwestern Asia ( east to southern Kazakhstan ) and southern Africa . The white stork is a long-distance migrant , wintering in Africa from tropical Sub-Saharan Africa to as far south as South Africa , or on the Indian subcontinent . When migrating between Europe and Africa , it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west , because the air thermals on which it depends for soaring do not form over water . A carnivore , the white stork eats a wide range of animal prey , including insects , fish , amphibians , reptiles , small mammals and small birds . It takes most of its food from the ground , among low vegetation , and from shallow water . It is a monogamous breeder , but does not pair for life . Both members of the pair build a large stick nest , which may be used for several years . Each year the female can lay one clutch of usually four eggs , which hatch asynchronously 33-34 days after being laid . Both parents take turns incubating the eggs and both feed the young .",
  "/wiki/Black_stork": "The black stork ( Ciconia nigra ) is a large bird in the stork family Ciconiidae . It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae . Measuring on average 95 to 100 cm ( 37 to 39 in ) from beak tip to end of tail with a 145-to-155 cm ( 57-to-61 in ) wingspan , the adult black stork has mainly black plumage , with white underparts , long red legs and a long pointed red beak . A widespread but uncommon species , it breeds in scattered locations across Europe ( predominantly in Spain , and central and eastern parts ) , and Asia to the Pacific Ocean . It is a long-distance migrant , with European populations wintering in tropical Sub-Saharan Africa , and Asian populations in the Indian subcontinent . When migrating between Europe and Africa , it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west . An isolated , non-migratory , population occurs in Southern Africa . Unlike the closely related white stork , the black stork is a shy and wary species . It is seen singly or in pairs , usually in marshy areas , rivers or inland waters . It feeds on amphibians , small fish and insects , generally wading slowly in shallow water stalking its prey . Breeding pairs usually build nests in large forest trees - most commonly deciduous but also coniferous - which can be seen from long distances , as well as on large boulders , or under overhanging ledges in mountainous areas . The female lays two to five greyish-white eggs , which become soiled over time in the nest .",
  "/wiki/Black-throated_loon": "The black-throated loon ( Gavia arctica ) , also known as the Arctic loon and the black-throated diver , is a migratory aquatic bird found in the northern hemisphere , primarily breeding in freshwater lakes in northern Europe and Asia . It winters along sheltered , ice-free coasts of the north-east Atlantic Ocean and the eastern and western Pacific Ocean . This loon was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 . It has two subspecies . It was previously considered to be the same species as the Pacific loon , of which it is traditionally considered to be a sister species , although this is debated . In a study that used mitochondrial and nuclear intron DNA , the black-throated loon was found to be sister to a clade consisting of the Pacific loon and two sister species , the common loon and the yellow-billed loon . The black-throated loon measures about 70 cm ( 28 in ) in length and can weigh anywhere from 1.3 to 3.4 kilograms ( 2.9 to 7.5 lb ) . In breeding plumage , the adult of the nominate subspecies has mostly black upperparts , with the exception of some of the mantle and scapulars , which have white squares . The head and hindneck are grey , and the sides white and striped black . Most of the throat is also black , giving this bird the name black-throated loon . The colour of the throat patch can be used to distinguish the two subspecies ; the throat patch of the other subspecies , G. a. viridigularis , is green . The underparts are mostly white , including the bottom of the throat .",
  "/wiki/Eurasian_curlew": "The Eurasian curlew or common curlew ( Numenius arquata ) is a wader in the large family Scolopacidae . It is one of the most widespread of the curlews , breeding across temperate Europe and Asia . In Europe , this species is often referred to just as the curlew , and in Scotland known as the whaup in Scots . This is the largest wader in its range , at 50-60 cm ( 20-24 in ) in length , with an 89-106 cm ( 35-42 in ) wingspan and a body weight of 410-1,360 g ( 0.90-3.00 lb ) . It is mainly greyish brown , with a white back , greyish-blue legs and a very long curved bill . Males and females look identical , but the bill is longest in the adult female . It is generally not possible to recognize the sex of a single Eurasian curlew , or even several ones , as there is much variation ; telling male and female of a mated pair apart is usually possible however . The familiar call is a loud curloo-oo . The only similar species over most of the curlew 's range is the Eurasian whimbrel ( N. phaeopus ) . The whimbrel is smaller and has a shorter bill with a kink rather than a smooth curve . Flying curlews may also resemble bar-tailed godwits ( Limosa lapponica ) in their winter plumages ; however , the latter have a smaller body , a slightly upturned beak , and legs that do not reach far beyond their tail tips . The Eurasian curlew 's feet are longer , forming a conspicuous point .",
  "/wiki/Eurasian_eagle-owl": "The Eurasian eagle-owl ( Bubo bubo ) is a species of eagle-owl that resides in much of Eurasia . It is also called the European eagle-owl and in Europe , it is occasionally abbreviated to just eagle-owl . It is one of the largest species of owl , and females can grow to a total length of 75 cm ( 30 in ) , with a wingspan of 188 cm ( 6 ft 2 in ) , males being slightly smaller . This bird has distinctive ear tufts , with upper parts that are mottled with darker blackish colouring and tawny . The wings and tail are barred . The underparts are a variably hued buff , streaked with darker colour . The facial disc is not very visible and the orange eyes are distinctive . The Eurasian eagle-owl is one of the largest living species of owl as well as one of the most widely distributed . The Eurasian eagle-owl is found in many habitats but is mostly a bird of mountain regions , coniferous forests , steppes and other relatively remote places . It is a mostly nocturnal predator , hunting for a range of different prey species , predominantly small mammals but also birds of varying sizes , reptiles , amphibians , fish , large insects and other assorted invertebrates . It typically breeds on cliff ledges , in gullies , among rocks or in other concealed locations . The nest is a scrape in which averages of two eggs are laid at intervals .",
  "/wiki/Eurasian_bittern": "The Eurasian bittern or great bittern ( Botaurus stellaris ) is a wading bird in the bittern subfamily ( Botaurinae ) of the heron family Ardeidae . There are two subspecies , the northern race ( B. s. stellaris ) breeding in parts of Europe and Asia , as well as on the northern coast of Africa , while the southern race ( B. s. capensis ) is endemic to parts of southern Africa . It is a secretive bird , seldom seen in the open as it prefers to skulk in reed beds and thick vegetation near water bodies . Its presence is apparent in the spring , when the booming call of the male during the breeding season can be heard . It feeds on fish , small mammals , fledgling birds , amphibians , crustaceans and insects . The nest is usually built among reeds at the edge of bodies of water . The female incubates the clutch of eggs and feeds the young chicks , which leave the nest when about two weeks old . She continues to care for them until they are fully fledged some six weeks later . With its specific habitat requirements and the general reduction in wetlands across its range , the population is thought to be in decline globally . However the decline is slow , and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its overall conservation status as being of least concern . Nevertheless , some local populations are at risk and the population of the southern race has declined more dramatically and is cause for concern . In the United Kingdom it is one of the most threatened of all bird species ."
