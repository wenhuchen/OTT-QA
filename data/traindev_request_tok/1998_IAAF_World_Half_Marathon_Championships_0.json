At 580,367 square kilometres ( 224,081 sq mi ) , Kenya is the world 's 48th largest country by total area . With a population of more than 47.6 million people , Kenya is the 29th most populous country . Kenya 's capital and largest city is Nairobi , while its oldest city and first capital is the coastal city of Mombasa . Kisumu City is the third largest city and also an inland port on Lake Victoria . Other important urban centres include Nakuru and Eldoret . Kenya is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest , Ethiopia to the north , Somalia to the east , Uganda to the west , Tanzania to the south , and the Indian Ocean to the southeast . According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material , the Cushites first settled in the lowlands of Kenya between 3,200 and 1,300 BC , a phase referred to as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic . Nilotic-speaking pastoralists ( ancestral to Kenya 's Nilotic speakers ) started migrating from present-day southern Sudan into Kenya around 500 BC . European colonisation of Kenya began in the 19th century during the European exploration of the interior . Modern-day Kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the British Empire in 1895 and the subsequent Kenya Colony , which began in 1920 . Numerous disputes between the UK and the colony led to the Mau Mau revolution , which began in 1952 , and the subsequent declaration of independence in 1963 .",

It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres ( 1,739 mi ) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans ; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia , Botswana , and Zimbabwe ; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini ( Swaziland ) ; and it surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho . South Africa is the largest country in Southern Africa and the 24th-largest country in the world by land area and , with over 58 million people , is also the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",

Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD , the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties , reaching its zenith under Almoravid and Almohad rule , when it spanned parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa . The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier .

Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa , which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the Nubian and Somali tectonic plates . Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia . It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era . Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BCE , Ethiopia 's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history . Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba , under its first king , Menelik I . In the first centuries , the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region , followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137 . During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa , Ethiopia and Liberia were two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power and many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours . However , the country was later occupied by Italy in 1936 and became Italian Ethiopia ( part of Italian East Africa ) until it was liberated during World War II .",

Zimbabwe then joined the Commonwealth of Nations , from which it was suspended in 2002 for breaches of international law by its then-government , and from which it withdrew in December 2003 .

Serbian : \u0421\u0426\u0413 , romanized : SCG ) , also known from 2003 to 2006 as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro ( Serbian : \u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0438 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 , romanized : Dr\u017eavna Zajednica Srbija i Crna Gora ) , and known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1992 to 2003 , was a country in Southeast Europe , created from the two remaining federal republics of the Socialist Yugoslavia after its breakup in 1992 . The republics of Serbia and Montenegro together established a federation in 1992 as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( abbr . FR Yugoslavia or FRY ; Serbian : \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430 , romanized : Savezna Republika Jugoslavija ) [ a ] or Yugoslavia ( Serbian : \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430 , romanized : Jugoslavija ) for short . For the first several years of its existence , the state aspired to be recognized as the sole legal successor to Yugoslavia , but those claims were opposed by other former constituent republics . The United Nations also denied its request to take up Yugoslavia 's membership . Eventually , after the overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 from power as president of the federation in 2000 , the country rescinded those aspirations and accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession . It re-applied for UN membership on 27 October 2000 and was admitted on 1 November . The FRY was initially dominated by Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 as President of Serbia ( 1989-1997 ) and then President of Yugoslavia ( 1997-2000 ) . Milo\u0161evi\u0107 installed and forced the removal of several federal presidents ( such as Dobrica \u0106osi\u0107 ) and prime ministers ( such as Milan Pani\u0107 ) . However , the Montenegrin government , initially enthusiastic supporters of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 , started gradually distancing themselves from his policies . That culminated in regime change in 1996 , when his former ally Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 reversed his policies , became leader of Montenegro 's ruling party and subsequently dismissed former Montenegrin leader Momir Bulatovi\u0107 , who remained loyal to the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government ."
