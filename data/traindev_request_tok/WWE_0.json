Knoxville is the principal city of the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area , which was 868,546 in 2015 . First settled in 1786 , Knoxville was the first capital of Tennessee . The city struggled with geographic isolation throughout the early 19th century . The arrival of the railroad in 1855 led to an economic boom . During the Civil War , the city was bitterly divided over the secession issue , and was occupied alternately by both Confederate and Union armies . Following the war , Knoxville grew rapidly as a major wholesaling and manufacturing center . The city 's economy stagnated after the 1920s as the manufacturing sector collapsed , the downtown area declined and city leaders became entrenched in highly partisan political fights . Hosting the 1982 World 's Fair helped reinvigorate the city , and revitalization initiatives by city leaders and private developers have had major successes in spurring growth in the city , especially the downtown area . Knoxville is the home of the flagship campus of the University of Tennessee , whose sports teams , the Tennessee Volunteers , are popular in the surrounding area . Knoxville is also home to the headquarters of the Tennessee Valley Authority , the Tennessee Supreme Court 's courthouse for East Tennessee , and the corporate headquarters of several national and regional companies .",

It is bordered on the north and east by the state of New York ; on the east , southeast , and south by the Atlantic Ocean ; on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania ; and on the southwest by the Delaware Bay and the State of Delaware . New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark . New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",
