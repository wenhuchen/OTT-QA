It was held on 23 February 1974 and presented by Jimmy Savile as part of the BBC1 TV series Clunk , Click . As It Happens , with Olivia Newton-John selected to perform all of the entries , in part due to the recommendation of her close friend Cliff Richard . Originally , as with 1973 , Cilla Black 's 1974 nine-part BBC series was scheduled to feature the 'Song for Europe ' process , but Black was uncomfortable at promoting another female singer ( Newton-John ) each week throughout the series ' run and in a rather last minute decision , the BBC arranged to move the process to another show . This necessitated a truncating of the regularly established format of the chosen artist performing one song a week on the given series , so it was planned that Newton-John would perform two songs a week for three weeks once the series started . However , a BBC strike led to the cancellation of the first show , so another revision was needed and Olivia performed three songs a show over two programmes . In the final , her performances were immediately repeated before viewers were asked to cast votes via postcards through the mail to choose the winner . An extremely low postal vote led to Long Live Love winning with just 27,387 votes . The top two songs from the contest were released on single , reaching No . 11 in the UK Singles Chart , the first UK entry since 1966 not to reach the top ten , or indeed , the top four . Newton-John had just signed a new recording contract with EMI internationally , who released the single in most territories , but it was released on Pye International in the UK as the final commitment of her previously existing contract . All six songs were included on her debut EMI album Long Live Love released later in 1974 , although these tracks were dropped from the US release .",

The Shadows were selected by the BBC to represent the UK , after BBC executive Bill Cotton had stated that he specifically wanted a group to sing for Britain in 1975 . His choice was met with a negative response by the UK media , the song writing community and the general public . Members of the group were responsible for two of the six shortlisted songs , causing a further outcry from the music publishers associations . The Shadows performed one song a week for six weeks on the BBC1 TV series Lulu , hosted by 1969 Eurovision joint winner Lulu . Uniquely , although the group were seen performing weekly , in fact they only recorded one performance of each of the six songs in December 1974 , for a special edition of the series broadcast on 15 February 1975 . These performances were then shown individually for the six week period , before being shown back-to-back in the final , followed by an immediate repeat of all six . Viewers cast votes via postcard for their favourite song and the winning entry announced on 22 February was Let Me Be The One which received 17,477 votes , the lowest published figure known for a winning song in the UK finals that used either voting by mail or telephone . The choice of The Shadows led to calls from the Music Publishers Association for the songwriters and composers to be allowed to select the artist of their choice to perform the songs in future UK selections for Eurovision and the low postal vote persuaded the BBC that a new format was indeed needed . This was inaugurated in 1976 . The winning song was written by Paul Curtis , who won the Song for Europe contest another three times , making him the most successful writer in the history of the UK selection process . He also wrote a further 21 songs that reached the UK finals .",
