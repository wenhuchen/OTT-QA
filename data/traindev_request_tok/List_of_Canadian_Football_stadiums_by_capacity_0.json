It is also called The Big Owe to reference the astronomical cost of the stadium and the 1976 Olympics as a whole . The stadium is the largest by seating capacity in Canada . After the Olympics , artificial turf was installed and it became the home of Montreal 's professional baseball and football teams . The Montreal Alouettes of the CFL returned to their previous home of Molson Stadium in 1998 for regular season games , but continued to use Olympic Stadium for playoff and Grey Cup games until 2014 when they returned to Molson Stadium for all of their games .

The stadium currently serves as a multipurpose facility for special events ( e.g . concerts , trade shows ) with a permanent seating capacity of 56,040 . The capacity is expandable with temporary seating . The Montreal Impact of Major League Soccer ( MLS ) use the venue on occasion , when demand for tickets justifies the large capacity or when the weather restricts outdoor play at nearby Saputo Stadium in the spring months .

In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion .

Unlike most other professional teams in the four most popular North American team sports ( but much more common in soccer , especially in Europe ) the official legal name Winnipeg Football Club continues to see significant everyday use alongside its nickname , particularly in local media and especially when reporting on the club 's business affairs . Another unique aspect to the club compared to other North American professional sports teams ( but also more common in Europe ) is that it is organized as a corporation without share capital , meaning no one person or entity owns the team - while there are two other community-owned non-profit professional football teams in the CFL and one in the NFL , unlike the Winnipeg Football Club they all have shareholders . Since their establishment , the Blue Bombers have won the league 's Grey Cup championship 11 times , most recently in 2019 when they defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-12 in the 107th Grey Cup . The team holds the record for most Grey Cup appearances of any team ( 25 ) and were the first club not located in Ontario or Quebec to win a championship .",

The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No . 159 . Regina was previously the seat of government of the North-West Territories , of which the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta originally formed part , and of the District of Assiniboia . The site was previously called Wascana ( Buffalo Bones in Cree ) , but was renamed to Regina ( Latin for Queen ) in 1882 in honour of Queen Victoria . This decision was made by Queen Victoria 's daughter Princess Louise , who was the wife of the Governor General of Canada , the Marquess of Lorne . Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West , on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off , Wascana Creek . Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 260-metre ( 850 ft ) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake . Regina 's importance was further secured when the new province of Saskatchewan designated the city its capital in 1906 .",

As of July 2016 the city has a population of 531,902 , and the metropolitan area had a population of 800,296 . It is the eleventh largest city and the seventh largest metropolitan area in Canada . The Algonquian people had originally named the area K\u00e9bec , an Algonquin [ note 1 ] word meaning where the river narrows , because the Saint Lawrence River narrows proximate to the promontory of Quebec and its Cape Diamant . Explorer Samuel de Champlain founded a French settlement here in 1608 , and adopted the Algonquin name . Quebec City is one of the oldest European cities in North America . The ramparts surrounding Old Quebec ( Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec ) are the only fortified city walls remaining in the Americas north of Mexico . This area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985 as the Historic District of Old Qu\u00e9bec . The city 's landmarks include the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac hotel that dominates the skyline and the Citadelle of Quebec , an intact fortress that forms the centrepiece of the ramparts surrounding the old city and includes a secondary royal residence . The National Assembly of Quebec ( provincial legislature ) , the Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec ( National Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec ) , and the Mus\u00e9e de la civilisation ( Museum of Civilization ) are found within or near Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec .",

  "/wiki/Croix-Bleue_Medavie_Stadium": "Croix-Bleue Medavie Stadium ( French : Stade Croix-Bleue Medavie ) , formerly Moncton Stadium ( French : Stade Moncton ) , is a track and field stadium on the campus of the Universit\u00e9 de Moncton in Moncton , New Brunswick , Canada , built to host the IAAF 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics . The $ 17 million venue opened in 2010 . Although seating capacity had fluctuated early in construction ( original plans called for as many as 28,000 seats ) , the stadium has 10,000 permanent seats , and is expandable to 20,725 via temporary seating . The facility has also been proposed as a potential venue for a future Canadian Football League ( CFL ) expansion team , but a significant expansion to 25,000 seats would be recommended . CFL Commissioner Mark Cohon said he wanted to see neutral-site regular season games played in the new Moncton Stadium by 2010 . On February 1 , 2010 , it was announced that the Toronto Argonauts would play host to the Edmonton Eskimos in an event dubbed Touchdown Atlantic that took place on September 26 , 2010 . On September 22 , 2010 , Atlantic University Sport and Canadian Interuniversity Sport announced the Uteck Bowl will take place at the Moncton Stadium in 2011 , 2013 , and 2015 . On February 18 , 2011 , it was announced that the Hamilton Tiger-Cats would play host to the Calgary Stampeders in an event dubbed Touchdown Atlantic 2 that took place on September 25 , 2011 . As every CFL stadium had an artificial surface until 2016 ( the Argonauts began playing on natural grass at BMO Field in that year ) , the Touchdown Atlantic game had been the only CFL game played all season on a grass surface , although a temporary strip of artificial turf must be laid over the track in order to accommodate the end zones . The stadium also plays host to university soccer games .",
  "/wiki/Touchdown_Atlantic": "Touchdown Atlantic ( French : Touch\u00e9 Atlantique ) is a series of neutral site Canadian Football League games played in the maritime provinces of Canada . In 2003 , the league had struck a committee to examine the feasibility of adding a tenth team , with the leading candidate cities being Quebec City and Halifax . Before the suspension of the Renegades , league commissioner Tom Wright had indicated that Halifax was the leading candidate for expansion . With the success of Touchdown Atlantic 2010 , Moncton has moved into position of front runner for CFL expansion . No Touchdown Atlantic was played from 2014 to 2018 , but it returned in 2019 and 2020 due to the renewed interest in an Atlantic expansion team .",
  "/wiki/Moncton": "Moncton ( /\u02c8m\u028c\u014bkt\u0259n/ ; French pronunciation : \u200b [ m\u0254\u014bkt\u0153n ] ) is one of three major urban centres in the Canadian province of New Brunswick , along with Saint John and the capital city of Fredericton . Situated in the Petitcodiac River Valley , Moncton lies at the geographic centre of the Maritime Provinces . The city has earned the nickname Hub City due to its central inland location in the region and its history as a railway and land transportation hub for the Maritimes . The city proper has a population of 71,889 ( 2016 ) and a land area of 142 km2 ( 55 sq mi ) . Greater Moncton has a population of 144,810 ( 2016 ) , making it the largest city and census metropolitan area ( CMA ) in New Brunswick , and the second-largest city and CMA in the Maritime Provinces . The CMA includes the neighbouring city of Dieppe and the town of Riverview , as well as adjacent suburban areas in Westmorland and Albert counties . Although the Moncton area was first settled in 1733 , Moncton was officially founded in 1766 with the arrival of Pennsylvania Dutch immigrants from Philadelphia . Initially an agricultural settlement , Moncton was not incorporated until 1855 . The city was named for Lt. Col. Robert Monckton , the British officer who had captured nearby Fort Beaus\u00e9jour a century earlier . A significant wooden shipbuilding industry had developed in the community by the mid-1840s , allowing for the civic incorporation in 1855 . However , the shipbuilding economy collapsed in the 1860s , causing the town to lose its civic charter in 1862 . Moncton regained its charter in 1875 after the community 's economy rebounded , mainly due to a growing railway industry .",
  "/wiki/New_Brunswick": "New Brunswick is one of four Atlantic provinces on the east coast of Canada . According to the Constitution of Canada , New Brunswick is the only bilingual province . About two-thirds of the population declare themselves anglophones , and one third francophones . One-third of the population describes themselves as bilingual . Atypically for Canada , only about half of the population lives in urban areas , mostly in Greater Moncton , Greater Saint John and the capital Fredericton . Unlike the other Maritime provinces , New Brunswick 's terrain is mostly forested uplands , with much of the land further from the coast , giving it a harsher climate . New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely-populated than the rest of the Maritimes . Being relatively close to Europe , New Brunswick was among the first places in North America to be explored and settled by Europeans , starting with the French in the early 1600s , who displaced the indigenous Mi'kmaq , Maliseet , and the Passamaquoddy peoples . The French settlers were later displaced when the area became part of the British Empire . In 1784 , after an influx of refugees from the American Revolutionary War , the province was partitioned from Nova Scotia . In 1785 Saint John became Canada 's first incorporated city . The province prospered in the early 1800s and the population grew rapidly , reaching about a quarter of a million by mid-century ."
