They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the National League ( NL ) East division . Their home park is Marlins Park . Though one of only two MLB franchises to have never won a division title ( the other being the Colorado Rockies ) , the Marlins have won two World Series championships as a wild card team . The team began play as an expansion team in the 1993 season as the Florida Marlins and played home games from their inaugural season to the 2012 season at what was originally called Joe Robbie Stadium , which they shared with the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League ( NFL ) . Since the 2012 season , they have played at Marlins Park in downtown Miami , on the site of the former Orange Bowl . The new park , unlike their previous home ( which was criticized in its baseball configuration for poor sight lines in some locations ) , was designed foremost as a baseball park . Per an agreement with the city and Miami-Dade County ( which owns the park ) , the Marlins officially changed their name to the Miami Marlins on November 11 , 2011 . They also adopted a new logo , color scheme , and uniforms . The Marlins have the distinction of winning a World Series championship in every postseason they have qualified for to date , having won the World Series in 1997 and 2003 as National League wild card team . They also have the distinction of being the only franchise in the major four North American professional sports leagues ( MLB , NBA , NFL , NHL ) to have never lost a playoff round . They defeated the American League ( AL ) champion Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series , with shortstop \u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda driving in second baseman Craig Counsell for the series-clinching run in the 11th inning of the seventh and deciding game .",
  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning .",

A total of 30 teams play in Major League Baseball : 15 teams in the National League ( NL ) and 15 in the American League ( AL ) . The NL and AL were formed as separate legal entities in 1876 and 1901 , respectively . Beginning in 1903 , the two leagues cooperated but remained legally separate entities . In 2000 the leagues merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball . MLB also oversees Minor League Baseball , which comprises 256 teams affiliated with the major league clubs . MLB and the World Baseball Softball Confederation jointly manage the international World Baseball Classic tournament . Baseball 's first openly all-professional team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings founded in 1869 . Before that , some teams had secretly paid some players . The first few decades of professional baseball were characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another . The period before 1920 is known as the dead-ball era , during which players would rarely hit home runs .",

With a seating capacity of 37,442 , it is the third-smallest stadium in Major League Baseball by official capacity , and the smallest by actual capacity . The stadium 's public-funding plan led to a protracted lawsuit , largely contributed to the ouster of several local politicians , and triggered an SEC investigation . As revelations of the team 's finances and their handling of payroll ( both before and after construction ) seemed to contradict some of the premises on which the tax-funded-stadium deal were based , the ballpark controversy intensified . Despite questionable financing decisions by members of local government at the time , the financing of the project did not use General Fund taxes from local taxpayers and pulled from tourist funds specifically allocated for public-benefiting projects like sports facilities . The facility hosted a second-round pool of the 2013 World Baseball Classic , a first-round pool of the 2017 World Baseball Classic , and hosted the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game .",

  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) .

  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",

  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_VII": "Super Bowl VII was an American football game between the American Football Conference ( AFC ) champion Miami Dolphins and the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion Washington Redskins to decide the National Football League ( NFL ) champion for the 1972 season . The Dolphins defeated the Redskins by the score of 14-7 , and became the first and still the only team in NFL history to complete a perfect undefeated season . They also remain the only Super Bowl champion to win despite having been shut out in the second half of the game . The game was played on January 14 , 1973 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles , the second time the Super Bowl was played in that city . At kickoff , the temperature was 84 \u00b0F ( 29 \u00b0C ) , making the game the warmest Super Bowl . This was the Dolphins ' second Super Bowl appearance ; they had lost Super Bowl VI to Dallas the previous year . The Dolphins posted an undefeated 14-0 regular season record before defeating the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs . The Redskins were making their first Super Bowl appearance after posting an 11-3 regular-season record and playoff victories over the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys . Despite being undefeated , the Dolphins were actually one-point underdogs , largely based on the weakness of their regular-season schedule . Super Bowl VII was largely dominated by the Dolphins , and is the second-lowest-scoring Super Bowl to date with a total of only 21 points ( three touchdowns and three extra points ) , second only to the 13-3 score of Super Bowl LIII . The only real drama occurred during the final minutes of the game , in what was later known as Garo 's Gaffe . Miami attempted to cap their 17-0 perfect season with a 17-0 shutout by means of a 42-yard field goal by Garo Yepremian , but instead the game and the season was jeopardized when his kick was blocked .",

Super Bowl VIII was largely dominated by the Dolphins , who scored 24 unanswered points during the first three quarters , including two touchdowns on their first two drives . Minnesota 's best chance to threaten Miami occurred with less than a minute left in the first half , but Vikings running back Oscar Reed fumbled the ball away at the Dolphins ' 6-yard line , and his team was unable to overcome Miami 's lead in the second half . The Dolphins ' Larry Csonka became the first running back to be named Super Bowl MVP ; both his 145 rushing yards and his 33 carries were Super Bowl records .",
