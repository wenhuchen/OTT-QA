He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema . Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936 , following a brief stint as a painter . After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter , he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata ( a.k.a . Judo Saga ) . After the war , the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel ( 1948 ) , in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role , cemented the director 's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan . The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films . Rashomon , which premiered in Tokyo , became the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival . The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry , which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers . Kurosawa directed approximately one film per year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s , including a number of highly regarded ( and often adapted ) films , such as Ikiru ( 1952 ) , Seven Samurai ( 1954 ) and Yojimbo ( 1961 ) .

Such disasters include natural disasters such as floods , earthquakes , tsunamis or asteroid collisions , accidents such as shipwrecks or airplane crashes , or calamities like worldwide disease pandemics . A subgenre of action films , these films usually feature some degree of build-up , the disaster itself , and sometimes the aftermath , usually from the point of view of specific individual characters or their families or portraying the survival tactics of different people . These films often feature large casts of actors and multiple plot lines , focusing on the characters ' attempts to avert , escape or cope with the disaster and its aftermath . The genre came to particular prominence during the 1970s with the release of high-profile films such as Airport ( 1970 ) , followed in quick succession by The Poseidon Adventure ( 1972 ) , Earthquake ( 1974 ) and The Towering Inferno ( 1974 ) . The casts were generally made up of familiar character actors . Once the disaster begins in the film , the characters are usually confronted with human weaknesses , often falling in love and almost always finding a villain to blame . The films usually feature a persevering hero or heroine ( Charlton Heston , Steve McQueen , etc . ) called upon to lead the struggle against the threat . In many cases , the evil or selfish individuals are the first to succumb to the conflagration .

  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio ."
