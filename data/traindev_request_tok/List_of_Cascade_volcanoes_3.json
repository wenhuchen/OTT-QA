  "/wiki/Medicine_Lake_Volcano": "Medicine Lake Volcano is a large shield volcano in northeastern California about 30 miles ( 50 km ) northeast of Mount Shasta . The volcano is located in a zone of east-west crustal extension east of the main axis of the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the Cascade Range . The 0.6-mile ( 1 km ) thick shield is 22 miles ( 35 km ) from east to west and 28 to 31 miles ( 45 to 50 km ) from north to south , and covers more than 770 square miles ( 2,000 km2 ) . The underlying rock has downwarped by 0.3 miles ( 0.5 km ) under the center of the volcano . The volcano is primarily composed of basalt and basaltic andesite lava flows , and has a 4.3-by-7.5-mile ( 7 by 12 km ) caldera at the center . The Medicine Lake shield rises about 3,900 feet ( 1,200 m ) above the Modoc Plateau to an elevation of 7,795 feet ( 2,376 m ) . Lavas from Medicine Lake Volcano are estimated to be at least 140 cubic miles ( 600 km3 ) in volume , making Medicine Lake the largest volcano by volume in the Cascade Range ( Newberry Volcano in Oregon has the second largest volume ) . Lava Beds National Monument lies on the northeast flank of the volcano . Medicine Lake Volcano has been active for 500,000 years . The eruptions were gentle rather than explosive like Mount St. Helens , coating the volcano 's sides with flow after flow of basaltic lava . Medicine Lake is part of the old caldera , a bowl-shaped depression in the mountain . It is believed that the Medicine Lake volcano is unique , having many small magma chambers rather than one large one .",
  "/wiki/Shield_volcano": "A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually composed almost entirely of fluid lava flows . It is named for its low profile , resembling a warrior 's shield lying on the ground . This is caused by the highly fluid ( low viscosity ) lava erupted , which travels farther than lava erupted from a stratovolcano , and results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava , building up the shield volcano 's distinctive form .",
  "/wiki/Rainbow_Mountain_(California)": "Rainbow Mountain is a stratovolcano at the southern end of the Cascade Range in Siskiyou County , California . It is located between Mount Shasta and the Medicine Lake Volcano , consisting of andesitic and dacitic rocks that were produced during the Early Pleistocene subepoch . Its last known eruption is also of Pleistocene age .",
  "/wiki/Stratovolcano": "A stratovolcano , also known as a composite volcano , is a conical volcano built up by many layers ( strata ) of hardened lava , tephra , pumice and ash . Unlike shield volcanoes , stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions , although some have collapsed summit craters called calderas . The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far , due to high viscosity . The magma forming this lava is often felsic , having high-to-intermediate levels of silica ( as in rhyolite , dacite , or andesite ) , with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma . Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon , but have travelled as far as 15 km ( 9.3 mi ) . Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called composite volcanoes because of their composite stratified structure built up from sequential outpourings of erupted materials . They are among the most common types of volcanoes , in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes . Two famous examples of stratovolcanoes are Krakatoa in Indonesia , known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883 , and Vesuvius in Italy , whose catastrophic eruption in AD 79 ruined the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum . Both eruptions claimed thousands of lives . In modern times , Mount Saint Helens and Mount Pinatubo have erupted catastrophically , with fewer deaths . The possible existence of stratovolcanoes on other terrestrial bodies of the Solar System has not been conclusively demonstrated . The one feasible exception is the existence of some isolated massifs on Mars , for example the Zephyria Tholus .",
  "/wiki/Mount_Shasta": "Mount Shasta ( Karuk : \u00daytaahkoo or White Mountain ) is a potentially active volcano at the southern end of the Cascade Range in Siskiyou County , California . At an elevation of 14,179 feet ( 4321.8 m ) , it is the second-highest peak in the Cascades and the fifth-highest in the state . Mount Shasta has an estimated volume of 85 cubic miles ( 350 km3 ) , which makes it the most voluminous stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc . The mountain and surrounding area are part of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest .",
  "/wiki/Shastina": "Shastina is the highest satellite cone of Mount Shasta , and one of four overlapping volcanic cones which together form the most voluminous stratovolcano in the Cascade Range . At 12,335 feet ( 3,760 m ) , Shastina is taller than Mount Adams and would rank as the third highest volcano in the Cascades behind Mount Rainier and Shasta were it not nestled on the western flank of its higher neighbor . Shastina has a topographic prominence of over 450 ft ( 137 m ) above the saddle connecting it with Shasta and easily exceeds the typical mountaineering standard of 300 feet ( 91 m ) for a peak to qualify as an independent summit , yet most lists of Cascade volcanoes omit it nonetheless . The name Shastina is a diminutive of Shasta . Shastina was formed during a VEI-4 eruption around 7650 BC that also involved activity at the summit of Mount Shasta and the Red Banks on Shasta 's south flank .",
  "/wiki/Black_Butte_(California)": "Black Butte is a cluster of overlapping dacite lava domes in a butte , a satellite cone of Mount Shasta . It is located directly adjacent to Interstate 5 at milepost 742 between the city of Mount Shasta and Weed , California . The highway crosses a 3,912 ft ( 1,192 m ) pass , Black Butte Summit , at the western base of the lava domes . The lava domes were extruded at the foot of the cone of Shastina following the period of its major eruptions about 9,000-10,000 years ago . A United States Forest Service fire lookout tower was built on the summit in the early 1930s , but destroyed during the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 . A new lookout was built in 1963 and operated until 1973 . The building was moved by helicopter to a new location in 1975 and only the concrete foundation remains today . A 2.5-mile-long ( 4.0 km ) trail leads to the summit from a trailhead accessible by gravel roads off the Everitt Memorial Highway . The summit boasts an outstanding view of the southwest side of Shasta and Shastina , and on clear days Mount McLoughlin is easily visible 70 miles ( 113 km ) to the north in Oregon .",
  "/wiki/Lava_dome": "In volcanology , a lava dome is a circular mound-shaped protrusion resulting from the slow extrusion of viscous lava from a volcano . Dome-building eruptions are common , particularly in convergent plate boundary settings . Around 6% of eruptions on earth are lava dome forming . The geochemistry of lava domes can vary from basalt ( e.g . Semeru , 1946 ) to rhyolite ( e.g . Chaiten , 2010 ) although the majority are of intermediate composition ( such as Santiaguito , dacite-andesite , present day ) The characteristic dome shape is attributed to high viscosity that prevents the lava from flowing very far . This high viscosity can be obtained in two ways : by high levels of silica in the magma , or by degassing of fluid magma . Since viscous basaltic and andesitic domes weather fast and easily break apart by further input of fluid lava , most of the preserved domes have high silica content and consist of rhyolite or dacite . Existence of lava domes has been suggested for some domed structures on the Moon , Venus , and Mars , e.g . the Martian surface in the western part of Arcadia Planitia and within Terra Sirenum .",
  "/wiki/Before_Present": "Before Present ( BP ) years is a time scale used mainly in archaeology , geology and other scientific disciplines to specify when events occurred in the past . Because the present time changes , standard practice is to use 1 January 1950 as the commencement date ( epoch ) of the age scale , [ a ] reflecting the origin of practical radiocarbon dating in the 1950s . The abbreviation BP has been interpreted retrospectively as Before Physics ; that refers to the time before nuclear weapons testing artificially altered the proportion of the carbon isotopes in the atmosphere , making dating after that time likely to be unreliable . In a convention that is not always observed , many sources restrict the use of BP dates to those produced with radiocarbon dating ; the alternative notation RCYBP is explicitly Radio Carbon Years Before Present .",
  "/wiki/Brushy_Butte": "Brushy Butte is a small , poorly studied , shield volcano located immediately east of Timbered Crater , south-southeast of the Medicine Lake Highlands in northern California , U.S. ( near where Siskiyou County , California is adjacent to Shasta County , California ) .",
  "/wiki/Big_Cave": "Big Cave is a small shield volcano located in northern California in the Cascade Volcanic Arc of the Pacific Northwest . With an elevation listed at either 4,130 feet ( 1,260 m ) or 4,131 feet ( 1,259 m ) , it is the product of subduction of several tectonic plates under the North American Plate , which continues at a rate of 4 centimetres ( 1.6 in ) each year . Big Cave has a basaltic composition , with a rough surface texture , and has been covered by lava flows . Located between Big Lake to the north and Bald Mountain to the south , it forms part of a belt of Late Quaternary volcanoes moving north from the Lassen Peak volcano . It last erupted either during the late Pleistocene or Holocene epoch ; its exact age is unknown . It does not possess any major subfeatures besides young pyroclastic cones on its northern flank and on its summit .",
  "/wiki/Twin_Buttes_(California)": "The Twin Buttes are a group of volcanic cinder cones located in the Cascade Mountain Range of Shasta County , California .",
  "/wiki/Cinder_cone": "A cinder cone is a steep conical hill of loose pyroclastic fragments , such as either volcanic clinkers , volcanic ash , or cinder that has been built around a volcanic vent . The pyroclastic fragments are formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single , typically cylindrical , vent . As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air , it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders , clinkers , or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is symmetrical ; with slopes between 30-40\u00b0 ; and a nearly circular ground plan . Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit .",
  "/wiki/Fissure_vent": "A fissure vent , also known as a volcanic fissure , eruption fissure or simply a fissure , is a linear volcanic vent through which lava erupts , usually without any explosive activity . The vent is often a few metres wide and may be many kilometres long . Fissure vents can cause large flood basalts which run first in lava channels and later in lava tubes . After some time the eruption builds up spatter cones and may concentrate on one or some of them . Small fissure vents may not be easily discernible from the air , but the crater rows ( see Laki ) or the canyons ( see Eldgj\u00e1 ) built up by some of them are . The dikes that feed fissures reach the surface from depths of a few kilometers and connect them to deeper magma reservoirs , often under volcanic centers . Fissures are usually found in or along rifts and rift zones , such as Iceland and the East African Rift . Fissure vents are often part of the structure of shield volcanoes .",
  "/wiki/Cinder_Cone_and_the_Fantastic_Lava_Beds": "Cinder Cone is a cinder cone volcano in Lassen Volcanic National Park within the United States . It is located about 10 miles ( 16 km ) northeast of Lassen Peak and provides an excellent view of Brokeoff Mountain , Lassen Peak , and Chaos Crags . The cone was built to a height of 750 feet ( 230 m ) above the surrounding area and spread ash over 30 square miles ( 78 km2 ) . Then , like many cinder cones , it was snuffed out when several basalt lava flows erupted from its base . These flows , called the Fantastic Lava Beds , spread northeast and southwest , and dammed creeks , first creating Snag Lake on the south and then Butte Lake to the north . Butte Lake is fed by water from Snag Lake seeping through the lava beds . Nobles Emigrant Trail goes around Snag Lake and follows the edge of the lava beds . Its age has been controversial since the 1870s , when many people thought it was only a few decades old . Later , the cone and associated lava flows were thought to have formed about 1700 or during a 300-year- long series of eruptions ending in 1851 . Recent studies by U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) scientists , working in cooperation with the National Park Service to better understand volcanic hazards in the Lassen area , have firmly established that Cinder Cone was formed during two eruptions that occurred in the 1650s .",
  "/wiki/Chaos_Crags": "Chaos Crags is the youngest group of lava domes in Lassen Volcanic National Park , California . They formed as six dacite domes 1,100-1,000 years ago , one dome collapsing during an explosive eruption about 70 years later . The eruptions at the Chaos Crags mark one of just three instances of Holocene activity within the Lassen volcanic center . The cluster of domes is located north of Lassen Peak and form part of the southernmost segment of the Cascade Range in Northern California . Each year , a lake forms at the base of the Crags , and typically dries by the end of the summer season . From the base of the crags and extending toward the northwest corner of the park is Chaos Jumbles , a rock avalanche that undermined Chaos Crags ' northwest slope 300 years ago . Riding on a cushion of compressed air ( see sturzstrom ) , the rock debris traveled at about 100 miles per hour ( 160 km/h ) , flattened the forest before it , and dammed Manzanita Creek , forming Manzanita Lake . In addition to the possibility of forming additional lava domes , future activity at the Chaos Crags could pose hazards from pumice , pyroclastic flows , or rockfalls . Geological study of the Chaos Crags , which continues today , began in the late 1920s , when Howel Williams wrote about its pyroclastic rock deposits , rockfall avalanches , and eruptions . The area is monitored for rockslide threats , which could threaten the local area . The Crags and the surrounding area 's lakes and forests support numerous plant and animal species . The area is not a popular destination for visitors , despite its accessibility .",

  "/wiki/Lassen_Peak": "Lassen Peak , commonly referred to as Mount Lassen , is the southernmost active volcano in the Cascade Range of the Western United States . Located in the Shasta Cascade region of Northern California , it is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc , which stretches from southwestern British Columbia to northern California . Lassen Peak reaches an elevation of 10,457 feet ( 3,187 m ) , standing above the northern Sacramento Valley . It supports many flora and fauna among its diverse habitats , which are subject to frequent snowfall and reach high elevations . A lava dome , Lassen Peak has a volume of 0.6 cubic miles ( 2.5 km3 ) making it the largest lava dome on Earth . The volcano arose from the destroyed northern flank of now-collapsed Brokeoff Volcano about 27,000 years ago , from a series of eruptions over the course of a few years . The mountain has been significantly eroded by glaciers over the last 25,000 years , and is now covered in talus deposits . On May 22 , 1915 , a powerful explosive eruption at Lassen Peak devastated nearby areas , and spread volcanic ash as far as 280 miles ( 450 km ) to the east . This explosion was the most powerful in a series of eruptions from 1914 through 1917 . Lassen Peak and Mount St. Helens were the only two volcanoes in the contiguous United States to erupt during the 20th century . Lassen Volcanic National Park , which encompasses an area of 106,372 acres ( 430.47 km2 ) , was created to preserve the areas affected by the eruption , for future observation and study , and to protect the nearby volcanic features . The park , along with the nearby Lassen National Forest and Lassen Peak , have become popular destinations for recreational activities , including climbing , hiking , backpacking , snowshoeing , kayaking , and backcountry skiing .",
  "/wiki/Mount_Tehama": "Brokeoff Volcano ( also called Mount Tehama ) is an eroded andesitic stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the Cascade Range in Northern California . Part of the Lassen volcanic area , its highest remaining remnant , Brokeoff Mountain , is itself the second highest peak in Lassen Volcanic National Park and connects to the park 's highest point , Lassen Peak . Located on the border of Tehama County and Shasta County , Brokeoff 's peak is the highest point in the former . The hikers that summit this mountain each year are treated to exceptional views of Lassen Peak , the Central Valley of California , and many of the park 's other features . On clear days , Mount Shasta can also be seen in the distance . Brokeoff Volcano was active from 590,000 to 387,000 years ago , during which period it erupted numerous flows with compositions ranging from basaltic andesite to dacite . At its peak , Brokeoff Volcano reached an estimated height of 3,350 meters ( 11,000 feet ) and had a basal circumference of approximately 12 kilometers . At approximately 313,000 years ago volcanism began shifting to the northeast of Brokeoff Volcano , with volcanism currently focused around the modern Lassen Peak . Following the end of volcanism at Brokeoff Volcano , cooling magma beneath the surface continued to drive hot , highly reactive hydrothermal fluids circulating near the central vent of the volcano . These hydrothermal fluids chemically weathered the volcanic rocks near the central vent , making them particularly susceptible to physical erosion . Glaciers and streams were able to rapidly erode the hydrothermally altered rocks near the central vent , creating the deep Mill Canyon and exposing deep into the core of the ancient volcano . Many of the lava flows along the flanks of Brokeoff Volcano were not as extensively chemically weathered , resulting in the flanks of much of the volcano being preserved ."
