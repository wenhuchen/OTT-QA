From 1978 to 1980 , the Oilers , led by Bum Phillips and in the midst of the Luv Ya Blue campaign , appeared in the 1978 and 1979 AFC Championship Games ( but lost both ) . The Oilers were a consistent playoff team from 1987 to 1993 , an era that included both of the Oilers ' only division titles ( 1991 and 1993 ) , as well as the dubious distinction of being on the losing end of the largest comeback in NFL history . For the rest of the Oilers ' time in Houston , however , they compiled losing seasons in almost every year outside the aforementioned high points . The Oilers ' main colors were Columbia blue and white , with scarlet trim , while their logo was a simple derrick . Oilers jerseys were always Columbia blue for home and white for away .",

After being dismissed as the Browns ' head coach by Art Modell ( who had purchased majority interest in the team in 1961 ) in January 1963 , Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus .

Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL , which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season , Brown agreed to join the AFL as its tenth and final franchise . The Bengals , like the other former AFL teams , were assigned to the AFC following the merger . Cincinnati was also selected because , like their neighbors the Reds , they could draw from several large neighboring cities ( Louisville and Lexington , Kentucky ; Columbus , Dayton , and Springfield , Ohio ) that are all no more than 110 miles ( 180 km ) away from downtown Cincinnati , along with Indianapolis , until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season .
