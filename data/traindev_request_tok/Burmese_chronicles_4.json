It was written soon after the annexation to salvage Arakanese history after most of Mrauk-U 's historical records were burned down by Konbaung forces in 1785 . Rakhine Sayadaw , a Buddhist monk , tried to piece together the portions that escaped the indiscriminate destruction , and completed it in 1788 . According to G.E . Harvey , a British colonial period historian , the chronicle may not be as reliable as it is a third-hand piece of work . The chronicle covers from c. 825 BCE from the reign of legendary King Kanyaza Gyi to the Konbaung annexation in 1785 . Like most Arakanese chronicles , this chronicle provides a short account of legendary kings , and starts a more detailed coverage with King Sanda Thuriya ( 146-198 ) . It also contains many homilies and wise counsels on good governance given to various kings by wise men and ministers . It provides the most detailed accounts , starting with King Pa-Gyi ( Min Bin ) to the last king of Arakan , Maha Thammada .",
