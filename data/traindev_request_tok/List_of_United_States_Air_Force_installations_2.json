East Thrace , the part of Turkey in Europe , is separated from Anatolia by the Sea of Marmara , the Bosporus and the Dardanelles ( collectively called the Turkish Straits ) . Istanbul , mostly located on the European side , is the largest city in the country while Ankara is the capital . Turkey is bordered by Greece and Bulgaria to its northwest , the Black Sea to its north , Georgia to its northeast , Armenia , the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to its east , Iraq and Syria to its southeast , the Mediterranean Sea to its south , and the Aegean Sea to its west . Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power .",

GSUs are owned by their parent organization and are typically quite small . Assignment to a GSU can be a mixed blessing . The distance from the parent organization means a more relaxed atmosphere . However , it also means that members assigned to the GSU have to travel to the parent base for most military services such as the Commissary , Base exchange , or Personnel Unit . RAF Feltwell , subordinate to the 48th FW of RAF Lakenheath , is an example of a GSU .",

An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia .

Although no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force , improved versions are being built for export customers . In 1993 , General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation , which in turn became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta . The Fighting Falcon 's key features include a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility , side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering , an ejection seat reclined 30 degrees from vertical to reduce the effect of g-forces on the pilot , and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system which helps to make it an agile aircraft . The F-16 has an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 locations for mounting weapons and other mission equipment . The F-16 's official name is Fighting Falcon , but Viper is commonly used by its pilots and crews , due to a perceived resemblance to a viper snake as well as the Colonial Viper starfighter on Battlestar Galactica which aired at the time the F-16 entered service .

The A-10 was designed for close air support ( CAS ) of friendly ground troops , attacking armored vehicles and tanks , and providing quick-action support against enemy ground forces . It entered service in 1976 and is the only production-built aircraft that has served in the USAF that was designed solely for CAS . Its secondary mission is to provide forward air controller - airborne support , by directing other aircraft in attacks on ground targets . Aircraft used primarily in this role are designated OA-10 . The A-10 was intended to improve on the performance of the A-1 Skyraider and its lesser firepower . The A-10 was designed around the 30 mm GAU-8 Avenger rotary cannon . Its airframe was designed for durability , with measures such as 1,200 pounds ( 540 kg ) of titanium armor to protect the cockpit and aircraft systems , enabling it to absorb a significant amount of damage and continue flying . Its short takeoff and landing capability permits operation from airstrips close to the front lines , and its simple design enables maintenance with minimal facilities . The A-10 served in the Gulf War ( Operation Desert Storm ) , the American led intervention against Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait , where the A-10 distinguished itself .

  "/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper": "The General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper ( sometimes called Predator B ) is an unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) capable of remotely controlled or autonomous flight operations developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems ( GA-ASI ) primarily for the United States Air Force ( USAF ) . The MQ-9 and other UAVs are referred to as Remotely Piloted Vehicles/Aircraft ( RPV/RPA ) by the USAF to indicate their human ground controllers . The MQ-9 is the first hunter-killer UAV designed for long-endurance , high-altitude surveillance . In 2006 , the then-Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force General T. Michael Moseley said : We 've moved from using UAVs primarily in intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance roles before Operation Iraqi Freedom , to a true hunter-killer role with the Reaper . The MQ-9 is a larger , heavier , and more capable aircraft than the earlier General Atomics MQ-1 Predator ; it can be controlled by the same ground systems used to control MQ-1s . The Reaper has a 950-shaft-horsepower ( 712 kW ) turboprop engine ( compared to the Predator 's 115 hp ( 86 kW ) piston engine ) . The greater power allows the Reaper to carry 15 times more ordnance payload and cruise at about three times the speed of the MQ-1 . The aircraft is monitored and controlled by aircrew in the Ground Control Station ( GCS ) , including weapons employment . In 2008 , the New York Air National Guard 174th Attack Wing began the transition from F-16 piloted fighters to MQ-9A Reapers , becoming the first fighter unit to convert entirely to unmanned combat aerial vehicle ( UCAV ) use . In March 2011 , the U.S. Air Force was training more pilots for advanced unmanned aerial vehicles than for any other single weapons system . The Reaper is also used by the United States Navy , the CIA , U.S. Customs and Border Protection , NASA , and the militaries of several other countries . The USAF operated 195 MQ-9 Reapers as of September 2016 , and plans to keep the MQ-9 in service into the 2030s .",
  "/wiki/Intelligence,_surveillance,_target_acquisition,_and_reconnaissance": "ISTAR stands for intelligence , surveillance , target acquisition , and reconnaissance . In its macroscopic sense , ISTAR is a practice that links several battlefield functions together to assist a combat force in employing its sensors and managing the information they gather . Information is collected on the battlefield through systematic observation by deployed soldiers and a variety of electronic sensors . Surveillance , target acquisition and reconnaissance are methods of obtaining this information . The information is then passed to intelligence personnel for analysis , and then to the commander and his staff for the formulation of battle plans . Intelligence is processed information that is relevant and contributes to an understanding of the ground , and of enemy dispositions and intents . ISTAR is the process of integrating the intelligence process with surveillance , target acquisition and reconnaissance tasks in order to improve a commander 's situational awareness and consequently their decision making . The inclusion of the I is important as it recognizes the importance of taking the information from all the sensors and processing it into useful knowledge . ISTAR can also refer to :",
