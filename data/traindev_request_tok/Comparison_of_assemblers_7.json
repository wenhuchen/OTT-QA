  "/wiki/Instruction_set": "An instruction set architecture ( ISA ) is an abstract model of a computer . It is also referred to as architecture or computer architecture . A realization of an ISA , such as a central processing unit ( CPU ) , is called an implementation . In general , an ISA defines the supported data types , the registers , the hardware support for managing main memory fundamental features ( such as the memory consistency , addressing modes , virtual memory ) , and the input/output model of a family of implementations of the ISA . An ISA specifies the behavior of machine code running on implementations of that ISA in a fashion that does not depend on the characteristics of that implementation , providing binary compatibility between implementations . This enables multiple implementations of an ISA that differ in performance , physical size , and monetary cost ( among other things ) , but that are capable of running the same machine code , so that a lower-performance , lower-cost machine can be replaced with a higher-cost , higher-performance machine without having to replace software . It also enables the evolution of the microarchitectures of the implementations of that ISA , so that a newer , higher-performance implementation of an ISA can run software that runs on previous generations of implementations . If an operating system maintains a standard and compatible application binary interface ( ABI ) for a particular ISA , machine code for that ISA and operating system will run on future implementations of that ISA and newer versions of that operating system . However , if an ISA supports running multiple operating systems , it does not guarantee that machine code for one operating system will run on another operating system , unless the first operating system supports running machine code built for the other operating system . An ISA can be extended by adding instructions or other capabilities , or adding support for larger addresses and data values ; an implementation of the extended ISA will still be able to execute machine code for versions of the ISA without those extensions . Machine code using those extensions will only run on implementations that support those extensions . The binary compatibility that they provide make ISAs one of the most fundamental abstractions in computing .",

It may be the hardware or the operating system ( OS ) , even a web browser and associated application programming interfaces , or other underlying software , as long as the program code is executed with it . Computing platforms have different abstraction levels , including a computer architecture , an OS , or runtime libraries . A computing platform is the stage on which computer programs can run . A platform can be seen both as a constraint on the software development process , in that different platforms provide different functionality and restrictions ; and as an assistant to the development process , in that they provide low-level functionality ready-made . For example , an OS may be a platform that abstracts the underlying differences in hardware and provides a generic command for saving files or accessing the network .",

The even-numbered models included an Enhanced Instruction Set feature ( EIS ) , which added decimal arithmetic and storage-to-storage operations to the original word-oriented architecture . In 1973 Honeywell introduced the 6180 , a 6000-series machine with addressing modifications to support the Multics operating system . In 1974 Honeywell released the 68/80 which added cache memory in each processor and support for a large ( 2-8 million word ) directly addressable memory . In 1975 the 6000-series systems were renamed as Level 66 , which were slightly faster ( to 1.2 MIPS ) and offered larger memories . In 1977 the line was again renamed 66/DPS , and in 1979 to DPS-8 , again with a small performance improvement to 1.7 MIPS . The Multics model was the DPS-8/M .

It is an example of a complex instruction set computer , and has separate memory spaces for program instructions and data . Intel 's original MCS-51 family was developed using N-type metal-oxide-semiconductor ( NMOS ) technology like its predecessor Intel MCS-48 , but later versions , identified by a letter C in their name ( e.g. , 80C51 ) used complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ( CMOS ) technology and consume less power than their NMOS predecessors . This made them more suitable for battery-powered devices . The family was continued in 1996 with the enhanced 8-bit MCS-151 and the 8/16/32-bit MCS-251 family of binary compatible microcontrollers . While Intel no longer manufactures the MCS-51 , MCS-151 and MCS-251 family , enhanced binary compatible derivatives made by numerous vendors remain popular today .

The MC6800 microprocessor was part of the M6800 Microcomputer System that also included serial and parallel interface ICs , RAM , ROM and other support chips . A significant design feature was that the M6800 family of ICs required only a single five-volt power supply at a time when most other microprocessors required three voltages . The M6800 Microcomputer System was announced in March 1974 and was in full production by the end of that year . The 6800 has a 16-bit address bus that can directly access 64 kB of memory and an 8-bit bi-directional data bus . It has 72 instructions with seven addressing modes for a total of 197 opcodes .

When it was introduced in 1975 , the 6502 was , by a considerable margin , the least expensive microprocessor on the market . It initially sold for less than one-sixth the cost of competing designs from larger companies , such as Motorola and Intel . Its introduction caused rapid decreases in pricing across the entire processor market . Along with the Zilog Z80 , it sparked a series of projects that resulted in the home computer revolution of the early 1980s . Popular home video game consoles and computers , such as the Atari 2600 , Atari 8-bit family , Apple II , Nintendo Entertainment System , Commodore 64 , Atari Lynx , BBC Micro and others , used the 6502 or variations of the basic design . Soon after the 6502 's introduction , MOS Technology was purchased outright by Commodore International , who continued to sell the microprocessor and licenses to other manufacturers . In the early days of the 6502 , it was second-sourced by Rockwell and Synertek , and later licensed to other companies .

The Z80 was conceived by Federico Faggin in late 1974 and developed by him and his 11 employees starting in early 1975 . The first working samples were delivered in March 1976 , and it was officially introduced on the market in July 1976 . With the revenue from the Z80 , the company built its own chip factories and grew to over a thousand employees over the following two years . The Zilog Z80 is a software-compatible extension and enhancement of the Intel 8080 and , like it , was mainly aimed at embedded systems . Although used in that role , the Z80 also became one of the most widely used CPUs in desktop computers and home computers from the 1970s to the mid-1980s . It was also common in military applications , musical equipment such as synthesizers , and coin operated arcade games of the late 1970s and early 1980s including Pac-Man . Zilog licensed the Z80 to the US-based Synertek and Mostek , which had helped them with initial production , as well as to a European second source manufacturer , SGS . The design was also copied by several Japanese , East European and Soviet manufacturers . [ i ] This won the Z80 acceptance in the world market since large companies like NEC , Toshiba , Sharp , and Hitachi started to manufacture the device ( or their own Z80-compatible clones or designs ) . In recent decades Zilog has refocused on the ever-growing market for embedded systems and the most recent Z80-compatible microcontroller family , the fully pipelined 24-bit eZ80 with a linear 16 MB address range , has been successfully introduced alongside the simpler Z80 and Z180 products .",

The name Windows API collectively refers to several different platform implementations that are often referred to by their own names ( for example , Win32 API ) ; see the versions section . Almost all Windows programs interact with the Windows API . On the Windows NT line of operating systems , a small number ( such as programs started early in the Windows startup process ) use the Native API . Developer support is available in the form of a software development kit , Microsoft Windows SDK , providing documentation and tools needed to build software based on the Windows API and associated Windows interfaces . The Windows API ( Win32 ) is focused mainly on the programming language C in that its exposed functions and data structures are described in that language in recent versions of its documentation . However , the API may be used by any programming language compiler or assembler able to handle the ( well-defined ) low-level data structures along with the prescribed calling conventions for calls and callbacks . Similarly , the internal implementation of the API 's function has been developed in several languages , historically . Despite the fact that C is not an object-oriented programming language , the Windows API and Windows have both historically been described as object-oriented . There have also been many wrapper classes and extensions ( from Microsoft and others ) for object-oriented languages that make this object-oriented structure more explicit ( Microsoft Foundation Class Library ( MFC ) , Visual Component Library ( VCL ) , GDI+ , etc. ) .

Initially the 1900 series machines , like the Ferranti-Packard 6000 on which they were based , ran a simple operating system known as executive which allowed the system operator to load and run programs from a Teletype Model 33 ASR based system console . In December 1964 ICT set up an Operating Systems Branch to develop a new operating system for the 1906/7 . The branch was initially staffed with people being released by the end of work on the OMP operating system for the Ferranti Orion . The initial design of the new system , named George after George E. Felton head of the Basic Programming Division , was based on ideas from the Orion and the spooling system of the Atlas computer . ( In public it was claimed that George stood for GEneral ORGanisational Environment , but contemporary sources say that was a backronym ) . In July 1965 a team from ICT was present at a seminar at NPL describing the CTSS operating system developed for MIT 's Project MAC . They decided that the ICT would need to provide multi-access facilities , known to ICT as MOP , Multiple Online Processing . In November 1965 H. P. Goodman , head of the Operating Systems Branch attended the Fall Joint Computer Conference in Las Vegas where plans for Multics were initially described . Some of the Multics features discussed influenced future development of George , notably the tree structured filestore . Towards the end of 1965 ICT marketing requested that a simpler operating system be made available quickly , especially for the smaller members of the range ."
