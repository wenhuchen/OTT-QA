  "/wiki/Metre_per_second": "The metre per second is an SI derived unit of both speed ( scalar quantity ) and velocity ( vector quantity ( which have direction and magnitude ) ) , equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one metre in a time of one second . The SI unit symbols are m/s , m\u00b7s\u22121 , m s\u22121 , or m/s , sometimes ( unofficially ) abbreviated as mps . [ citation needed ]",
  "/wiki/Speed": "In everyday use and in kinematics , the speed of an object is the magnitude of its velocity ( the rate of change of its position ) ; it is thus a scalar quantity . The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval ; the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero . Speed has the dimensions of distance divided by time . The SI unit of speed is the metre per second , but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour or , in the US and the UK , miles per hour . For air and marine travel the knot is commonly used . The fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel , according to special relativity , is the speed of light in a vacuum c = 299792458 metres per second ( approximately 1079000000 km/h or 671000000 mph ) . Matter can not quite reach the speed of light , as this would require an infinite amount of energy . In relativity physics , the concept of rapidity replaces the classical idea of speed .",
  "/wiki/Velocity": "The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of reference , and is a function of time . Velocity is equivalent to a specification of an object 's speed and direction of motion ( e.g . 60 km/h to the north ) . Velocity is a fundamental concept in kinematics , the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies . Velocity is a physical vector quantity ; both magnitude and direction are needed to define it . The scalar absolute value ( magnitude ) of velocity is called speed , being a coherent derived unit whose quantity is measured in the SI ( metric system ) as metres per second ( m/s ) or as the SI base unit of ( m\u22c5s\u22121 ) . For example , 5 metres per second is a scalar , whereas 5 metres per second east is a vector . If there is a change in speed , direction or both , then the object has a changing velocity and is said to be undergoing an acceleration .",
  "/wiki/Metre_per_second_squared": "The metre per second squared is the unit of acceleration in the International System of Units ( SI ) . As a derived unit , it is composed from the SI base units of length , the metre , and time , the second . Its symbol is written in several forms as m/s2 , m\u00b7s\u22122 or m s\u22122 , or less commonly , as m/s/s . As acceleration , the unit is interpreted physically as change in velocity or speed per time interval , i.e . metre per second per second and is treated as a vector quantity .",
  "/wiki/Acceleration": "In mechanics , acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time . Accelerations are vector quantities ( they have magnitude and direction ) . The orientation of an object 's acceleration is given by the orientation of the net force acting on that object . The magnitude of an object 's acceleration , as described by Newton 's Second Law. , is the combined effect of two causes :",
  "/wiki/Jerk_(physics)": "In physics , jerk ( also known as jolt ) is the rate at which an object 's acceleration changes with respect to time . Jerk is a vector quantity ( magnitude and direction ) , and can be expressed in m/s3 ( in SI units ) or in standard gravities per second ( g/s ) . Jerk is the time derivative of acceleration , the second derivative of velocity , and the third derivative of position . Jounce , also known as snap , is the fourth derivative of position and the first derivative of jerk .",

  "/wiki/Radian_per_second": "The radian per second ( symbol : rad\u00b7s\u22121 or rad/s ) is the SI unit of rotational speed ( angular velocity ) , commonly denoted by the Greek letter \u03c9 ( omega ) . The radian per second is also the unit of angular frequency . The radian per second is defined as the change in the orientation of an object , in radians , every second .",
  "/wiki/Angular_velocity": "In physics , angular velocity refers to how fast an object rotates or revolves relative to another point , i.e . how fast the angular position or orientation of an object changes with time . There are two types of angular velocity : orbital angular velocity and spin angular velocity . Spin angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body rotates with respect to its centre of rotation . Orbital angular velocity refers to how fast a point object revolves about a fixed origin , i.e . the time rate of change of its angular position relative to the origin . Spin angular velocity is independent of the choice of origin , in contrast to orbital angular velocity which depends on the choice of origin . In general , angular velocity is measured in angle per unit time , e.g . radians per second . The SI unit of angular velocity is expressed as radians/sec with the radian having a dimensionless value of unity , thus the SI units of angular velocity are listed as 1/sec . Angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega ( \u03c9 , sometimes \u03a9 ) . By convention , positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation , while negative is clockwise .",
  "/wiki/Radian_per_second_squared": "Angular acceleration is the time rate of change of angular velocity . In three dimensions , it is a pseudovector . In SI units , it is measured in radians per second squared ( rad/s2 ) , and is usually denoted by the Greek letter alpha ( \u03b1 ) . Just like angular velocity , there are two types of angular acceleration : spin angular acceleration and orbital angular acceleration , representing the time rate of change of spin angular velocity and orbital angular velocity respectively . Unlike linear acceleration , angular acceleration need not be caused by a net external torque . For example , a figure skater can speed up her rotation ( thereby obtaining an angular acceleration ) simply by contracting her arms inwards , which involves no external torque .",

  "/wiki/Frequency_drift": "In electrical engineering , and particularly in telecommunications , frequency drift is an unintended and generally arbitrary offset of an oscillator from its nominal frequency . Causes may include component aging , changes in temperature that alter the piezoelectric effect in a crystal oscillator , or problems with a voltage regulator which controls the bias voltage to the oscillator . Frequency drift is traditionally measured in Hz/s . Frequency stability can be regarded as the absence ( or a very low level ) of frequency drift . On a radio transmitter , frequency drift can cause a radio station to drift into an adjacent channel , causing illegal interference . Because of this , Frequency allocation regulations specify the allowed tolerance for such oscillators in a type-accepted device . A temperature-compensated , voltage-controlled crystal oscillator ( TCVCXO ) is normally used for frequency modulation . On the receiver side , frequency drift was mainly a problem in early tuners , particularly for analog dial tuning , and especially on FM , which exhibits a capture effect . However , the use of a phase-locked loop ( PLL ) essentially eliminates the drift issue . For transmitters , a numerically controlled oscillator ( NCO ) also does not have problems with drift . Drift differs from Doppler shift , which is a perceived difference in frequency due to motion of the source or receiver , even though the source is still producing the same wavelength . It also differs from frequency deviation , which is the inherent and necessary result of modulation in both FM and phase modulation .",
  "/wiki/Cubic_metre_per_second": "A cubic metre per second ( m3s\u22121 , m3/s , cumecs or cubic meter per second in American English ) is a derived SI unit of volumetric flow rate equal to that of a stere or cube with sides of one metre ( ~39.37 in ) in length exchanged or moving each second . It is popularly used for water flow , especially in rivers and streams , and fractions for HVAC values measuring air flow . The term cumec is also used , as shorthand for Cubic metres per second , with the plural form cumecs also common in speech . [ citation needed ] It is commonly used between workers in the measurement of water flow through natural streams and civil works , but rarely used in writing . Data in units of cumec are used along the y-axis or vertical axis of a flow hydrograph , which describes the time variation of discharge of a river ( the mean velocity multiplied by cross-sectional area ) . A moderately sized river discharges in the order of 100 cumecs .",
  "/wiki/Volumetric_flow": "In physics and engineering , in particular fluid dynamics and hydrometry , the volumetric flow rate ( also known as volume flow rate , rate of fluid flow or volume velocity ) is the volume of fluid which passes per unit time ; usually represented by the symbol Q ( sometimes V\u0307 ) . The SI unit is cubic metres per second ( m3/s ) . Another unit used is standard cubic centimetres per minute ( sccm ) . In US customary units and imperial units , volumetric flow rate is often expressed as cubic feet per second ( ft3/s ) or gallons per minute ( either US or imperial definitions ) . Volumetric flow rate should not be confused with volumetric flux , as defined by Darcy 's law and represented by the symbol q , with units of m3/ ( m2\u00b7s ) , that is , m\u00b7s\u22121 . The integration of a flux over an area gives the volumetric flow rate ."
