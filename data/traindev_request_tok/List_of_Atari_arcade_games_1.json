  "/wiki/APB_(1987_video_game)": "APB ( All Points Bulletin ) is a 1987 arcade game by Atari Games . The player assumes the role of Officer Bob , a rookie police officer . As Bob , players drive around the city , ticketing motorists for minor infractions and pulling over more serious offenders . Eventually , players must apprehend criminals for which an all-points bulletin has been called . The arcade cabinet was created to look like a police car , with a gas pedal , steering wheel and a siren button , complete with flashing lights atop the unit . The game 's cartoonish visuals and sense of humor gained it positive reviews . However , the game was slightly criticized for its difficulty ; the game 's developers later admitted that a long development cycle had resulted in the gameplay growing more complicated than originally planned . Ports of APB were released for the Amiga , Atari ST , Commodore 64 , and ZX Spectrum in 1989 . A version for the Atari Lynx handheld was published later , in 1991 .",

  "/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare": "Anti-aircraft warfare or counter-air defence is defined by NATO as all measures designed to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air action . They include surface based , subsurface ( submarine launched ) , and air-based weapon systems , associated sensor systems , command and control arrangements and passive measures ( e.g . barrage balloons ) . It may be used to protect naval , ground , and air forces in any location . However , for most countries the main effort has tended to be 'homeland defence ' . NATO refers to airborne air defence as counter-air and naval air defence as anti-aircraft warfare . Missile defence is an extension of air defence as are initiatives to adapt air defence to the task of intercepting any projectile in flight . In some countries , such as Britain and Germany during the Second World War , the Soviet Union , NATO , and the United States , ground-based air defence and air defence aircraft have been under integrated command and control . However , while overall air defence may be for homeland defence including military facilities , forces in the field , wherever they are , invariably deploy their own air defence capability if there is an air threat . A surface-based air defence capability can also be deployed offensively to deny the use of airspace to an opponent . Until the 1950s , guns firing ballistic munitions ranging from 7.62 mm to 152.4 mm [ citation needed ] were the standard weapons ; guided missiles then became dominant , except at the very shortest ranges ( as with close-in weapon systems , which typically use rotary autocannons or , in very modern systems , surface-to-air adaptations of short range air-to-air missiles , often combined in one system with rotary cannons ) .",

The facility is officially called Homey Airport ( KXTA ) or Groom Lake , named after the salt flat situated next to its airfield . Details of the facility 's operations are not publicly known , but the USAF says that it is an open training range , and it most likely supports the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems . The USAF acquired the site in 1955 , primarily for flight testing the Lockheed U-2 aircraft . The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it the frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component of unidentified flying object ( UFO ) folklore . The base has never been declared a secret base , but all research and occurrences in Area 51 are Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information ( TS/SCI ) . The CIA publicly acknowledged the existence of the base for the first time on June 25 , 2013 , following a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request filed in 2005 , and they declassified documents detailing the history and purpose of Area 51 . Area 51 is located in the southern portion of Nevada in the western United States , 83 miles ( 134 km ) north-northwest of Las Vegas .

  "/wiki/Baseball": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding . The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team , called the pitcher , throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat . The objective of the offensive team ( batting team ) is to hit the ball into the field of play , allowing its players to run the bases , having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs . The objective of the defensive team ( fielding team ) is to prevent batters from becoming runners , and to prevent runners ' advance around the bases . A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning .",

  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one . Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States , basketball has evolved to become one of the world 's most popular and widely viewed sports .

  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",
