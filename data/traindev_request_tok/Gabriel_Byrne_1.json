  "/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",

His expeditions , sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain , were the first European contact with the Caribbean , Central America , and South America . Columbus 's early life is somewhat obscure , but scholars generally agree that he was born in the Republic of Genoa and spoke a dialect of Ligurian as his first language . He went to sea at a young age and travelled widely , as far north as the British Isles ( and possibly Iceland ) and as far south as what is now Ghana . He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo and was based in Lisbon for several years , but later took a Castilian mistress ; he had one son with each woman . Though largely self-educated , Columbus was widely read in geography , astronomy , and history . He formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the East Indies , hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade . Following persistent lobbying , Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II agreed to sponsor a journey west , in the name of the Crown of Castile . Columbus left Castile in August 1492 with three ships , and after a stopover in the Canary Islands made landfall in the Americas on 12 October ( later celebrated as Columbus Day ) . His landing place was an island in the Bahamas , known by its native inhabitants as Guanahani ; its exact location is uncertain . Columbus subsequently visited the islands now known as Cuba and Hispaniola , establishing a colony in what is now Haiti - the first European settlement in the Americas since the Norse colonies nearly 500 years earlier . He arrived back in Castile in early 1493 , bringing a number of captive natives with him .",
