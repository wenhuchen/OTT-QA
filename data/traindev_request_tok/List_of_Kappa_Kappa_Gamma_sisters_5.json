Emily Dunning was born in Scarsdale , New York to Edwin James Dunning and Frances Gore Lang . The well-to-do New York family fell on hard times when she was about ten years old , and her father left for Europe to try to recoup his fortune , leaving her mother with five children . When a well-meaning friend of Dunning 's mother suggested that the girl might become a milliner 's apprentice , her mother said That settles the question . You are going to go to college . Dr. Mary Corinna Putnam Jacobi , a friend of the family , recommended Cornell University 's medical preparatory course , and her uncle , Henry W. Sage , a founder of Cornell , agreed to pay her tuition . Other family friends also helped with expenses . Emily Dunning graduated in 1897 and decided to attend the College of Medicine of the New York Infirmary . During her sophomore year there , the college merged with the new Cornell University School of Medicine . She earned her medical degree in 1901 , then received the second highest grade in the qualifying exam for an internship at Gouverneur Hospital in New York City . The hospital denied her application . The next year she applied again , this time with the support from political and religious figures , and the hospital accepted her - the first woman ever accepted for post-graduate surgical training in service to a hospital .",

Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White , the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge - from the classics to the sciences , and from the theoretical to the applied . These ideals , unconventional for the time , are captured in Cornell 's founding principle , a popular 1868 Ezra Cornell quotation : I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study . The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus , with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy . The university also administers two satellite medical campuses , one in New York City and one in Education City , Qatar , and Cornell Tech , a graduate program that incorporates technology , business , and creative thinking . The program moved from Google 's Chelsea Building in New York City to its permanent campus on Roosevelt Island in September 2017 . Cornell is one of ten private land grant universities in the United States and the only one in New York .

It is the state 's oldest university and the largest in the University of Nebraska system . The state legislature chartered the university in 1869 as a land-grant university under the 1862 Morrill Act , two years after Nebraska became a state . Around the turn of the 20th century , the university began to expand significantly , hiring professors from eastern schools to teach its new professional programs and conducting groundbreaking research in agricultural sciences . The Nebraska method of ecological study developed during this time pioneered grassland ecology and laid the foundation for research in theoretical ecology for the rest of the century . The university is organized into eight colleges on two campuses in Lincoln with over 100 classroom buildings and research facilities . Nebraska 's athletic programs , known as the Cornhuskers , compete in NCAA Division I and are a member of the Big Ten Conference . NU 's football team has won 46 conference championships and claims five national championships , with an additional nine unclaimed .

  "/wiki/Folkloristics": "Folklore studies , also known as folkloristics , and occasionally tradition studies or folk life studies in the United Kingdom , is the formal academic discipline devoted to the study of folklore . This term , along with its synonyms , [ note 1 ] gained currency in the 1950s to distinguish the academic study of traditional culture from the folklore artifacts themselves .

  "/wiki/Biology": "Biology is the natural science that studies life and living organisms , including their physical structure , chemical processes , molecular interactions , physiological mechanisms , development and evolution . Despite the complexity of the science , there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it into a single , coherent field . Biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life , genes as the basic unit of heredity , and evolution as the engine that propels the creation and extinction of species . Living organisms are open systems that survive by transforming energy and decreasing their local entropy to maintain a stable and vital condition defined as homeostasis . Sub-disciplines of biology are defined by the research methods employed and the kind of system studied : theoretical biology uses mathematical methods to formulate quantitative models while experimental biology performs empirical experiments to test the validity of proposed theories and understand the mechanisms underlying life and how it appeared and evolved from non-living matter about 4 billion years ago through a gradual increase in the complexity of the system .

Its faculty and student populations grew after 1890 with rapid expansion of the physical campus and scientific research . Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools : the original undergraduate college , the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools . While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation , each school 's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs . In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven , the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven , a campus in West Haven , Connecticut and forest and nature preserves throughout New England .

  "/wiki/Astrogeologist": "Planetary geology , alternatively known as astrogeology or exogeology , is a planetary science discipline concerned with the geology of the celestial bodies such as the planets and their moons , asteroids , comets , and meteorites . Although the geo- prefix typically indicates topics of or relating to Earth , planetary geology is named as such for historical and convenience reasons ; due to the types of investigations involved , it is closely linked with Earth-based geology . Planetary geology includes such topics as determining the internal structure of the terrestrial planets , and also looks at planetary volcanism and surface processes such as impact craters , fluvial and aeolian processes . The structures of the giant planets and their moons are also examined , as is the make-up of the minor bodies of the Solar System , such as asteroids , the Kuiper Belt , and comets .",
  "/wiki/Apollo_11": "Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon . Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 , 1969 , at 20:17 UTC . Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC ; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later . They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft , and they collected 47.5 pounds ( 21.5 kg ) of lunar material to bring back to Earth . Command module pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon 's surface . Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours , 36 minutes on the lunar surface at a site they named Tranquility Base before lifting off to rejoin Columbia in lunar orbit . Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island , Florida , on July 16 at 13:32 UTC , and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA 's Apollo program . The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a command module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , the only part that returned to Earth ; a service module ( SM ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( LM ) that had two stages - a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20 . The astronauts used Eagle 's ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module . They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth ."
