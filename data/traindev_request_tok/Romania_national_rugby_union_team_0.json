  "/wiki/Italy_national_rugby_union_team": "The Italy national rugby union team is the representative national team in the sport of rugby union for the nation of Italy . The team is known as gli Azzurri ( the Blues ) . Savoy blue is the common colour of the national teams representing Italy , as it is the traditional colour of the royal House of Savoy which reigned over the Kingdom of Italy from 1860 to 1946 . Italy has played international rugby since 1929 , and for decades was considered one of the best European teams outside the Five Nations Championship . Since 2000 , Italy has competed annually in the Six Nations Championship with England , France , Ireland , Scotland and Wales . In 2013 , they were holders of the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy which is played annually between Italy and France . Italy is ranked 14th in the world by the IRB as of 30 September 2019 . Italian rugby rose to prominence in 2000 when it was added to the Five Nations , creating the Six Nations . Initially on the receiving end of some heavy defeats , the side has grown in competitiveness , recording a fourth-place finish in 2007 and 2013 , and one-sided defeats have become less frequent . The Azzurri have shown respectable results when playing at home in recent years : they defeated France 22-21 in the 2011 Six Nations ; and during the 2013 Six Nations , they again beat France 23-18 , also defeating Ireland 22-15 . However , Italy has not won a Six Nations match since their 22-19 away win against Scotland in Round 3 of the 2015 tournament , losing every game since ; this equates to a losing run of 22 matches . The Italian team has also competed at every Rugby World Cup since the first tournament in 1987 , where Italy played the inaugural game against New Zealand , but is yet to progress beyond the first round .",
