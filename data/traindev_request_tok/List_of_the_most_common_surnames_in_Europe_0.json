Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson , and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy .

Iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet Mars . The red color of blood comes from the protein hemoglobin , while ripe strawberries , red apples and reddish autumn leaves are colored by anthocyanins . Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art . The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies ; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories . It was also an important color in China , where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces . :60-61 In the Renaissance , the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal .

  "/wiki/Child_exposure": "Child abandonment is the practice of relinquishing interests and claims over one 's offspring in an extralegal way with the intent of never again resuming or reasserting guardianship over them . Typically the phrase is used to describe the physical abandoning of a child , but it can also include severe cases of neglect and emotional abandonment , such as in the case of a parent who fails to offer financial and emotional support for his or her child over a long period of time . An abandoned child is referred to as a foundling ( as opposed to a runaway or an orphan ) . Baby dumping refers to parents leaving a child younger than 12 months in a public or private place with the intent of terminating their care for the child . It is also known as rehoming , in cases where adoptive parents use illegal means , such as the internet , to find a new home for their child . In most cases , child abandonment is classified under a subsection of child abuse statutes and is punishable with a felony . Following felonious charges , one or both guardians give up their parental rights over the child thus severing their relationship with the child . Some states allow for a reinstatement of parental rights , in which case the parent or parents can have a relationship with the child again . However , it is unlikely that the parents can ever regain custody .

  "/wiki/Dove": "Columbidae is a bird family constituted of pigeons and doves . These are stout-bodied birds with short necks , and short slender bills that in some species feature fleshy ceres . They primarily feed on seeds , fruits , and plants . The family occurs worldwide , but the greatest variety is in the Indomalaya and Australasia ecozones . The animal order Columbiformes is also constituted of pigeons and doves , and includes about 42 genera and 310 species . The distinction between doves and pigeons in English is not consistent , and does not exist in most other languages . In contrast , in scientific and ornithological practice , dove tends to be used for smaller species and pigeon for larger ones , but this is in no way consistently applied . Historically , the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between the terms . The bird most commonly referred to as just pigeon is the domestic pigeon , which is common in many cities as the feral pigeon . Pigeon is a French word that derives from the Latin pipio , for a peeping chick , while dove is a Germanic word that refers to the bird 's diving flight . The English dialectal word culver appears to derive from Latin columba . Doves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests , often using sticks and other debris , which may be placed on trees , ledges , or the ground , depending on species .",

  "/wiki/Coast": "The coast , also known as the coastline or seashore , is the area where land meets the sea or ocean , or a line that forms the boundary between the land and the ocean or a lake . A precise line that can be called a coastline can not be determined due to the coastline paradox . The term coastal zone is a region where interaction of the sea and land processes occurs . Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region ( e.g. , New Zealand 's West Coast , or the East and West Coasts of the United States ) . Edinburgh is an example city on the coast of Great Britain . The term pelagic coast refers to a coast that fronts the open ocean , as opposed to a more sheltered coast in a gulf or bay . A shore , on the other hand , can refer to parts of land adjoining any large body of water , including oceans ( seashore ) and lakes ( lake shore ) . Similarly , the somewhat related term stream bed or stream bank refers to the land alongside or sloping down to a river ( riverbank ) or body of water smaller than a lake . Bank is also used in some parts of the world to refer to an artificial ridge of earth intended to retain the water of a river or pond ; in other places this may be called a levee . While many scientific experts might agree on a common definition of the term coast , the delineation of the extents of a coast differ according to jurisdiction , with many scientific and government authorities in various countries differing for economic and social policy reasons . According to the UN atlas , 44% of people live within 150 km ( 93 mi ) of the sea .",
  "/wiki/Mancini": "Mancini ( Italian pronunciation : [ man\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0ni ] ) is a surname of Italian origin which , etymologically , comes from the Italian adjective mancino , which literally means left handed .",
  "/wiki/Left_handed": "In human biology , handedness is a better , faster , or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand , known as the dominant hand ; the incapable , less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand . Right-handedness is the most common form , and it is estimated that around 90% of the worlds population is right-handed . Handedness is often defined by which hand one writes with , as it is fairly common for people to prefer to do some tasks with each hand . However , true mixed-handedness is rare , as most people clearly prefer one hand for most purposes . Most of the current research would suggest that left handedness has an epigenetic marker , a combination of genetics , biology and the environment . Because the vast majority of the population is right-handed , many devices are designed for use by a right-handed person , which makes their use by left-handed people more difficult . In many countries across the world , left-handed people are or were required to write with their right hand . However , left-handed people have an advantage in sports that involve aiming at a target , because their opponents will be more accustomed to the right-handed majority . As a result , they are over-represented in baseball , tennis , fencing , cricket , and boxing .",
