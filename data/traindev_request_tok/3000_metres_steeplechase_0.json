Light 's design , now listed as national heritage , set out the city centre in a grid layout , interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares , and entirely surrounded by parklands . Early colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers , in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities . Until the post-war era , it was Australia 's third-largest city . It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms , and became known as the City of Churches due to its diversity of faiths .
