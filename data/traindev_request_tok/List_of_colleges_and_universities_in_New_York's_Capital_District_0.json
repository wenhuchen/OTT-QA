  "/wiki/Medical_school": "A medical school is a tertiary educational institution , or part of such an institution , that teaches medicine , and awards a professional degree for physicians and surgeons . Such medical degrees include the Bachelor of Medicine , Bachelor of Surgery ( MBBS , MBChB , BMBS ) , Doctor of Medicine ( MD ) , or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine ( DO ) . Many medical schools offer additional degrees , such as a Doctor of Philosophy ( Ph.D ) , Master 's degree ( M.Sc ) , a physician assistant program , or other post-secondary education .

  "/wiki/Proprietary_colleges": "Proprietary colleges are for-profit colleges and universities . They are operated by their owners or investors , rather than a not-for-profit institution , religious organization , or government . Because they are not funded by tax money , their long-term sustainability is dependent on the value they provide relative to the perceived value of a degree from a higher educational institution overall . The increased reliance on federal student aid funds by these for profit schools is of growing concern . Since federal student loans are typically guaranteed by the government , for-profit colleges can reap a profit from taxpayers even if students drop out after enrolling , do not complete a degree , or the degree turns out to be nearly worthless for future employment . Students can be stuck with large and unmanageable debt loads , defaulting at a significantly higher rate than students at traditional non-profit institutions . Non-profit institutions generally depend in part on academic excellence and creating graduates that succeed in their fields , while for-profit schools are often based on attracting large numbers of students with few requirements in terms of academic qualifications for entry , because federal loans are provided for good and bad students alike . Some institutions in this category are regionally accredited , while many others are not . Sometimes a proprietary college may also overlap with the sector of non-degree granting business colleges . Students should exercise caution , before enrolling , about the validity and transferability of the degrees and credits earned at proprietary colleges . If a college is not regionally accredited , its credits will probably not be accepted by other colleges , and its degrees or certificates may not be recognized by employers . Every college claims to be accredited , but except in some specific areas such as nursing , regional accreditation is by far the most important type of accreditation .",

A distinction is typically made between graduate schools ( where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession ) and professional schools , which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine , nursing , business , engineering , speech-language pathology , or law . The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute since various professional schools offer graduate degrees and vice versa . Many universities award graduate degrees ; a graduate school is not necessarily a separate institution . While the term graduate school is typical in the United States and often used elsewhere ( e.g. , Canada ) , postgraduate education is also used in English-speaking countries ( Australia , Bangladesh , Canada , India , Ireland , New Zealand , Pakistan , and the UK ) to refer to the spectrum of education beyond a bachelor 's degree . Those attending graduate schools are called graduate students ( in both American and British English ) , or often in British English as postgraduate students and , colloquially , postgraduates and postgrads . Degrees awarded to graduate students include master 's degrees , doctoral degrees , and other postgraduate qualifications such as graduate certificates and professional degrees . Producing original research is a significant component of graduate studies in the humanities , natural sciences and social sciences . This research typically leads to the writing and defense of a thesis or dissertation . In graduate programs that are oriented toward professional training ( e.g. , MPA , MBA , MHA ) , the degrees may consist solely of coursework , without an original research or thesis component . The term graduate school is primarily North American . Additionally , in North America , the term does not usually refer to medical school ( whose students are called medical students ) , and only occasionally refers to law school or business school ; these are often collectively termed professional schools .",
