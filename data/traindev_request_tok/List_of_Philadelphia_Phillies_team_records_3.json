  "/wiki/Home_run": "In baseball , a home run ( abbreviated HR ) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process . In modern baseball , the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles ( or making contact with either foul pole ) without first touching the ground , resulting in an automatic home run . There is also the inside-the-park home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field . A home run with a high exit velocity and good launch angle is sometimes called a no-doubter , because it leaves no doubt that it is going to leave the park when it leaves the bat . When a home run is scored , the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored , and an RBI for each runner that scores , including himself . Likewise , the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit and a run , with additional runs charged for each runner that scores other than the batter . Home runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and , as a result , prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams - hence the old saying , Home run hitters drive Cadillacs , and singles hitters drive Fords ( coined , circa 1948 , by veteran pitcher Fritz Ostermueller , by way of mentoring his young teammate , Ralph Kiner ) .",
  "/wiki/1998_Major_League_Baseball_season": "The 1998 Major League Baseball season ended with the New York Yankees sweeping the San Diego Padres in the World Series , after they had won a then AL record 114 regular season games . The Yankees finished with 125 wins for the season ( regular season and playoffs combined ) , which remains the MLB record . The 1998 season was also marked by an expansion to 30 teams ( 16 in the NL , 14 in the AL ) , with two new teams-the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League , and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the American League-added to the MLB ( as of 2019 , this is the last time MLB has expanded ) . To keep the leagues with even numbers of teams while allowing both leagues to have a new team , the Milwaukee Brewers were moved from the American League Central Division to the National League Central Division . The Detroit Tigers were shifted from the American League East to the American League Central , while the Devil Rays were added to the American League East . The Diamondbacks were added to the National League West , making the NL have more teams than the AL for the first time ( this arrangement would last until the end of the 2012 season , when the Houston Astros moved from the National to the American League for 2013 , giving each league 15 teams ) . The biggest story of the season was the historic chase of the single-season home run record held at the time by Roger Maris . Initially , the St. Louis Cardinals ' Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey , Jr. of the Seattle Mariners started the season on a pace to both break Maris ' record . In June , the chase was joined by the Chicago Cubs ' Sammy Sosa , who broke the decades-old record of Rudy York for most home runs in a calendar month with 20 that month . Eventually , Griffey fell off the record pace , but still ended with 56 homers . Both McGwire and Sosa broke the record in September , with McGwire ultimately finishing with 70 homers to Sosa 's 66 . McGwire 's record would last only three years , with Barry Bonds hitting 73 in 2001 .",

The regular season ended on October 1 , extended a day for tiebreaker games to decide the winners of the National League Central and National League West divisions . The postseason began on October 2 . The World Series began on October 23 , and ended on October 28 with the Boston Red Sox defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games to win their ninth World Series championship . The 89th Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held on July 17 at Nationals Park , the home of the Washington Nationals . The American League won , 8-6 , in 10 innings .

  "/wiki/Run_(baseball)": "In baseball , a run is scored when a player advances around first , second and third base and returns safely to home plate , touching the bases in that order , before three outs are recorded and all obligations to reach base safely on batted balls are met or assured . A player may score by hitting a home run or by any combination of plays that puts him safely on base ( that is , on first , second , or third ) as a runner and subsequently brings him home . The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent . The Official Baseball Rules hold that if the third out of an inning is a force out of a runner advancing to any base then , even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that force out is made , his run does not count . However , if the third out is not a force out , but a tag out , then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made , his run will count . In baseball statistics , a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run ( R ) , sometimes referred to as a run scored . While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic , it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in ( RBIs ) . Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent ; however , the sabermetric statistic runs created provides a more sophisticated assessment of a player 's contribution toward producing runs for his team . A pitcher is likewise assessed runs surrendered in his statistics , which differentiate between standard earned runs ( for which the pitcher is statistically assigned full responsibility ) and unearned runs scored due to fielding errors , which do not count in his personal statistics . Specifically , if a fielding error occurs which affects the number of runs scored in an inning , the Official Scorer - the official in-game statistician - in order to determine how many of the runs should be classified as earned , will reconstruct the inning as if the error had not occurred . For example , with two outs , suppose a runner reaches base because of a fielding error , and then the next batter hits a two-run home run , and then the following batter then makes the third out , ending the inning . If the inning is reconstructed without the error , and if that third batter , instead of reaching on an error , registered an out , the inning would have ended there without any runs scoring .",
  "/wiki/1985_Major_League_Baseball_season": "The 1985 Major League Baseball season ended with the Kansas City Royals defeating the St. Louis Cardinals in the seventh game of the I-70 World Series . Bret Saberhagen , the regular season Cy Young Award winner , was named MVP of the Series . The National League won the All-Star Game for the second straight year . The League Championship Series playoffs were expanded to a best-of-seven format beginning this year , and both leagues ended up settling their pennant winners in more than five games , with the Royals beating the Toronto Blue Jays in seven games , and the Cardinals beating the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games .",
  "/wiki/Hit_(baseball)": "In baseball statistics , a hit ( denoted by H ) , also called a base hit , is credited to a batter when the batter safely reaches first base after hitting the ball into fair territory , without the benefit of an error or a fielder 's choice .",
  "/wiki/Double_(baseball)": "In baseball , a double is the act of a batter striking the pitched ball and safely reaching second base without being called out by the umpire , without the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) or another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A double is a type of hit ( the others being the single , triple and home run ) and is sometimes called a two-bagger or two-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 2B .",
  "/wiki/1976_Major_League_Baseball_season": "The 1976 Major League Baseball season was the last season of the expansion era ( dating back to 1961 ) until 1993 in which the American League ( AL ) and the National League ( NL ) had the same number of teams . The season ended with the Cincinnati Reds taking the World Series Championship for the second consecutive season by sweeping the New York Yankees in four games ; they are the only team to go undefeated in the postseason since the advent of the divisional era in 1969 . It would be the Reds ' last title until Lou Piniella guided the club in 1990 , and the second time that the Yankees were swept in World Series history . The only team to do it before was the 1963 Los Angeles Dodgers .",
  "/wiki/Triple_(baseball)": "In baseball , a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball , with neither the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) nor another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A triple is sometimes called a three-bagger or three-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 3B . Triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball . It often requires a ball hit to a distant part of the field , or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield . It also usually requires that the batter hit the ball solidly , and be a speedy runner . It also often requires that the batter 's team have a good strategic reason for wanting the batter on third base , as a double will already put the batter in scoring position and there will often be little strategic advantage to taking the risk of trying to stretch a double into a triple . ( The inside-the-park home run is much rarer than a triple ) . The trend for modern ballparks is to have smaller outfields ( often increasing the number of home runs ) ; it has ensured that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of those who played early in Major League Baseball history , generally in the dead-ball era . A walk-off triple ( one that ends a game ) occurs very infrequently . For example , the 2016 MLB season saw only three walk-off triples , excluding one play that was actually a triple plus an error .",

  "/wiki/Total_bases": "In baseball statistics , total bases is the number of bases a player has gained with hits . It is a weighted sum for which the weight value is 1 for a single , 2 for a double , 3 for a triple and 4 for a home run . Only bases attained from hits count toward this total . Reaching base by other means ( such as a base on balls ) or advancing further after the hit ( such as when a subsequent batter gets a hit ) does not increase the player 's total bases . In box scores and other statistical summaries , total bases is often denoted by the abbreviation TB . The total bases divided by the number of at bats is the player 's slugging average .",
  "/wiki/1990_Major_League_Baseball_season": "The 1990 Major League Baseball season saw the Cincinnati Reds upset the heavily favored Oakland Athletics in the World Series , for their first title since 1976 .",
  "/wiki/Strikeout": "In baseball or softball , a strikeout ( or strike-out ) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat . It usually means the batter is out . A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",

  "/wiki/Stolen_base": "In baseball , a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner . The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base , but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10 . A stolen base most often occurs when a base runner advances to the next base while the pitcher is pitching the ball to home plate . Successful base stealers are not only fast but have good baserunning instincts and timing ."
