  "/wiki/Masonic_Lodge_(Grandin,_Missouri)": "The Missouri Lumber and Mining Company ( MLM ) was a large timber corporation with headquarters and primary operations in southeast Missouri . The company was formed by Pennsylvania lumbermen who were eager to exploit the untapped timber resources of the Missouri Ozarks to supply lumber , primarily used in construction , to meet the demand of U.S. westward expansion . Its primary operations were centered in Grandin , a company town it built starting c. 1888 . The lumber mill there grew to be the largest in the country at the turn of the century and Grandin 's population peaked around 2,500 to 3,000 . As the timber resources were exhaused , the company had to abandon Grandin around 1910 . It continued timber harvesting in other parts of Missouri for another decade . While some of the buildings in Grandin were relocated , many of the remaining buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 as part of the state 's historic preservation plan which considered the MLM a significant technological and economic contributor to Missouri .",

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland .",
  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

  "/wiki/Classical_Revival_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
