  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",
  "/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)": "During the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , the Union , also known as the North , referred to the United States of America , specifically to the national government of President Abraham Lincoln and the 20 free states and five border states that supported it . The Union was dedicated to the defeat and termination of the Confederate States of America , informally called the Confederacy or the South . The Union Army was a new formation comprising mostly state units , together with some units from the regular U.S. Army . The Border states were essential as a supply base for the Union invasion of the Confederacy , and Lincoln realized he could not win the war without control of them , especially Maryland , which lay north of the national capital of Washington , D.C . The Northeast and upper Midwest provided the industrial resources for a mechanized war producing large quantities of munitions and supplies , as well as financing for the war . The Midwest provided soldiers , food , horses , financial support , and training camps . Army hospitals were set up across the Union . Most states had Republican Party governors who energetically supported the war effort and suppressed anti-war subversion in 1863-64 . The Democratic Party strongly supported the war at the beginning in 1861 , but by 1862 , was split between the War Democrats and the anti-war element known as Peace Democrats , led by the extremist Copperheads . The Democrats made major electoral gains in 1862 in state elections , most notably in New York . They lost ground in 1863 , especially in Ohio . In 1864 , the Republicans campaigned under the National Union Party banner , which attracted many War Democrats and soldiers and scored a landslide victory for Lincoln and his entire ticket against Democratic candidate George B. McClellan .",

In other common law jurisdictions , the equivalent position is called Puisne Justice . In the United States , judicial panels are non-hierarchical , so an associate judge has the same responsibilities with respect to cases as the chief judge . An associate judge usually has fewer or different administrative responsibilities than the chief . On the Supreme Court of the United States , the most junior associate justice ( currently Justice Brett Kavanaugh ) , has the task of answering the door when the Justices are in private conference .

  "/wiki/United_States_Senate": "The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress , which , along with the United States House of Representatives - the lower chamber - constitutes the legislature of the United States . The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building , in Washington , D.C . The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators , each of whom represents a single state in its entirety . Each state , regardless of its population size , is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years . There being at present 50 states in the Union , there are currently 100 senators . From 1789 to 1913 , senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; they are now elected by popular vote , following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 . As the upper chamber of Congress , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it . These include the approval of treaties , and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , other federal executive officials and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president , the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . Furthermore , the Senate has the responsibility of conducting the trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .",

Article One , Section Three of the United States Constitution provides that the vice president of the United States is the president of the Senate ( despite not being a senator ) , and mandates that the Senate must choose a president pro tempore to act in the vice president 's absence . Unlike the vice president , the president pro tempore is an elected member of the Senate , able to speak or vote on any issue . Selected by the Senate at large , the president pro tempore has enjoyed many privileges and some limited powers . During the vice president 's absence , the president pro tempore is empowered to preside over Senate sessions . In practice , neither the vice president nor the president pro tempore usually presides ; instead , the duty of presiding officer is rotated among junior U.S. senators of the majority party to give them experience in parliamentary procedure . Since 1890 , the most senior U.S. senator in the majority party has generally been chosen to be president pro tempore and holds the office continuously until the election of another . This tradition has been observed without interruption since 1949 . Since the enactment of the current Presidential Succession Act in 1947 , the president pro tempore is third in the line of succession to the presidency , after the vice president and the speaker of the House of Representatives and ahead of the secretary of state .
