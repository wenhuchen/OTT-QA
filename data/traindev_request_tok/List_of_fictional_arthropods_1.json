  "/wiki/Fly": "True flies are insects of the order Diptera , the name being derived from the Greek \u03b4\u03b9- di- two , and \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd pteron wings . Insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly , the hindwings having evolved into advanced mechanosensory organs known as halteres , which act as high-speed sensors of rotational movement and allow dipterans to perform advanced aerobatics . Diptera is a large order containing an estimated 1,000,000 species including horse-flies , [ a ] crane flies , hoverflies and others , although only about 125,000 species have been described . Flies have a mobile head , with a pair of large compound eyes , and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking ( mosquitoes , black flies and robber flies ) , or for lapping and sucking in the other groups . Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight , and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces . Flies undergo complete metamorphosis ; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae , which lack true limbs , develop in a protected environment , often inside their food source . The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so ; flies mostly have short lives as adults . Diptera is one of the major insect orders and of considerable ecological and human importance . Flies are important pollinators , second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives . Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination . Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research , but less benignly , mosquitoes are vectors for malaria , dengue , West Nile fever , yellow fever , encephalitis , and other infectious diseases ; and houseflies , commensal with humans all over the world , spread food-borne illnesses . Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers , buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids .",

  "/wiki/Ant": "Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and , along with the related wasps and bees , belong to the order Hymenoptera . Ants appear suddenly across the globe during the earliest part of the Late Cretaceous , but are already considerably diversified by this time , suggesting an earlier origin . Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period , and diversified after the rise of flowering plants . More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified . They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists . Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals . Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile , wingless females , most of which are workers ( ergates ) , as well as soldiers ( dinergates ) and other specialised groups . Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called drones ( aner ) and one or more fertile females called queens ( gynes ) . The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity , collectively working together to support the colony .",

  "/wiki/Gnorm_Gnat": "Gnorm Gnat was an American gag-a-day comic strip by Jim Davis based on fictional insects , with the primary focus on a gnat named Gnorm . The strip appeared in The Pendleton Times in Pendleton , Indiana ( and would be the only newspaper to publish the strip ) from 1972 to 1975 , but failure to take the character to mainstream success led Davis to instead create the comic strip Garfield . Mike Peters , the cartoonist for Mother Goose and Grimm , has said that Gnorm Gnat is now a part of cartoon folklore as a failure that paved the way for major success .",
  "/wiki/Gnat": "A gnat /\u02c8n\u00e6t/ is any of many species of tiny flying insects in the dipterid suborder Nematocera , especially those in the families Mycetophilidae , Anisopodidae and Sciaridae . They can be both biting and non-biting . Most often they fly in large numbers , called clouds . Gnat is a loose descriptive category rather than a phylogenetic or other technical term , so there is no scientific consensus on what constitutes a gnat . Some entomologists consider only non-biting flies to be gnats . Certain universities also distinguish eye gnats : the Smithsonian Institution describes them as non-biting flies , no bigger than a few grains of salt , . attracted to fluids secreted by your eyes .",

  "/wiki/Bee": "Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants , known for their role in pollination and , in the case of the best-known bee species , the western honey bee , for producing honey and beeswax . Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade , called Anthophila . There are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families . They are found on every continent except Antarctica , in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants . Some species - including honey bees , bumblebees , and stingless bees - live socially in colonies . Bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen , the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients . Most pollen is used as food for larvae . Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially . The decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees . Bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species whose workers are less than 2 millimetres ( 0.08 in ) long , to Megachile pluto , the largest species of leafcutter bee , whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres ( 1.54 in ) . The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae , or sweat bees , but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies . Vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as bee-eaters ; insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies .",

  "/wiki/Flea": "Flea , the common name for the order Siphonaptera , includes 2,500 species of small flightless insects that survive as external parasites of mammals and birds . Fleas live by consuming blood , or hematophagy , from their hosts . Adult fleas grow to about 3 mm ( 0.12 in ) long , are usually brown , and have bodies that are flattened sideways or narrow , enabling them to move through their host 's fur or feathers . They lack wings , but have strong claws preventing them from being dislodged , mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood , and hind legs extremely well adapted for jumping . They are able to leap a distance of some 50 times their body length , a feat second only to jumps made by another group of insects , the superfamily of froghoppers . Flea larvae are worm-like with no limbs ; they have chewing mouthparts and feed on organic debris left on their host 's skin . The Siphonaptera are most closely related to the snow scorpionflies , or snow fleas in the UK , formally the Boreidae , placing them within the Endopterygote insect order Mecoptera . Fleas arose in the early Cretaceous , most likely as ectoparasites of mammals , before moving on to other groups , including birds . Each species of flea is more or less a specialist with respect to its host animal species : many species never breed on any other host , though some are less selective . Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group ; for example , the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos , the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats , and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews . The oriental rat flea , Xenopsylla cheopis , is a vector of Yersinia pestis , the bacterium which causes bubonic plague . The disease was spread to humans by rodents such as the black rat , which were bitten by infected fleas .",
  "/wiki/Cockroach": "Cockroaches are insects of the order Blattodea , which also includes termites . About 30 cockroach species out of 4,600 are associated with human habitats . About four species are well known as pests . The cockroaches are an ancient group , dating back at least as far as the Carboniferous period , some 320 million years ago . Those early ancestors however lacked the internal ovipositors of modern roaches . Cockroaches are somewhat generalized insects without special adaptations like the sucking mouthparts of aphids and other true bugs ; they have chewing mouthparts and are likely among the most primitive of living neopteran insects . They are common and hardy insects , and can tolerate a wide range of environments from Arctic cold to tropical heat . Tropical cockroaches are often much bigger than temperate species , and , contrary to popular belief , extinct cockroach relatives and 'roachoids ' such as the Carboniferous Archimylacris and the Permian Apthoroblattina were not as large as the biggest modern species . Some species , such as the gregarious German cockroach , have an elaborate social structure involving common shelter , social dependence , information transfer and kin recognition . Cockroaches have appeared in human culture since classical antiquity . They are popularly depicted as dirty pests , though the great majority of species are inoffensive and live in a wide range of habitats around the world .",
