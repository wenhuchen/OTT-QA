  "/wiki/War_of_the_Quadruple_Alliance": "The War of the Quadruple Alliance ( 1718-1720 ) was caused by Spanish attempts to recover territorial losses agreed by the 1713 Peace of Utrecht . Primarily conducted in Italy , it included minor engagements in the Americas and Northern Europe , as well as the Spanish-backed 1719 Jacobite Rising . Spain recaptured Sardinia in 1717 without opposition , followed by a landing on Sicily in July 1718 . This led to the Quadruple Alliance on 2 August 1718 , comprising Britain , France , Emperor Charles VI and the Dutch Republic . The war ended with the 1720 Treaty of The Hague ; this restored the position prior to 1717 but with Savoy and Austria exchanging Sardinia and Sicily . Spain regained the Kingdom of Naples during the 1733 to 1735 War of the Polish Succession .",
  "/wiki/Spanish_Empire": "The Spanish Empire ( Spanish : Imperio Espa\u00f1ol ; Latin : Imperium Hispanicum ) , historically known as the Hispanic Monarchy ( Spanish : Monarqu\u00eda Hisp\u00e1nica ) and as the Catholic Monarchy ( Spanish : Monarqu\u00eda Cat\u00f3lica ) , was one of the largest empires in history . From the late 15th century to the early 19th , Spain controlled a huge overseas territory in the New World , the Asian archipelago of the Philippines , what they called The Indies ( Spanish : Las Indias ) and territories in Europe , Africa and Oceania . It was one of the most powerful empires of the 16th and 17th centuries . The Spanish Empire became known as the empire on which the sun never sets and reached its maximum extension in the 18th century . Castile became the dominant kingdom in Iberia because of its jurisdiction over the overseas empire in the Americas and the Philippines . The structure of empire was established under the Spanish Habsburgs ( 1516-1700 ) , and under the Spanish Bourbon monarchs the empire was brought under greater crown control and increased its revenues from the Indies . The crown 's authority in The Indies was enlarged by the papal grant of powers of patronage , giving it power in the religious sphere . An important element in the formation of Spain 's empire was the dynastic union between Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon , known as the Catholic Monarchs , which initiated political , religious and social cohesion but not political unification . Iberian kingdoms retained their political identities , with particular administration and juridical configurations . Although the power of the Spanish sovereign as monarch varied from one territory to another , the monarch acted as such in a unitary manner over all the ruler 's territories through a system of councils : the unity did not mean uniformity . In 1580 , when Philip II of Spain succeeded to the throne of Portugal ( as Philip I ) , he established the Council of Portugal , which oversaw Portugal and its empire and preserv [ ed ] its own laws , institutions , and monetary system , and united only in sharing a common sovereign . The Iberian Union remained in place until in 1640 , when Portugal reestablished the independence under the House of Braganza .",
  "/wiki/Puebloans": "The Puebloans or Pueblo peoples , are Native Americans in the Southwestern United States who share common agricultural , material and religious practices . When Spaniards entered the area beginning in the 16th century , they came across complex , multi-story villages built of adobe , stone and other local materials , which they called pueblos , or villages , a term that later came to refer also to the peoples who live in these villages . There are currently 100 Pueblos that are still inhabited , among which Taos , San Ildefonso , Acoma , Zuni , and Hopi are the best-known . Pueblo communities are located in the present-day states of New Mexico , Arizona , and Texas , mostly along the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers and their tributaries . The term Anasazi is sometimes used to refer to Pueblo people but it is now largely dispreferred . Anasazi is a Navajo word that means Ancient Ones or Ancient Enemy , hence Pueblo peoples ' rejection of it ( see exonym ) . Puebloans speak languages from four different language families , and each Pueblo is further divided culturally by kinship systems and agricultural practices , although all cultivate varieties of maize . Despite increasing pressure from Spanish and later Anglo-American forces , Pueblo nations have maintained much of their traditional cultures , which center around agricultural practices , a tight-knit community revolving around family clans and respect for tradition . Puebloans have been remarkably adept at preserving their core religious beliefs all the while developing a syncretic approach to Catholicism . In the 21st century , some 35,000 Pueblo are estimated to live in New Mexico and Arizona .",

Distant cousins of the Apache are the Navajo , with which they share the Southern Athabaskan languages . There are Apache communities in Oklahoma , Texas , and reservations in Arizona and New Mexico . Apache people have moved throughout the United States and elsewhere , including urban centers . The Apache Nations are politically autonomous , speak several different languages and have distinct cultures . Historically , the Apache homelands have consisted of high mountains , sheltered and watered valleys , deep canyons , deserts , and the southern Great Plains , including areas in what is now Eastern Arizona , Northern Mexico ( Sonora and Chihuahua ) and New Mexico , West Texas , and Southern Colorado . These areas are collectively known as Apacheria . The Apache tribes fought the invading Spanish and Mexican peoples for centuries . The first Apache raids on Sonora appear to have taken place during the late 17th century .

Historically , the Pawnee lived in villages of earth lodges with adjacent farmlands near the Loup , Republican , and South Platte rivers . The Pawnee tribal economic activities throughout the year alternated between farming crops and hunting buffalo . In the early 18th century , the Pawnee numbered more than 60,000 people and were one of the largest and most powerful tribes in the west . Although dominating the Loup ( ickari\u02be ) and Platte ( k\u00edckatuus ) river areas for centuries , they later suffered from increasing encroachment and attrition by their numerically superior , nomadic enemies : the Sioux ( or Lakota ( p\u00e1hriksukat / paah\u00edksukat ) ( cut throat / cuts the throat ) , Cheyenne ( s\u00e1he / s\u00e1hi ) , and Arapaho ( s\u00e1ri\u02beitihka ) ( dog eater ) ; the Pawnee called these collectively as c\u00e1rarat ( enemy tribe ) or cahriksuupi\u00edru\u02be ( enemy ) . The Pawnee were occasionally at war with the Comanche ( raar\u00edhta\u02be ) and Kiowa ( k\u00e1\u02beiwa ) farther south . They had suffered many losses due to Eurasian infectious diseases brought by the expanding Europeans , and by 1860 , the Pawnee population was reduced to 4,000 . It further decreased , because of disease , crop failure , and warfare , to approximately 2,400 by 1873 , after which time the Pawnee were forced to move to Indian Territory in Oklahoma .

The Cheyenne comprise two Native American tribes , the S\u00f3'taeo ' o or S\u00f3'ta\u00e9taneo ' o ( more commonly spelled as Suhtai or Sutaio ) and the Ts\u00e9ts\u00eah\u00e9st\u00e2hese ( also spelled Tsitsistas ) .

Today , the Cheyenne people are split into two federally recognized Nations : the Southern Cheyenne , who are enrolled in the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Oklahoma , and the Northern Cheyenne , who are enrolled in the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana . At the time of their first contact with the Europeans , the Cheyenne were living in the area of what is now Minnesota . At times they have been allied with the Lakota and Arapaho , and at other points enemies of the Lakota . In the early 18th century they migrated west across the Mississippi River and into North and South Dakota , where they adopted the horse culture . Having settled the Black Hills of South Dakota and the Powder River Country of present-day Montana , they introduced the horse culture to Lakota bands about 1730 . Allied with the Arapaho , the Cheyenne pushed the Kiowa to the Southern Plains . In turn , they were pushed west by the more numerous Lakota . The Cheyenne Nation or Ts\u00eah\u00e9st\u00e1no was at one time composed of ten bands that spread across the Great Plains from southern Colorado to the Black Hills in South Dakota .

The term is an exonym created from a French transcription of the Anishinaabe term Nadouessioux , and can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation 's many language dialects . The modern Sioux consist of two major divisions based on language divisions : the Dakota and Lakota . Before the 17th century , the Santee Dakota ( Is\u00e1\u014byathi ; Knife also known as the Eastern Dakota ) lived around Lake Superior with territories in present-day northern Minnesota and Wisconsin . They gathered wild rice , hunted woodland animals and used canoes to fish . Wars with the Ojibwe throughout the 1700s pushed the Dakota into southern Minnesota , where the Western Dakota ( Yankton , Yanktonai ) and Teton ( Lakota ) were residing . In the 1800s , the Dakota signed treaties with the United States , ceding much of their land in Minnesota . Failure of the United States to make treaty payments on time , as well as low food supplies , led to the Dakota War of 1862 , which resulted in the Dakota being exiled from Minnesota to numerous reservations in Nebraska , North and South Dakota and Canada . After 1870 , the Dakota people began to return to Minnesota , creating the present-day reservations in the state .

The cause of the war was the desire of the U.S. government to obtain ownership of the Black Hills . Gold had been discovered in the Black Hills , settlers began to encroach onto Native American lands , and the Sioux and Cheyenne refused to cede ownership to the U.S . Traditionally , the United States military and historians place the Lakota at the center of the story , especially given their numbers , but some Indians believe the Cheyenne were the primary target of the U.S. campaign . Among the many battles and skirmishes of the war was the Battle of the Little Bighorn , often known as Custer 's Last Stand , the most storied of the many encounters between the U.S. army and mounted Plains Indians . That Indian victory notwithstanding , the U.S. leveraged national resources to force the Indians to surrender , primarily by attacking and destroying their encampments and property .
