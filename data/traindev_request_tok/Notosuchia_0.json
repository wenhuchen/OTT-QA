At 8.5 million square kilometers ( 3.2 million square miles ) and with over 211 million people , Brazil is the world 's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous . Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro . In 1815 , the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves .",

  "/wiki/Carnivore": "A carnivore /\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0rn\u026av\u0254\u02d0r/ , meaning meat eater ( Latin , caro , genitive carnis , meaning meat or flesh and vorare meaning to devour ) , is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue , whether through predation or scavenging . Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores . Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food , and , apart from the more general definition , there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore . A carnivore at the top of the food chain , not preyed upon by other animals , is termed an apex predator . Carnivore also may refer to the mammalian order Carnivora , but this is somewhat misleading : many , but not all , Carnivora are meat eaters , and even fewer are true obligate carnivores ( see below ) . For example , while the Arctic polar bear eats meat almost exclusively ( more than 90% of its diet is meat ) , most species of bears are omnivorous , and the giant panda is exclusively herbivorous . There are also many carnivorous species that are not members of Carnivora . The correct term for mammals in this group is carnivoran . Outside the animal kingdom , there are several genera containing carnivorous plants ( predominantly insectivores ) and several phyla containing carnivorous fungi ( preying mostly on microscopic invertebrates such as nematodes , amoebae and springtails ) .",

Many of the non-desert portions of the country are threatened by periodic drought and desertification . The economy is concentrated around subsistence , with some export agriculture in the more fertile south , and export of raw materials , especially uranium ore. Niger faces serious challenges to development due to its landlocked position , desert terrain , inefficient agriculture , high fertility rates without birth control , and the resulting overpopulation , the poor educational level and poverty of its people , lack of infrastructure , poor healthcare , and environmental degradation . Nigerien society reflects a diversity drawn from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and regions and their relatively short period living in a single state .

At 592,800 square kilometres ( 228,900 sq mi ) Madagascar is the world 's 2nd largest island country . The nation comprises the island of Madagascar ( the fourth- largest island in the world ) and numerous smaller peripheral islands . Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana , Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 million years ago , allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation . Consequently , Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot ; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth . The island 's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats . The archaeological evidence of the earliest human foraging on Madagascar may date up to 10,000 years ago . Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and 550 AD by Indianized Austronesian peoples , arriving on outrigger canoes from Indonesia . The social and religious situation of Indonesia during those times were that of Hinduism and Buddhism , along with native Indonesian culture . These were joined around the 9th century AD by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa . Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time , each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life . The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more subgroups , of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands .",

  "/wiki/Hypercarnivore": "A hypercarnivore is an animal which has a diet that is more than 70% meat , with the difference consisting of non-animal foods such as fungi , fruits or other plant material . Some extant examples include crocodilians , owls , shrikes , eagles , vultures , felids , most wild canids , dolphins , orcas , snakes , spiders , scorpions , mantises , marlins , groupers , and most sharks . Every species in the family Felidae , including the domesticated cat , is a hypercarnivore in its natural state . Additionally , this term is also used in paleobiology to describe taxa of animals which have an increased slicing component of their dentition relative to the grinding component . Hypercarnivores per definition need not be apex predators . For example , salmon are exclusively carnivorous , yet they are prey at all stages of life for a variety of organisms . Many prehistoric mammals of the clade Carnivoramorpha ( Carnivora and Miacoidea without Creodonta ) , along with the early order Creodonta , and some mammals of the even earlier order Cimolesta , were hypercarnivores . The earliest carnivorous mammal is considered to be Cimolestes , which existed during the Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene periods in North America about 66 million years ago . Theropod dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus rex that existed during the late Cretaceous , although not mammals , were obligate carnivores . Large hypercarnivores evolved frequently in the fossil record , often in response to an ecological opportunity afforded by the decline or extinction of previously dominant hypercarnivorous taxa . While the evolution of large size and carnivory may be favored at the individual level , it can lead to a macroevolutionary decline , wherein such extreme dietary specialization results in reduced population densities and a greater vulnerability for extinction . As a result of these opposing forces , the fossil record of carnivores is dominated by successive clades of hypercarnivores that diversify and decline , only to be replaced by new hypercarnivorous clades .",

Its coast in the south is located on the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean . The federation comprises 36 states and 1 Federal Capital Territory , where the capital , Abuja , is located . The constitution defines Nigeria as a democratic secular state. , Nigeria has been home to a number of ancient and indigenous kingdoms and states over the millennia . The modern state originated from British colonial rule beginning in the 19th century , and took its present territorial shape with the merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914 by Lord Fredrick Lugard . The British set up administrative and legal structures while practicing indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms , Nigeria became a formally independent federation in 1960 . It experienced a civil war from 1967 to 1970 . It thereafter alternated between democratically elected civilian governments and military dictatorships until it achieved a stable democracy in 1999 , with the 2011 presidential election considered the first to be reasonably free and fair . Nigeria is often referred to as the Giant of Africa , owing to its large population and economy . With 206 million inhabitants , Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world . Nigeria has the third-largest youth population in the world , after India and China , with more than 90 million of its population under the age of eighteen . Nigeria is the world 's 20th largest economy as of 2015 [ update ] , worth more than $ 500 billion and $ 1 trillion in terms of nominal GDP and purchasing power parity , respectively .",

It was described in 1997 by Elizabeth Gomani as a member of the family Notosuchidae . The type species is M. mwakasyungutiensis , referring to Mwakasyunguti , the area of northern Malawi where it was found . It was classified as a member of the family Itasuchidae by Carvalho and colleagues in 2004 . Malawisuchus was first discovered in 1989 , but not formally described for several years . It had unusual , mammal-like teeth , including teeth with multiple cusps in the rear of the jaw . Its jaw joint suggests it processed food with a forward motion . The neck was strong , and the articulations of the hind leg suggest an upright posture and an ability to run , while the muscle attachments on the upper arm suggest digging ; additionally , the taphonomy of articulated specimens suggests that they had been preserved in burrows . It was a small crocodilian , only about 60 centimetres long ( 24 in ) .",

It is bordered by Zambia to the west , Tanzania to the north and northeast , and Mozambique surrounding on the east , south and southwest . Malawi spans over 118,484 km2 ( 45,747 sq mi ) and has an estimated population of 18,143,217 ( as of July 2018 ) . Lake Malawi takes up about a third of Malawi 's area . Its capital is Lilongwe , which is also Malawi 's largest city ; the second largest is Blantyre , the third largest is Mzuzu and the fourth largest is its old capital Zomba . The name Malawi comes from the Maravi , an old name of the Nyanja people that inhabit the area . The country is nicknamed The Warm Heart of Africa because of the friendliness of the people . The part of Africa now known as Malawi was settled by migrating Bantu groups around the 10th century . Centuries later in 1891 the area was colonised by the British . In 1953 Malawi , then known as Nyasaland , a protectorate of the United Kingdom , became a protectorate within the semi-independent Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland . The Federation was dissolved in 1963 . In 1964 the protectorate over Nyasaland was ended and Nyasaland became an independent country under Queen Elizabeth II with the new name Malawi .",

Morrinhosuchus refers to Morrinho de Santa Luzia , a hill nearby the collection site of the holotype , while luziae refers to the chapel of Santa Luzia , which is located on top of the hill . The skull and jaws are posteriorly broad but narrow significantly toward the front . The teeth at the back of the jaw are bulbous in shape and circular in cross-section ( this shape is only found in one other notosuchian , Mariliasuchus , also from the Adamantina Formation ) . The mandible arches upward . The symphysis , or area where the two sides of the lower jaw meet , is formed mostly by the mandibles but also partly by the splenials . The skull preserves an antorbital fenestra , or opening in front of the eyes . The nasal , a bone at the top of the skull behind the nostrils , is relatively long . There is also a small notch at the contact between the premaxilla and the maxilla near the front of the snout . Morrinhosuchus can be distinguished from Mariliasuchus on the basis of several unique features . For example , there is a gap between the maxilla and the palatine bone around the midline of the palate .",

It was terrestrial , living approximately 85 million years ago in the Coniacian or Santonian stages of the Late Cretaceous . Notosuchus was relatively small , reaching 1.5 m ( 4.9 ft ) in length and a weight of 36 kg ( 79 lb ) . Remains have been found in the Bajo de la Carpa Formation in Patagonia , Argentina . First named in 1896 , Notosuchus was the first known notosuchian . The type species is N. terrestris . A second species , N. lepidus , was named in 1957 . A paper published in 2008 by Fiorelli and Calvo described new remains of the type species N. terrestris . In it , the authors suggested that the skull would have supported a short trunk , or hog 's snout as well as fleshy upper and lower lips . The anteriorly directed nares and the absence of a bony nasal septum ( which presumably indicates cartilaginous tissue serving its place ) provide evidence for a trunk-like snout , while striations on the surface of the nasal bones and the lower jaw most likely acted as attachment points for the nasolabial muscles and the depressor muscle , respectively . Additionally , the authors suggested that a lateral rim on the dentary as well as numerous aligned neurovascular foramina are evidence of soft cheek-like muscular tissue . The function of the trunk was likely used for searching for food by sniffing the ground in a manner similar to extant suids and peccaries , while the cheeks would aid in mastication by preventing food loss .",

Mount Kilimanjaro , Africa 's highest mountain , is in northeastern Tanzania . Many important hominid fossils have been found in Tanzania , such as 6-million-year-old Pliocene hominid fossils . The genus Australopithecus ranged all over Africa 4 to 2 million years ago ; and the oldest remains of the genus Homo are found near Lake Olduvai . Following the rise of Homo erectus 1.8 million years ago , humanity spread all over the Old World , and later in the New World and Australia under the species Homo sapiens . Homo sapiens also overtook Africa and absorbed the older archaic species and subspecies of humanity . One of the oldest known ethnic groups still existing , the Hadzabe , appears to have originated in Tanzania , and their oral history recalls ancestors who were tall and were the first to use fire , medicine , and lived in caves , much like Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis who lived in the same region before them . Later in the Stone and Bronze Age , prehistoric migrations into Tanzania included Southern Cushitic speakers who moved south from present-day Ethiopia ; Eastern Cushitic people who moved into Tanzania from north of Lake Turkana about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago ; and the Southern Nilotes , including the Datoog , who originated from the present-day South Sudan-Ethiopia border region between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago . : page 18 These movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of the Mashariki Bantu from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas .

  "/wiki/Omnivore": "An omnivore ( /\u02c8\u0252mn\u026av\u0254\u02d0r/ ) is an animal that has the ability to eat and survive on both plant and animal matter . Obtaining energy and nutrients from plant and animal matter , omnivores digest carbohydrates , protein , fat , and fiber , and metabolize the nutrients and energy of the sources absorbed . Often , they have the ability to incorporate food sources such as algae , fungi , and bacteria into their diet . Omnivores come from diverse backgrounds that often independently evolved sophisticated consumption capabilities . For instance , dogs evolved from primarily carnivorous organisms ( Carnivora ) while pigs evolved from primarily herbivorous organisms ( Artiodactyla ) . Despite this , physical characteristics such as tooth morphology may be reliable indicators of diet in mammals , with such morphological adaptation having been observed in bears . The variety of different animals that are classified as omnivores can be placed into further sub-categories depending on their feeding behaviors . Frugivores include maned wolves and orangutans ; insectivores include swallows and pink fairy armadillos ; granivores include large ground finches and mice . All of these animals are omnivores , yet still fall into special niches in terms of feeding behavior and preferred foods . Being omnivores gives these animals more food security in stressful times or makes possible living in less consistent environments ."
