  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sardinia": "The Kingdom of Sardinia [ nb 1 ] was a state in Southern Europe from the early 14th until the mid-19th century . The Kingdom was a member of the Council of Aragon and initially consisted of the islands of Corsica and Sardinia , sovereignty over both of which was claimed by the Papacy , which granted them as a fief , the regnum Sardiniae et Corsicae ( kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica ) , to King James II of Aragon in 1297 . Beginning in 1324 , James and his successors conquered the island of Sardinia and established de facto their de jure authority . In 1420 , after the Sardinian-Catalan War , the last competing claim to the island was bought out . After the union of the crowns of Aragon and Castile , Sardinia became a part of the burgeoning Spanish Empire . In 1720 , the island was ceded by the Habsburg and Bourbon claimants to the Spanish throne to the Duke of Savoy Victor Amadeus II . The Savoyards united it with their historical possessions on the Italian mainland , and the Kingdom came to be progressively identified with the Mainland states , which included , besides Savoy and Aosta , dynastic possessions like the Principality of Piedmont and the County of Nice ( over both of which the Savoyards had been exercising their control since the 13th century and 1388 , respectively ) . The formal name of such composite state was the States of His Majesty the King of Sardinia and is referenced to as either Savoy-Sardinia , Piedmont-Sardinia , or even the Kingdom of Piedmont to emphasise that the island of Sardinia had always been of secondary importance to the monarchy . While in theory the traditional capital of the island of Sardinia and the seat of its viceroys had always been Cagliari , it was the Piedmontese city of Turin , the capital of Savoy since the mid 16th century , the de facto chosen seat of power under Savoyard rule . When the Mainland domains of the House of Savoy were occupied and eventually annexed by Napoleonic France , the king of Sardinia temporarily resided on the island for the first time in Sardinia 's history under Savoyard rule . The Congress of Vienna ( 1814-15 ) , which restructured Europe after Napoleon 's defeat , returned to Savoy its Mainland possessions and augmented them with Liguria , taken from the Republic of Genoa . In 1847-48 , through an act of Union analogous to the Irish-British one , the various Savoyard states were unified under one legal system with their capital in Turin , and granted a constitution , the Statuto Albertino .",

In the context of a larger agreement between Napoleonic France and Spain , the Bourbons of Parma were compensated for the loss of their territory in northern Italy ( which had been occupied by French troops since 1796 ) .

Known as la Superba ( the Superb one ) , la Dominante ( The Dominant one ) , la Dominante dei mari ( the Dominant of the Seas ) , and la Repubblica dei magnifici ( the Republic of the Magnificents ) , during the late Middle Ages Genoa was one of the main commercial powers of the Mediterranean Sea , while between the 16th and 17th centuries it was one of the major financial centers in Europe . It was a celebrated maritime republic and today its coat of arms is depicted in the flag of the Italian Navy . In 1284 , Genoa fought victoriously against the Republic of Pisa in the battle of Meloria for the dominance over the Tyrrhenian Sea , and it was an eternal rival of Venice for dominance in the Mediterranean Sea . The republic began when Genoa became a self-governing commune within the imperial Kingdom of Italy , and ended when it was conquered by the French First Republic under Napoleon and replaced with the Ligurian Republic . Corsica was ceded to France in the Treaty of Versailles of 1768 . The Ligurian Republic was annexed by the First French Empire in 1805 ; its restoration was briefly proclaimed in 1814 following the defeat of Napoleon , but it was ultimately annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1815 .",

The Italian Social Republic was the second and last incarnation of the Italian Fascist state and was led by Duce Benito Mussolini and his reformed anti-monarchist Republican Fascist Party which tried to modernise and revise fascist doctrine into a more moderate and sophisticated direction . The state declared Rome its capital , but was de facto centered on Sal\u00f2 ( hence its colloquial name ) , a small town on Lake Garda , near Brescia , where Mussolini and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were headquartered . The Italian Social Republic exercised nominal sovereignty in Northern and Central Italy , but was largely dependent on German troops to maintain control . In July 1943 , after the Allies had pushed Italy out of North Africa and subsequently invaded Sicily , the Grand Fascist Council - with the support of King Victor Emmanuel III - overthrew and arrested Mussolini . The new government began secret peace negotiations with the Allied powers . When the Armistice of Cassibile was announced 8 September , Germany was prepared and quickly intervened . Germany seized control of the northern half of Italy , freed Mussolini and brought him to the German-occupied area to establish a satellite regime . The Italian Social Republic was proclaimed on 23 September 1943 .

  "/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy": "The Kingdom of Italy ( Italian : Regno d'Italia ) was a state which existed from 1861 - when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy - until 1946 - when civil discontent led an institutional referendum to abandon the monarchy and form the modern Italian Republic . The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia , which can be considered its legal predecessor state . Italy declared war on Austria in alliance with Prussia in 1866 and received the region of Veneto following their victory . Italian troops entered Rome in 1870 , thereby ending more than one thousand years of Papal temporal power . Italy entered into a Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1882 , following strong disagreements with France about the respective colonial expansions . However , even if relations with Berlin became very friendly , the alliance with Vienna remained purely formal as the Italians were keen to acquire Trentino and Trieste , corners of Austria-Hungary populated by Italians . So during World War I , Italy accepted the British invitation to join the Allied Powers , as the western powers promised territorial compensation ( at the expense of Austria-Hungary ) for participation that was more generous than Vienna 's offer in exchange for Italian neutrality . Victory in the war gave Italy a permanent seat in the Council of the League of Nations . Fascist Italy is the era of National Fascist Party government from 1922 to 1943 with Benito Mussolini as head of government . The fascists imposed totalitarian rule and crushed the political and intellectual opposition , while promoting economic modernization , traditional social values and a rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church . According to Payne ( 1996 ) , [ the ] Fascist government passed through several relatively distinct phases . The first phase ( 1923-1925 ) was nominally a continuation of the parliamentary system , albeit with a legally-organized executive dictatorship ."
