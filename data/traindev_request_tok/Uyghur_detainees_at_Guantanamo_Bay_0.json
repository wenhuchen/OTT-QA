The country contains approximately 340 islands , and together with parts of the Federated States of Micronesia , forms the western chain of the Caroline Islands . Its area is 466 square kilometers ( 180 sq mi ) . The most populous island is Koror . The capital Ngerulmud is located on the nearby island of Babeldaob , in Melekeok State . Palau shares maritime boundaries with the Philippines , Indonesia , and Micronesia . The country was originally settled approximately 3,000 years ago by migrants from Insular Southeast Asia . The islands were first explored by Europeans in the 16th century , and were made part of the Spanish East Indies in 1574 . Following Spain 's defeat in the Spanish-American War in 1898 , the islands were sold to Imperial Germany in 1899 under the terms of the German-Spanish Treaty , where they were administered as part of German New Guinea . After World War I , the islands were made a part of the Japanese-ruled South Seas Mandate by the League of Nations . During World War II , skirmishes , including the major Battle of Peleliu , were fought between American and Japanese troops as part of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign . Along with other Pacific Islands , Palau was made a part of the United States-governed Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands in 1947 .",

Hundreds of men , including many non-Afghans , surrendered near Kunduz and were being held as enemy combatants at Qala-i-Jangi fortress by the Afghan Northern Alliance ( United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan ) forces for an interrogation by the American Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) personnel interested in al-Qaeda suspects . The prisoners violently revolted and the ensuing fighting escalated into one of the bloodiest engagements of the conflict . It took Northern Alliance fighters , assisted by British and American special forces and air support , six days to quell the revolt . All but 86 prisoners were killed as well as a number of Northern Alliance fighters .

[ note 1 ] Switzerland is a landlocked country bordered by Italy to the south , France to the west , Germany to the north , and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east . It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau , the Alps , and the Jura , spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 ( 15,940 sq mi ) , and land area of 39,997 km2 ( 15,443 sq mi ) . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory , the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau , where the largest cities are located , among them the two global cities and economic centres of Z\u00fcrich and Geneva . The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period , resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy . Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day . Since the Reformation of the 16th century , Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality ; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002 . Nevertheless , it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world . Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross , one of the world 's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations , and is home to numerous international organisations , including the second largest UN office .

It is bordered on the northeast by Honduras , on the northwest by Guatemala , and on the south by the Pacific Ocean . El Salvador 's capital and largest city is San Salvador . As of 2018 [ update ] , the country had a population of approximately 6.42 million . El Salvador was for centuries inhabited by several Mesoamerican nations , especially the Cuzcatlecs , as well as the Lenca and Maya . In the early 16th century , the Spanish Empire conquered the territory , incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of New Spain ruled from Mexico City . However the Viceroyalty of Mexico had little or no influence in the daily affairs of the Central American isthmus , which would be colonized in 1524 . In 1609 the area became the Captaincy General of Guatemala , from which El Salvador was part of until its independence from Spain , which took place in 1821 , as part of the First Mexican Empire , then further seceded , as part of the Federal Republic of Central America , in 1823 . When the Republic dissolved in 1841 , El Salvador became a sovereign nation , then formed a short-lived union with Honduras and Nicaragua called the Greater Republic of Central America , which lasted from 1895 to 1898 . From the late 19th to the mid-20th century , El Salvador endured chronic political and economic instability characterized by coups , revolts , and a succession of authoritarian rulers . Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest culminated in the devastating Salvadoran Civil War ( 1979-1992 ) , which was fought between the military-led government and a coalition of left-wing guerrilla groups .

Denbeaux states that In the region , the term guest house refers simply to a form of travel accommodation and Stopping at such facilities is common for all people traveling in the area . A response to that report written by West Point 's Combating Terrorism Center argued that the Seton Hall report inaccurately defines the term safe-house - a well-known tool leveraged by criminals and terrorists to facilitate discreet movement of associates - as an innocuous residence used by American tourists and travel agencies . Denbeaux responded that the Seton Hall study had used the Department of Defenses terms objectively and accepted their plain meanings and that West Point does not provide any basis for equating guest houses and safe houses other than the obvious problem with detaining an individual in part based on his stay in a 'guest ' house .

  "/wiki/Administrative_Review_Board": "The Administrative Review Board is a United States military body that conducts an annual review of the detainees held by the United States in Camp Delta in the United States Navy base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . The purpose of the Board is to review whether the detainees still represent a threat . American President George W. Bush initially called the detainees illegal combatants . But , without a formal announcement of the policy change , the Bush Presidency changed their description to enemy combatant . From July 2004 through March 2005 , military authorities conducted a one-time Combatant Status Review Tribunal for each detainee , to confirm whether they had been properly been classified as an enemy combatant . The Combatant Status Reviews were criticized by human rights workers because the detainees were not entitled to legal counsel , and did not know what allegations they had to defend themselves against , and the detainees had no presumption of innocence . The ARB was created in an attempt to mitigate the harsh results of potentially indefinite detention by allowing an annual review to determine whether the enemy combatant should still be detained . The Combatant Status Reviews determined that 38 detainees were not illegal combatants after all . They determined that the rest of the detainees had been correctly classified as enemy combatants during their original , secret , classifications . The first set of Administrative Reviews took place between December 14 , 2004 and December 23 , 2005 . The Boards met to consider the cases of al 463 eligible detainees . They recommended the release of 14 detainees , and the repatriation of 120 detainees to the custody of the authorities in their home countries .",

The writ of habeas corpus is known as the great and efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement . [ Note 1 ] It is a summons with the force of a court order ; it is addressed to the custodian ( a prison official , for example ) and demands that a prisoner be brought before the court , and that the custodian present proof of authority , allowing the court to determine whether the custodian has lawful authority to detain the prisoner . If the custodian is acting beyond their authority , then the prisoner must be released . Any prisoner , or another person acting on their behalf , may petition the court , or a judge , for a writ of habeas corpus . One reason for the writ to be sought by a person other than the prisoner is that the detainee might be held incommunicado . Most civil law jurisdictions provide a similar remedy for those unlawfully detained , but this is not always called habeas corpus . For example , in some Spanish-speaking nations , the equivalent remedy for unlawful imprisonment is the amparo de libertad ( protection of freedom ) . Habeas corpus has certain limitations . Though a writ of right , it is not a writ of course . [ clarification needed ] [ Note 2 ] It is technically only a procedural remedy ; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law , but it does not necessarily protect other rights , such as the entitlement to a fair trial . So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law , then habeas corpus may not be a useful remedy .",

Slovakia 's territory spans about 49,000 square kilometres ( 19,000 sq mi ) and is mostly mountainous . The population is over 5.6 million and consists mostly of Slovaks . The capital and largest city is Bratislava , and the second-largest city is Ko\u0161ice . The official language is Slovak . The Slavs arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries . In the 7th century they played a significant role in the creation of Samo 's Empire and in the 9th century established the Principality of Nitra , which was later conquered by the Principality of Moravia to establish Great Moravia . In the 10th century , after the dissolution of Great Moravia , the territory was integrated into the Principality of Hungary , which would become the Kingdom of Hungary in 1000 . In 1241 and 1242 , much of the territory was destroyed by the Mongols during their invasion of Central and Eastern Europe . The area was recovered largely thanks to B\u00e9la IV of Hungary who also settled Germans who became an important ethnic group in the area , especially in what are today parts of central and eastern Slovakia . After World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , the Czechoslovak National Council established Czechoslovakia ( 1918-1939 ) .",
  "/wiki/American_aerial_bombardment_of_Afghanistan": "The War in Afghanistan ( also called the US War in Afghanistan , Afghanistan War , or Fourth Anglo-Afghan War ) , code named Operation Enduring Freedom ( 2001-14 ) and Operation Freedom 's Sentinel ( 2015-present ) , following the United States invasion of Afghanistan of 7 October 2001 , when the United States of America and its allies successfully drove the Taliban from power in order to deny al-Qaeda a safe base of operations in Afghanistan . Since the initial objectives were completed , a coalition of over 40 countries ( including all NATO members ) formed a security mission in the country . The war has since mostly involved US and allied Afghan government troops battling Taliban insurgents . The war in Afghanistan is the longest war in US history . Following the September 11 attacks in 2001 on the US , which President George W. Bush blamed on Osama bin Laden who was living or hiding in Afghanistan and had already been wanted since 1998 , President Bush demanded that the Taliban , who were de facto ruling the country , hand over bin Laden . The Taliban declined to extradite him unless they were provided clear evidence of his involvement in the attacks , which the US refused to provide and dismissed as a delaying tactic and then on 7 October 2001 launched Operation Enduring Freedom with the United Kingdom . To justify the War , the Bush administration claimed that Afghanistan only had selective sovereignty , and that intervention was necessary because the Taliban threatened the sovereignty of other states . The two were later joined by other forces , including the Northern Alliance - the Afghan opposition which had been fighting the Taliban in the ongoing civil war since 1996 . By December 2001 , the Taliban and their al-Qaeda allies were mostly defeated in the country , and at the Bonn Conference new Afghan interim authorities ( mostly from the Northern Alliance ) elected Hamid Karzai to head the Afghan Interim Administration . The United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) to assist the new authority with securing Kabul , which after a 2002 loya jirga ( grand assembly ) became the Afghan Transitional Administration . A nationwide rebuilding effort was also made following the end of the totalitarian Taliban regime . In the popular elections of 2004 , Karzai was elected president of the country , now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan .",

Lahore reached the height of its splendour under the Mughal Empire between the late 16th and early 18th century , and served as its capital city for a number of years . The city was captured by the forces of the Afsharid ruler Nader Shah in 1739 , and fell into a period of decay while being contested between the Afghans and the Sikhs . Lahore eventually became capital of the Sikh Empire in the early 19th century , and regained much of its lost grandeur . Lahore was then annexed to the British Empire , and made capital of British Punjab . Lahore was central to the independence movements of both India and Pakistan , with the city being the site of both the declaration of Indian Independence , and the resolution calling for the establishment of Pakistan . Lahore experienced some of the worst rioting during the Partition period preceding Pakistan 's independence .",
