In 1996 , he became the Mariners ' starting shortstop , won the major league batting championship , and finished second in voting for the AL MVP Award . His combination of power , speed , and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise , but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers .

The game-winning hit in Game 5 , in which Edgar Mart\u00ednez drove home Ken Griffey Jr. to win the game in the 11th inning , clinched a series win for the Mariners , served as a powerful impetus to preserve baseball in Seattle , and has since become an iconic moment in team history .
