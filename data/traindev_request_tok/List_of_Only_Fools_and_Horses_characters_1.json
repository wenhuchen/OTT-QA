Damien is the only child of Del and Raquel and nephew of Rodney Trotter . A recurring theme in the show was Rodney 's fixated belief that Damien was literally the Antichrist ( an allusion to the Damien Thorn character from the Omen series of films ) despite the fact that Damien shows no resentment nor intentions of harm toward anybody except Rodney himself . Del and Raquel chide Rodney for his mad obsessions and believe Damien to be a perfect angel , spoiling him frequently . From the earliest ages , Damien shows signs of being a spoiled brat , such as throwing things at Rodney , throwing seeds on the floor , deliberately waking Uncle Albert up from a nap , placing Cassandra 's birth control pills inside an urn containing Albert 's ashes , urinating in a public swimming pool ( from the top of the diving board ) , encouraging his father to physically fight someone at a funeral , and even hoping that his father might get sent to prison merely to fit in with his group of friends with imprisoned fathers . Although Del and Raquel seemed to remain oblivious to Damien 's bad behaviour when he was younger , they did gradually become stricter with him in the final episodes and Rodney frequently calls him or refers to him as Rat Boy . He was named after Del and Raquel could not decide on a name for their unborn baby ( Raquel thought of Aron , pronounced air-on , but Uncle Albert thought the kids would nickname him Aron a G-string and Del thought Troy , but the name Troy Trotter was instantly dismissed ) , so Rodney sarcastically suggested that they name him Damien as Rodney was convinced that the baby would be born half-demon . To his horror , they adored the name and Rodney desperately tried to get them to change their minds , offering the name Derek which led to his middle name ( and resulting in the initials D. D. T. ) Damien was born under a full moon and during the birth , Rodney even went as so far as to ask Del if the baby had been born with the numbers 666 branded on its forehead . After Damien was born , Rodney refused to hold him or share a room with him . In episodes when Damien was a child , Rodney seemed more relaxed around him but his fear arose again when Damien became a handsome and popular teenager who delighted in tormenting Rodney . Sometimes it became somewhat apparent that Del Boy enjoyed Rodney 's fear of Damien , and on Rodney 's birthday once , Damien sent him a card with the Devil on it .",
