Kandahar is located in the south of the country on the Arghandab River , at an elevation of 1,010 m ( 3,310 ft ) . It is the capital of Kandahar Province , and also the center of the larger cultural region called Loy Kandahar . In 1709 , Mirwais Hotak made the region an independent kingdom and turned Kandahar into the capital of the Hotak dynasty . In 1747 , Ahmad Shah Durrani , founder of the Durrani dynasty , made Kandahar the capital of the Afghan Empire . Kandahar is one of the most culturally significant cities of the Pashtuns and has been their traditional seat of power for more than 300 years . It is a major trading center for sheep , wool , cotton , silk , felt , food grains , fresh and dried fruit , and tobacco . The region produces fine fruits , especially pomegranates and grapes , and the city has plants for canning , drying , and packing fruit , and is a major source of marijuana and hashish en route to Tajikistan . The region around Kandahar is one of the oldest known human settlements . A major fortified city existed at the site of Kandahar , probably as early as c. 1000-750 BCE , and it became an important outpost of the Achaemenid ( Persian ) Empire in the 6th century BCE . Alexander the Great had laid-out the foundation of what is now Old Kandahar in the 4th century BC and gave it the Ancient Greek name \u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 A\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 ( Alexandria of Arachosia ) .

At its maximum extent , the empire ruled over what are now the modern-day countries of Afghanistan and Pakistan , as well as some parts of northeastern Iran , eastern Turkmenistan , and northwestern India . After the death of Nader Shah in 1747 , the region of Kandahar was claimed by Ahmad Shah Durrani . From there he began conquering Ghazni followed by Kabul . In 1749 the Mughal ruler had ceded sovereignty over much of north-west India to the Afghans . Ahmad Shah then set out westward to take possession of Herat , which was ruled by Shahrokh Shah . He next sent an army to subdue the areas north of the Hindu Kush and in short order all the different tribes began joining his cause . Ahmad Shah and his forces invaded India four times , taking control of Kashmir and the Punjab region . Early in 1757 , he sacked Delhi , but permitted the Mughal dynasty to remain in nominal control as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad Shah 's suzerainty over the Punjab , Sindh , and Kashmir . After the death of Ahmad Shah in about 1772 , his son Timur Shah became the next ruler of the Durrani dynasty who decided to make Kabul the new capital of the empire , and used Peshawar as the winter capital . The Durrani Empire is considered the foundation of the modern state of Afghanistan , with Ahmad Shah Durrani being credited as Father of the Nation .",

Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south ; [ b ] Iran to the west ; Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Tajikistan to the north ; and China to the northeast . Occupying 652,000 square kilometers ( 252,000 sq mi ) , it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest . Kabul is the capital and largest city . The population is 32 million , mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns , Tajiks , Hazaras and Uzbeks . Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era , and the country 's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia . The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by Alexander the Great , Mauryas , Muslim Arabs , Mongols , British , Soviets , and by the United States with allied countries . The land also served as the source from which the Kushans , Hephthalites , Samanids , Saffarids , Ghaznavids , Ghorids , Khaljis , Mughals , Hotaks , Durranis , and others have risen to form major empires . The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century . In the late 19th century , Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between British India and the Russian Empire . Its border with British India , the Durand Line , was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter 's independence in 1947 . Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence , eventually becoming a monarchy under Amanullah Khan , until almost 50 years later when Zahir Shah was overthrown and a republic was established .",

There is evidence of human activity in the area of the city from the late Paleolithic era , though there is no direct evidence of when Samarkand was founded ; some theories propose that it was founded between the 8th and 7th centuries B.C . Prospering from its location on the Silk Road between China and the Mediterranean , at times Samarkand was one of the greatest cities of Central Asia . By the time of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia , it was the capital of the Sogdian satrapy . The city was taken by Alexander the Great in 329 BC , when it was known by its Greek name of Marakanda ( \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1 ) . The city was ruled by a succession of Iranian and Turkic rulers until the Mongols under Genghis Khan conquered Samarkand in 1220 . Today , Samarkand is the capital of Samarqand Region and one of the largest cities of Uzbekistan . The city is noted for being an Islamic center for scholarly study . In the 14th century it became the capital of the empire of Timur ( Tamerlane ) and is the site of his mausoleum ( the Gur-e Amir ) . The Bibi-Khanym Mosque , rebuilt during the Soviet era , remains one of the city 's most notable landmarks . Samarkand 's Registan square was the ancient centre of the city , and is bound by three monumental religious buildings . The city has carefully preserved the traditions of ancient crafts : embroidery , gold embroidery , silk weaving , engraving on copper , ceramics , carving and painting on wood .",

The empire was founded by Timur ( also known as Tamerlane ) , a warlord of Turco-Mongol lineage , who established the empire between 1370 and his death in 1405 . He envisioned himself as the great restorer of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan , regarded himself as Genghis 's heir , and associated much with the Borjigin . Indeed Timur continued vigorous trade relations with Ming China and the Golden Horde , with Chinese diplomats like Ma Huan and Chen Cheng regularly traveling west to Samarkand to collect tribute and sell goods , continuing Mongol empire tradition . In 1467 , the ruling Timurid dynasty , or Timurids , lost most of Persia to Azerbaijanis and the Aq Qoyunlu confederation . But members of the Timurid dynasty continued to rule smaller states , sometimes known as Timurid emirates , in Central Asia and parts of India . In the 16th century , Babur , a Timurid prince from Ferghana ( modern Uzbekistan ) , invaded Kabulistan ( modern Afghanistan ) and established a small kingdom there , and from there 20 years later he invaded India to establish the Mughal Empire . Babur also claimed descent from Genghis Khan .",

Along with Liechtenstein , it is one of the world 's only two doubly landlocked countries . As a sovereign state , Uzbekistan is a secular , unitary constitutional republic . It comprises 12 provinces and one autonomous republic . The capital and largest city of Uzbekistan is Tashkent . What is now Uzbekistan was in ancient times part of the Iranian-speaking region of Transoxiana and Turan . The first recorded settlers were Eastern Iranian nomads , known as Scythians , who founded kingdoms in Khwarezm ( 8th-6th centuries BC ) , Bactria ( 8th-6th centuries BC ) , Sogdia ( 8th-6th centuries BC ) , Fergana ( 3rd century BC - 6th century AD ) , and Margiana ( 3rd century BC - 6th century AD ) . The area was incorporated into the Iranian Achaemenid Empire and , after a period of Macedonian Greek rule , was ruled by the Iranian Parthian Empire and later by the Sasanian Empire , until the Arab conquest of Iran in the 7th century . The Muslim conquest in the 7th century converted the majority of the population , including the local ruling classes , into adherents of Islam . During this period , cities such as Samarkand , Khiva and Bukhara began to grow rich from the Silk Road . The local Khwarezmian dynasty , and Central Asia as a whole , were decimated by the Mongol invasion in the 13th century .",

Its capital and largest city is Bishkek . Kyrgyzstan 's recorded history spans over 2,000 years , encompassing a variety of cultures and empires . Although geographically isolated by its highly mountainous terrain , which has helped preserve its ancient culture , Kyrgyzstan has been at the crossroads of several great civilizations as part of the Silk Road and other commercial and cultural routes . Though long inhabited by a succession of independent tribes and clans , Kyrgyzstan has periodically fallen under foreign domination and attained sovereignty as a nation-state only after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 . Since independence , the sovereign state has officially been a unitary parliamentary republic , although it continues to endure ethnic conflicts , revolts , economic troubles , transitional governments and political conflict . Kyrgyzstan is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States , the Eurasian Economic Union , the Collective Security Treaty Organization , the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the Turkic Council , the T\u00fcrksoy community and the United Nations . Ethnic Kyrgyz make up the majority of the country 's six million people , followed by significant minorities of Uzbeks and Russians .

At 17,125,200 square kilometres ( 6,612,100 sq mi ) , it is by far the largest country in the world by area , covering more than one-eighth of the Earth 's inhabited land area , spanning eleven time zones , and bordering 16 sovereign nations . The territory of Russia extends from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east , and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus in the south . With 146.7 million inhabitants living in the country 's 85 federal subjects as of 2020 , Russia is the most populous nation in Europe and the ninth-most populous nation in the world . Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants , the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century . In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire , beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium . Rus ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states , until it was finally reunified by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th century . By the 18th century , the nation had greatly expanded through conquest , annexation , and exploration to become the Russian Empire , which was the third largest empire in history , stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east . Following the Russian Revolution , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR/Soviet Union ) , the world 's first constitutionally socialist state .",
  "/wiki/Communism": "Communism ( from Latin communis , common , universal ) is a philosophical , social , political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society , namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes , money and the state . Communism includes a variety of schools of thought which broadly include Marxism and anarchism ( especially anarcho-communism ) as well as the political ideologies grouped around both . All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system and mode of production , capitalism ; that in this system there are two major social classes ; that conflict between these two classes is the root of all problems in society ; and that this situation will ultimately be resolved through a social revolution . The two classes are the proletariat ( the working class ) - who must work to survive and who make up the majority within society - and the bourgeoisie ( the capitalist class ) - a minority who derives profit from employing the working class through private ownership of the means of production . According to this analysis , revolution would put the working class in power and in turn establish social ownership of the means of production which is the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism . Along with social democracy , communism became the dominant political tendency within the international socialist movement by the 1920s . While the emergence of the Soviet Union as the world 's first nominally communist state led to communism 's widespread association with the Soviet economic model and Marxism-Leninism , some economists and intellectuals argued that in practice the model functioned as a form of state capitalism , or a non-planned administrative or command economy .",

Before Islam influence started in the 8th century AD , Tashkent was influenced by the Sogdian and Turkic cultures in its early history . After its destruction by Genghis Khan in 1219 , the city was rebuilt and profited from the Silk Road . From 18th to 19th century , the city became an independent city-state , before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand . In 1865 , it fell to the Russian Empire , and became the capital of Russian Turkestan . In Soviet times , Tashkent witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union . Much of the city was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake , though it was rebuilt afterwards as a model Soviet city . It was the fourth-largest city of the Soviet Union at the time , after Moscow , Leningrad and Kiev . Today , as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan , Tashkent retains a multi-ethnic population , with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority . In 2009 , the city celebrated its 2,200 years of written history ."
