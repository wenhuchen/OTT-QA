These Paralympics were one of the largest multi-sport events ever held in the United Kingdom after the 2012 Summer Olympics , and until the date the largest Paralympics ever : 4,302 athletes from 164 National Paralympic Committees participated , with fourteen countries appearing in the Paralympics for the first time ever . The lead-up to these games prominently emphasized the return of the Paralympic movement to its spiritual birthplace : in 1948 , the British village of Stoke Mandeville first hosted the Stoke Mandeville Games , an athletics event for disabled British veterans of the Second World War held to coincide with the opening of the Summer Olympics in London . They were the first-ever organized sporting event for disabled athletes and served as a precursor to the modern Paralympic Games . Stoke Mandeville also co-hosted the 1984 Summer Paralympics with Long Island , New York , after its original host , the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , pulled out due to financial issues . Organizers expected the Games to be the first Paralympics to achieve mass-market appeal , fuelled by continued enthusiasm from the British public following the country 's successful performance at the Summer Olympics , awareness of the United Kingdom 's role in the history of the Paralympics , public attention surrounding South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius ( who had recently become the first double amputee to compete in the Summer Olympics alongside able-bodied athletes ) , a major marketing campaign instituted by the Games ' local broadcaster , and growing media coverage of Paralympic sport . The games ultimately met these expectations , breaking records for ticket sales , heightening the profile of the Paralympics in relation to the Olympics , and prompting IPC president Philip Craven to declare them the greatest Paralympic Games ever . A total of 503 events in 20 sports were held during these games ; for the first time since their suspension after the 2000 Paralympics , events for the intellectually disabled were also held in selected sports .
