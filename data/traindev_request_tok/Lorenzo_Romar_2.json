International players , defined in the NBA 's collective bargaining agreement as non-US nationals who did not complete athletic eligibility at a U.S. high school , must turn 19 ( or older ) in the calendar year of the draft , up from 18 . As of 2016 , the only players to have declared for the NBA draft straight out of high school ever since these restrictions took place were Satnam Singh Bhamara ( 2015 ) , Thon Maker ( 2016 ) , and Anfernee Simons ( 2018 ) .

  "/wiki/Toronto_Raptors": "The Toronto Raptors are a Canadian professional basketball team based in Toronto . The Raptors compete in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) as a member of the league 's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division . They play their home games at the Scotiabank Arena , which they share with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA 's expansion into Canada , along with the Vancouver Grizzlies . Since the 2001-02 season , the Raptors have been the only Canadian-based team in the league , as the Grizzlies relocated from Vancouver to Memphis , Tennessee . As with most expansion teams , the Raptors struggled in their early years ; but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft-day trade in 1998 , the franchise set league-attendance records and made the NBA playoffs in 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 . Carter was instrumental in leading the team to their first playoff series win in 2001 , where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals . During the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons , they failed to make significant progress , and Carter was traded in 2004 to the New Jersey Nets . After Carter left , Chris Bosh emerged as the team leader . For the 2006-07 season , Bryan Colangelo was appointed as general manager , and through a combination of Bosh , 2006 first overall draft pick Andrea Bargnani , and a revamp of the roster , the Raptors qualified for their first playoff berth in five years , capturing the Atlantic Division title . In the 2007-08 season , they also advanced to the playoffs but failed to reach the post-season in each of the next five seasons . Colangelo overhauled the team 's roster for the 2009-10 season in a bid to persuade pending free agent Bosh to stay , but Bosh departed to sign with the Miami Heat in July 2010 , ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors .",

  "/wiki/2014_NBA_Draft": "The 2014 NBA draft was held on June 26 , 2014 , at Barclays Center in Brooklyn . National Basketball Association ( NBA ) teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players , including international players . The draft lottery took place on May 20 , 2014 . The Cleveland Cavaliers won the draft lottery to earn the first overall pick in the draft ; this is the fourth number-one pick for Cleveland since 2003 and third number-one pick over a four-year span from 2011-2014 . This draft would also be the first for the reborn Charlotte Hornets , who played as the Bobcats from 2004-2014 , since 2001 , when the original Charlotte Hornets last selected as the Charlotte Hornets before moving to New Orleans and eventually becoming the current New Orleans Pelicans . Television rights in the United States belonged to ESPN . It was tipped by many to be one of the deepest and most hyped draft classes in recent years , with several players touted as future stars . State Farm was the presenting sponsor of the draft . College underclassmen that were highly touted by NBA scouts and executives included : Andrew Wiggins , Jabari Parker , Joel Embiid , Aaron Gordon , Julius Randle , Zach LaVine , T. J. Warren , and Gary Harris . Other highly sought after talents included Australian player Dante Exum and Croatian player Dario \u0160ari\u0107 , who both declared for the draft , and Doug McDermott , who was automatically eligible as a graduating college senior . However , this draft class appeared to fail to live up to their expectations , with only two players ( Embiid and Nikola Joki\u0107 ) making an All-Star game so far in their careers . Highlights from the draft included the first selections made by Adam Silver as commissioner and Mark Tatum as deputy commissioner , the second Canadian to be the first overall pick ( Andrew Wiggins ) , the first pair of Canadian top 10 picks and second pair of Canadian lottery picks ( Wiggins and Nik Stauskas ) , three top 20 Canadian selections ( Wiggins , Stauskas , and Tyler Ennis ) , the first NBA Development League player to be selected in the first round ( P.

  "/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers": "The Los Angeles Clippers ( branded as the LA Clippers ) are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles .

The franchise was founded in 1970 as the Buffalo Braves , and were one of three expansion teams to join the NBA that year , along with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Portland Trail Blazers . The Braves saw some success and reached the playoffs three times , led by league Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Bob McAdoo . Conflicts with the Canisius Golden Griffins over the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium and the sale of the franchise led to their relocating from Buffalo , New York , to San Diego , California . In 1978 , upon relocating , the franchise was rebranded to be known as the San Diego Clippers , in reference to the sailing ships that can be seen in the San Diego Bay . The franchise saw limited success on the court in its six years in San Diego despite the acquisition of star center Bill Walton , who missed nearly three full seasons due to injury upon his arrival . In 1981 , the franchise was acquired by Los Angeles-based real estate mogul Donald Sterling . In 1984 , the franchise was controversially relocated to Los Angeles by Sterling without the approval of the NBA . Despite fines and a lawsuit brought on against franchise ownership by the NBA seeking to return the franchise to San Diego , the team was ultimately permitted to remain in Los Angeles , where they failed to see significant regular season or playoff success . They were frequently seen as an example of a perennial loser in American professional sports , drawing unfavorable comparisons to their historically successful city-rivals , the Lakers .",

It was televised nationally in the U.S. by ESPN , and was live streamed for the first time in NBA draft history by The Vertical . National Basketball Association ( NBA ) teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players , including international players . The draft lottery took place during the playoffs , on May 17 , 2016 . This was the first time since the lottery system was introduced in 1985 that all NBA teams that missed out on the playoffs remained in the exact spots they were designated , meaning the 10-win/72-loss Philadelphia 76ers received the No . 1 pick , the Los Angeles Lakers kept the No . 2 pick , the Boston Celtics via the Brooklyn Nets got the No . 3 pick , and everyone else stayed in their same spots based on the regular season standings from the 2015-16 season .

The 53-29 Boston Celtics , who were also the # 1 seed in the Eastern Conference and reached the Eastern Conference Finals at the time of the NBA draft lottery , won the # 1 pick with pick swapping rights thanks to a previous trade with the Brooklyn Nets , who had the worst record the previous season . The Los Angeles Lakers , who had risked losing their 2017 first round pick to the Philadelphia 76ers , moved up two spots to get the No . 2 pick , while Philadelphia moved up to receive the No . 3 pick due to the Sacramento Kings moving up in the draft , which activated pick swapping rights the 76ers had from an earlier trade . On June 19 , four days before the NBA draft began , the Celtics and 76ers traded their top first round picks to each other , meaning the holders of the top four picks of this year 's draft would be exactly the same as the previous year 's draft . The draft class was the youngest draft class to date , with the most freshmen and fewest seniors selected in the first round ; the top seven picks in the draft were college freshmen . It was the third time , and the second in a row , that three players were selected from Serbian team KK Mega Basket in the same draft ( Vlatko \u010can\u010dar , Ognjen Jaramaz , Alpha Kaba ) , with it previously occurring during the 2014 and 2016 NBA draft .
