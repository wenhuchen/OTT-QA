  "/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration": "The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA or USFDA ) is a federal agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services , one of the United States federal executive departments . The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety , tobacco products , dietary supplements , prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs ( medications ) , vaccines , biopharmaceuticals , blood transfusions , medical devices , electromagnetic radiation emitting devices ( ERED ) , cosmetics , animal foods & feed and veterinary products . The FDA was empowered by the United States Congress to enforce the Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act , which serves as the primary focus for the Agency ; the FDA also enforces other laws , notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and associated regulations , many of which are not directly related to food or drugs . These include regulating lasers , cellular phones , condoms and control of disease on products ranging from certain household pets to sperm donation for assisted reproduction . The FDA is led by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs , appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate . The Commissioner reports to the Secretary of Health and Human Services . Stephen M. Hahn , MD is the acting commissioner , as of December 2019 [ update ] . The FDA has its headquarters in unincorporated White Oak , Maryland . The agency also has 223 field offices and 13 laboratories located throughout the 50 states , the United States Virgin Islands , and Puerto Rico . In 2008 , the FDA began to post employees to foreign countries , including China , India , Costa Rica , Chile , Belgium , and the United Kingdom .",
  "/wiki/Adinazolam": "Adinazolam ( marketed under the brand name Deracyn ) is a benzodiazepine derivative , and more specifically , a triazolobenzodiazepine ( TBZD ) . It possesses anxiolytic , anticonvulsant , sedative , and antidepressant properties . Adinazolam was developed by Dr. Jackson B. Hester , who was seeking to enhance the antidepressant properties of alprazolam , which he also developed . Adinazolam was never FDA approved and never made available to the public market , however it has been sold as a designer drug .",
  "/wiki/Research_chemical": "Research chemicals are chemical substances used by scientists for medical and scientific research purposes . One characteristic of a research chemical is that it is for laboratory research use only ; a research chemical is not intended for human or veterinary use . This distinction is required on the labels of research chemicals , and is what exempts them from regulation under parts 100-740 in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations ( 21CFR ) .",
  "/wiki/Anxiolytic": "An anxiolytic ( also antipanic or antianxiety agent ) is a medication , or other intervention , that inhibits anxiety . This effect is in contrast to anxiogenic agents , which increase anxiety . Together these categories of psychoactive compounds or interventions may be referred to as anxiotropic compounds or agents . Some recreational drugs such as alcohol induce anxiolysis initially ; however , studies show that many of these drugs are anxiogenic . Anxiolytic medications have been used for the treatment of anxiety disorder and its related psychological and physical symptoms . Light therapy and other interventions have also been found to have an anxiolytic effect . Beta-receptor blockers such as propranolol and oxprenolol , although not anxiolytics , can be used to combat the somatic symptoms of anxiety such as tachycardia and palpitations . Anxiolytics are also known as minor tranquilizers . The term is less common in modern texts and was originally derived from a dichotomy with major tranquilizers , also known as neuroleptics or antipsychotics . There are concerns that some GABAergics , such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates , may have an anxiogenic effect if used over long periods of time .",
  "/wiki/Antidepressant": "Antidepressants are medications used to treat major depressive disorder , some anxiety disorders , some chronic pain conditions , and to help manage some addictions . Common side-effects of antidepressants include dry mouth , weight gain , dizziness , headaches , and sexual dysfunction . Most types of antidepressants are typically safe to take , but may cause increased thoughts of suicide when taken by children , adolescents , and young adults . A discontinuation syndrome can occur after stopping any antidepressant which resembles recurrent depression . Some reviews of antidepressants for depression in adults find benefit while others do not . Evidence of benefit in children and adolescents is unclear . There is debate in the medical community about how much of the observed effects of antidepressants can be attributed to the placebo effect .",
  "/wiki/Alprazolam": "Alprazolam , sold under the trade name Xanax , among others , is a short-acting benzodiazepine . It is most commonly used in short term management of anxiety disorders , specifically panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) . Other uses include the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea , together with other treatments . GAD improvement occurs generally within a week . Alprazolam is generally taken by mouth . Common side effects include sleepiness , depression , headaches , feeling tired , dry mouth , and memory problems . Some of the sedation and tiredness may improve within a few days . Due to concerns about misuse , some do not recommend alprazolam as an initial treatment for panic disorder . Withdrawal or rebound symptoms may occur if use is suddenly decreased . Other rare risks include suicide , possibly due to loss of inhibition . Gradually decreasing the dose over weeks or months may be required . Alprazolam , like other benzodiazepines , acts through the GABAA receptor .",
  "/wiki/Bentazepam": "Bentazepam ( also known as Thiadipone , Tiadipona ) is a thienodiazepine which is a benzodiazepine analog . It possesses anxiolytic , anticonvulsant , sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties . Peak plasma rates are achieved in around 2,5 hours after oral administration . The elimination half-life is between approximately 2-4 hours . Bentazepam is effective as an anxiolytic . A severe benzodiazepine overdose with bentazepam may result in coma and respiratory failure . Adverse effects include dry mouth , somnolence , asthenia , dyspepsia , constipation , nausea and drug-induced lymphocytic colitis has been associated with bentazepam . Severe liver damage and hepatitis has also been associated with bentazepam . Whilst liver failure from bentazepam is considered to be rare , liver function monitoring has been recommended for all patients taking bentazepam .",
  "/wiki/Bretazenil": "Bretazenil ( Ro16-6028 ) is an imidazopyrrolobenzodiazepine anxiolytic drug which is derived from the benzodiazepine family , and was invented in 1988 . It is most closely related in structure to the GABA antagonist flumazenil , although its effects are somewhat different . It is classified as a high-potency benzodiazepine due to its high affinity binding to benzodiazepine binding sites where it acts as a partial agonist . Its profile as a partial agonist and preclinical trial data suggests that it may have a reduced adverse effect profile . In particular bretazenil has been proposed to cause a less strong development of tolerance and withdrawal syndrome . Bretazenil differs from traditional 1,4-benzodiazepines by being a partial agonist and because it binds to \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 and \u03b16 subunit containing GABAA receptor benzodiazepine receptor complexes . 1,4-benzodiazepines bind only to \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 and \u03b15 GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complexes .",
  "/wiki/Anticonvulsant": "Anticonvulsants ( also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs ) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures . Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder , since many seem to act as mood stabilizers , and for the treatment of neuropathic pain . Anticonvulsants suppress the excessive rapid firing of neurons during seizures . Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain . Conventional antiepileptic drugs may block sodium channels or enhance \u03b3-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) function . Several antiepileptic drugs have multiple or uncertain mechanisms of action . Next to the voltage-gated sodium channels and components of the GABA system , their targets include GABAA receptors , the GAT-1 GABA transporter , and GABA transaminase . Additional targets include voltage-gated calcium channels , SV2A , and \u03b12\u03b4 . By blocking sodium or calcium channels , antiepileptic drugs reduce the release of excitatory glutamate , whose release is considered to be elevated in epilepsy , but also that of GABA . This is probably a side effect or even the actual mechanism of action for some antiepileptic drugs , since GABA can itself , directly or indirectly , act proconvulsively . Another potential target of antiepileptic drugs is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha . The drug class was the fifth-best-selling in the United States in 2007 .",
  "/wiki/Bromazepam": "Bromazepam , sold under many brand names , is a benzodiazepine . It is mainly an anti-anxiety agent with similar side effects to diazepam ( Valium ) . In addition to being used to treat anxiety or panic states , bromazepam may be used as a premedicant prior to minor surgery . Bromazepam typically comes in doses of 3 mg and 6 mg tablets . Bromazepam is contraindicated and should be used with caution in women who are pregnant , the elderly , patients with a history of alcohol or other substance abuse disorders and children . Prolonged use of bromazepam causes tolerance and may lead to both physical and psychological dependence on the drug , and as a result , it is a medication which is controlled by international law . It was patented in 1961 by Roche and approved for medical use in 1974 .",
  "/wiki/Hypnotic": "Hypnotic ( from Greek Hypnos , sleep ) , or soporific drugs , commonly known as sleeping pills , are a class of psychoactive drugs whose primary function is to induce sleep and to be used in the treatment of insomnia ( sleeplessness ) , or for surgical anesthesia . [ note 1 ] This group is related to sedatives . Whereas the term sedative describes drugs that serve to calm or relieve anxiety , the term hypnotic generally describes drugs whose main purpose is to initiate , sustain , or lengthen sleep . Because these two functions frequently overlap , and because drugs in this class generally produce dose-dependent effects ( ranging from anxiolysis to loss of consciousness ) they are often referred to collectively as sedative-hypnotic drugs . Hypnotic drugs are regularly prescribed for insomnia and other sleep disorders , with over 95% of insomnia patients being prescribed hypnotics in some countries . Many hypnotic drugs are habit-forming and , due to many factors known to disturb the human sleep pattern , a physician may instead recommend changes in the environment before and during sleep , better sleep hygiene , the avoidance of caffeine or other stimulating substances , or behavioral interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia ( CBT-I ) before prescribing medication for sleep . When prescribed , hypnotic medication should be used for the shortest period of time necessary . Among individuals with sleep disorders , 13.7% are taking or prescribed nonbenzodiazepines , while 10.8% are taking benzodiazepines , as of 2010 . Early classes of drugs , such as barbiturates , have fallen out of use in most practices but are still prescribed for some patients . In children , prescribing hypnotics is not yet acceptable unless used to treat night terrors or somnambulism . Elderly people are more sensitive to potential side effects of daytime fatigue and cognitive impairments , and a meta-analysis found that the risks generally outweigh any marginal benefits of hypnotics in the elderly . A review of the literature regarding benzodiazepine hypnotics and Z-drugs concluded that these drugs can have adverse effects , such as dependence and accidents , and that optimal treatment uses the lowest effective dose for the shortest therapeutic time period , with gradual discontinuation in order to improve health without worsening of sleep .",
  "/wiki/Bromazolam": "Bromazolam ( XLI-268 ) is a benzodiazepine derivative which was first synthesised in 1976 , but was never marketed . It has subsequently been sold as a designer drug , first being definitively identified by the EMCDDA in Sweden in 2016 . It is the bromo instead of chloro analogue of alprazolam , and has similar sedative and anxiolytic effects . Bromazolam is a non subtype selective agonist at the benzodiazepine site of GABAA receptors , with a binding affinity of 2.81nM at the \u03b11 subtype , 0.69nM at \u03b12 and 0.62nM at \u03b15 .",
  "/wiki/Brotizolam": "Brotizolam ( marketed under brand name Lendormin ) is a sedative-hypnotic thienotriazolodiazepine drug which is a benzodiazepine analog . It possesses anxiolytic , anticonvulsant , hypnotic , sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties , and is considered to be similar in effect to short-acting benzodiazepines such as triazolam . It is used in the short-term treatment of severe or debilitating insomnia . Brotizolam is an extremely potent drug and has shown anti-anxiety activity at doses as low as 0.08 to 0.1 milligrams , but the usual hypnotic dose of brotizolam is 0.125 to 0.25 milligrams , and it is rapidly eliminated with an average half-life of 4.4 hours ( range 3.6-7.9 hours ) . It was patented in 1974 and came into medical use in 1984 . Brotizolam is not approved for sale in the UK , United States or Canada . It is approved for sale in the Netherlands , Germany , Spain , Belgium , Luxembourg , Austria , Portugal , Israel , Italy , Taiwan and Japan .",
  "/wiki/Camazepam": "Camazepam is a benzodiazepine psychoactive drug , marketed under the brand names Albego , Limpidon and Paxor . It is the dimethyl carbamate ester of temazepam , a metabolite of diazepam . While it possesses anxiolytic , anticonvulsant , skeletal muscle relaxant and hypnotic properties it differs from other benzodiazepines in that its anxiolytic properties are particularly prominent but has comparatively limited anticonvulsant , hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant properties .",
  "/wiki/Chlordiazepoxide": "Chlordiazepoxide , trade name Librium among others , is a sedative and hypnotic medication of the benzodiazepine class ; it is used to treat anxiety , insomnia and withdrawal symptoms from alcohol and/or drug abuse . Chlordiazepoxide has a medium to long half-life but its active metabolite has a very long half-life . The drug has amnesic , anticonvulsant , anxiolytic , hypnotic , sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties . Chlordiazepoxide was patented in 1958 and approved for medical use in 1960 . It was the first benzodiazepine to be synthesized and the discovery of chlordiazepoxide was by pure chance . Chlordiazepoxide and other benzodiazepines were initially accepted with widespread public approval but were followed with widespread public disapproval and recommendations for more restrictive medical guidelines for its use .",
  "/wiki/Cinazepam": "Cinazepam ( BD-798 , sold under brand name Levana ) is an atypical benzodiazepine derivative . It produces pronounced hypnotic , sedative , and anxiolytic effects with minimal myorelaxant side effects . In addition , unlike many other benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics such as diazepam , flunitrazepam , and zopiclone , cinazepam does not violate sleep architecture , and the continuity of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep are proportionally increased . As such , cinazepam produces a sleep state close to physiological , and for that reason , may be advantageous compared to other , related drugs in the treatment of insomnia and other sleep disorders . Cinazepam has an order of magnitude lower affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor of the GABAA complex relative to other well-known hypnotic benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam and phenazepam . Moreover , in mice , it is rapidly metabolized , with only 5% of the base compound remaining within 30 minutes of administration . As such , cinazepam is considered to be a benzodiazepine prodrug ; specifically , to 3-hydroxyphenazepam , as the main active metabolite .",
  "/wiki/Cinolazepam": "Cinolazepam ( marketed under the brand name Gerodorm ) is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative . It possesses anxiolytic , anticonvulsant , sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties . Due to its strong sedative properties , it is primarily used as a hypnotic .

Clobazam was first synthesized in 1966 and first published in 1969 . Clobazam was originally marketed as an anxioselective anxiolytic since 1970 and an anticonvulsant since 1984 . The primary drug-development goal was to provide greater anxiolytic , anti-obsessive efficacy with fewer benzodiazepine-related side effects .",
  "/wiki/Clonazepam": "Clonazepam , sold under the brand Klonopin among others , is a medication used to prevent and treat seizures , panic disorder , and the movement disorder known as akathisia . It is a tranquilizer of the benzodiazepine class . It is taken by mouth . It begins having an effect within 1 hour and lasts between 6 and 12 hours . Common side effects include sleepiness , poor coordination , and agitation . Long-term use may result in tolerance , dependence , and withdrawal symptoms if stopped abruptly . Dependence occurs in one-third of people who take clonazepam for longer than four weeks . There is an increased risk of suicide , particularly in people who are already depressed . If used during pregnancy it may result in harm to the baby . Clonazepam binds to GABAA receptors , thus increasing the effect of the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) . Clonazepam was patented in 1960 and went on sale in 1975 in the United States from Roche . It is available as a generic medication .",
  "/wiki/Muscle_relaxant": "A muscle relaxant is a drug that affects skeletal muscle function and decreases the muscle tone . It may be used to alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms , pain , and hyperreflexia . The term muscle relaxant is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups : neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics . Neuromuscular blockers act by interfering with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and have no central nervous system ( CNS ) activity . They are often used during surgical procedures and in intensive care and emergency medicine to cause temporary paralysis . Spasmolytics , also known as centrally acting muscle relaxants , are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions . While both neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics are often grouped together as muscle relaxants , the term is commonly used to refer to spasmolytics only .",

  "/wiki/Amnesic": "Amnesia is a deficit in memory caused by brain damage or disease , but it can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs . The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused . There are two main types of amnesia : retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia . Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date , usually the date of an accident or operation . In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades , while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory . Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store into the long-term store . People with anterograde amnesia can not remember things for long periods of time . These two types are not mutually exclusive ; both can occur simultaneously . Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to the medial temporal lobe . In addition , specific areas of the hippocampus ( the CA1 region ) are involved with memory . Research has also shown that when areas of the diencephalon are damaged , amnesia can occur . Recent studies have shown a correlation between deficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss .",

  "/wiki/List_of_benzodiazepines": "The below tables contain a sample list of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine analogs that are commonly prescribed , with their basic pharmacological characteristics , such as half-life and equivalent doses to other benzodiazepines , also listed , along with their trade names and primary uses . The elimination half-life is how long it takes for half of the drug to be eliminated by the body . Time to peak refers to when maximum levels of the drug in the blood occur after a given dose . Benzodiazepines generally share the same pharmacological properties , such as anxiolytic , sedative , hypnotic , skeletal muscle relaxant , amnesic , and anticonvulsant effects . Variation in potency of certain effects may exist amongst individual benzodiazepines . Some benzodiazepines produce active metabolites . Active metabolites are produced when a person 's body metabolizes the drug into compounds that share a similar pharmacological profile to the parent compound and thus are relevant when calculating how long the pharmacological effects of a drug will last . Long-acting benzodiazepines with long-acting active metabolites , such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide , are often prescribed for benzodiazepine or alcohol withdrawal as well as for anxiety if constant dose levels are required throughout the day . Shorter-acting benzodiazepines are often preferred for insomnia due to their lesser hangover effect . It is fairly important to note that elimination half-life of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide , as well as other long half-life benzodiazepines , is twice as long in the elderly compared to younger individuals . Individuals with an impaired liver also metabolize benzodiazepines more slowly . Many doctors [ who ? ]",

It may also be used to cause memory loss during certain medical procedures . It can be taken by mouth , inserted into the rectum , injected into muscle , injected into a vein or used as a nasal spray . When given into a vein , effects begin in one to five minutes and last up to an hour . By mouth , effects begin after 15 to 60 minutes . Common side effects include sleepiness and trouble with coordination . Serious side effects are rare . They include suicide , decreased breathing , and an increased risk of seizures if used too frequently in those with epilepsy . Occasionally excitement or agitation may occur . Long term use can result in tolerance , dependence , and withdrawal symptoms on dose reduction . Abrupt stopping after long-term use can be potentially dangerous .",
