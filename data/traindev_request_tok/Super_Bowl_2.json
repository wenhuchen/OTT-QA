  "/wiki/Miami_metropolitan_area": "The Miami metropolitan area , also known as the Greater Miami Area or South Florida , is the 72nd largest metropolitan area in the world and the seventh-largest metropolitan area in the United States . Located in southern Florida with 6,198,782 inhabitants as of 2018 , the Miami metropolitan area is the most populous in Florida and second largest in the southeastern United States . It extends about 120 miles ( 190 km ) from north to south . The metropolitan area is defined by the Office of Management and Budget as the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach , FL ( MSA ) , consisting of Miami-Dade , Broward , and Palm Beach counties , a metropolitan statistical area used for statistical purposes by the United States Census Bureau and other agencies . Its land area is 6,137 sq . mi ( 15,890 km2 ) . Miami-Dade , Broward , and Palm Beach counties are the first , second , and third most populous counties in Florida , and Miami-Dade , with 2,761,581 people in 2018 , is the seventh most populous county in the United States . The three counties together are known as the Greater Miami Area and have principal cities including Miami , Fort Lauderdale , West Palm Beach , Hialeah , Pembroke Pines and Boca Raton . Besides its association with the South Florida region , which includes the Everglades and the Florida Keys , it is also synonymous with an area known collectively as the Gold Coast . The Census Bureau also defines a wider region based on commuting patterns , the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Port St. Lucie , FL Combined Statistical Area ( CSA ) , with an estimated population of 6,723,472 in 2016 . This includes the four additional counties of Martin , St. Lucie , Indian River , and Okeechobee . Because the population of South Florida is largely confined to a strip of land between the Atlantic Ocean and the Everglades , the Miami urbanized area ( that is , the area of contiguous urban development ) is about 100 miles ( 160 km ) long ( north to south ) , but never more than 20 miles ( 32 km ) wide , and in some areas only 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) wide ( east to west ) .",
  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_II": "The second AFL-NFL World Championship Game in professional football , known retroactively as Super Bowl II , was played on January 14 , 1968 , at the Orange Bowl in Miami , Florida . The National Football League ( NFL ) 's defending champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League ( AFL ) champion Oakland Raiders by the score of 33-14 . This game and Super Bowl III are the only two Super Bowl games to be played in back-to-back years in the same stadium . Coming into this game , like during the first Super Bowl , many sports writers and fans believed that any team in the NFL was vastly superior to any club in the AFL . The Packers , the defending champions , posted a 9-4-1 record during the 1967 NFL season before defeating the Dallas Cowboys , 21-17 , in the 1967 NFL Championship Game ( also popularly known as the Ice Bowl ) . The Raiders finished the 1967 AFL season at 13-1 , and defeated the Houston Oilers , 40-7 , in the 1967 AFL Championship Game . As expected , Green Bay dominated Oakland throughout most of Super Bowl II . The Raiders could only score two touchdown passes from quarterback Daryle Lamonica . Meanwhile , Packers kicker Don Chandler made four field goals , including three in the first half , while defensive back Herb Adderley had a 60-yard interception return for a touchdown . Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr was named the MVP for the second straight time , becoming the first back-to-back Super Bowl MVP for his 13 of 24 passes for 202 yards and one touchdown .",
  "/wiki/Super_Bowl_III": "Super Bowl III was the third AFL-NFL Championship Game in professional American football , and the first to officially bear the trademark name Super Bowl . Played on January 12 , 1969 , at the Orange Bowl in Miami , Florida , the game is regarded as one of the greatest upsets in both American football history and in the recorded history of sports . The 18-point underdog American Football League ( AFL ) champion New York Jets defeated the National Football League ( NFL ) champion Baltimore Colts by a score of 16-7 . This was the first Super Bowl victory for the AFL . Before the game , most sports writers and fans believed that AFL teams were less talented than NFL clubs , and expected the Colts to defeat the Jets by a wide margin . Baltimore posted a 13-1 record in the regular season and shut out the Cleveland Browns 34-0 in the NFL Championship Game . The Jets were 11-3 in the regular season , and defeated the Oakland Raiders 27-23 in the AFL Championship Game . Jets quarterback Joe Namath famously made an appearance three days before the Super Bowl at the Miami Touchdown Club and personally guaranteed his team 's victory . His team backed up his words by controlling most of the game , building a 16-0 lead by the fourth quarter off of a touchdown run by Matt Snell and three field goals by Jim Turner . Colts quarterback Earl Morrall threw three interceptions before being replaced by Johnny Unitas , who then led Baltimore to its only touchdown , during the last few minutes of the game . With the victory , the Jets were the only winning team to score only one touchdown ( either offensive , defensive , or special teams ) until the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII . Namath , who completed 17 out of 28 passes for 206 yards , was named as the Super Bowl 's most valuable player , making him the first player in Super Bowl history to be declared MVP without personally scoring or throwing for a touchdown .",

The Colts defeated the Cowboys by the score of 16-13 on a field goal with 5 seconds left in the game . The game was played on January 17 , 1971 , at the Orange Bowl in Miami , Florida , the first Super Bowl game played on artificial turf , on first-generation Poly-Turf . This was the first Super Bowl played after the completion of the AFL-NFL merger . Beginning with this game and continuing to the present day , the Super Bowl has served as the NFL 's league championship game , with the winner of the AFC Championship Game and the winner of the NFC Championship Game facing off in the culmination of the NFL playoffs . As per the merger agreement , all 26 AFL and NFL teams were divided into two conferences with 13 teams in each . Along with the Colts , the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers agreed to join the ten AFL teams to form the AFC ; the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the NFC . This explains why the Colts represented the NFL in Super Bowl III , but the AFC for Super Bowl V. Baltimore advanced to Super Bowl V after posting an 11-2-1 regular season record . Meanwhile , the Cowboys were making their first Super Bowl appearance after posting a 10-4 regular season record . The game is sometimes called the Blunder Bowl , Blooper Bowl , or Stupor Bowl because it was filled with poor play , a missed PAT , penalties , turnovers , and officiating miscues . The two teams combined for a Super Bowl record 11 turnovers , with five in the fourth quarter . The Colts ' seven turnovers remain the most committed by a Super Bowl champion .",

Both the pre-game and halftime show celebrated the Bicentennial , while players on both teams wore special patches on their jerseys with the Bicentennial logo . Super Bowl X featured a contrast of playing styles between the Steelers and the Cowboys , which were , at the time , the two most popular teams in the league . The Steelers , dominating teams with their Steel Curtain defense and running game , finished the regular season with a league best 12-2 record and defeated the Baltimore Colts and the Oakland Raiders in the playoffs . The Cowboys , with their offense and flex defense , became the first NFC wild-card team to advance to the Super Bowl after posting a 10-4 regular season record and postseason victories over the Minnesota Vikings and the Los Angeles Rams . Trailing 10-7 in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl X , the Steelers rallied to score 14 unanswered points , including a 64-yard touchdown reception by Pittsburgh wide receiver Lynn Swann .

The 49ers defeated the Chargers by the score of 49-26 , becoming the first team to win five Super Bowl championships . The game was played on January 29 , 1995 at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami , Florida ( now part of the suburb of Miami Gardens , which became a separate city in 2003 ) .

With Young at the helm , and a defense consisting of several veteran free agents who joined the team during the previous offseason , San Francisco finished the regular season with a league-best 13-3 record , and led the league in total points scored ( 505 ) . The Chargers , on the other hand , were regarded as a Cinderella team , and advanced to their first Super Bowl after posting an 11-5 regular-season record and overcoming halftime deficits in both of their playoff wins . This was the first Super Bowl in which both teams scored in all four quarters . The combined aggregate score of 75 points and the ten total touchdowns both remain Super Bowl records .

Young was named the Super Bowl MVP , throwing a Super Bowl-record six touchdown passes , and completing 24 out of 36 passes for 325 yards . Despite the predicted blowout ( 18\u00bd points is the largest margin a team has been favored by in a Super Bowl ) , the fact that San Diego did not have as much national appeal nor a relatively large core fan base , and two teams from California playing , which could have significantly diminished interest along the East Coast , the telecast of the game on ABC still had a Nielsen rating of 41.3 .",

With an estimated population of 391,006 in 2018 , it is the most populous city in Louisiana . Serving as a major port , New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States . New Orleans is world-renowned for its distinct music , Creole cuisine , unique dialect , and its annual celebrations and festivals , most notably Mardi Gras . The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter , known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street . The city has been described as the most unique in the United States , owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage . Founded in 1718 by French colonists , New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before being traded to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 . New Orleans in 1840 was the third-most populous city in the United States , and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II . The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding , due to such factors as high rainfall , low lying elevation , poor natural drainage and location next to multiple bodies of water . State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city . New Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29 , 2005 , which resulted in flooding more than 80% of the city , thousands of deaths , and so much displacement because of damaged communities and lost housing as to cause a population decline of over 50% . Since Katrina , major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city 's population .",

Despite the AFL 's New York Jets winning the previous season 's Super Bowl , many sports writers and fans thought it was a fluke and continued to believe that the NFL was still superior to the AFL , and thus fully expected the Vikings to defeat the Chiefs ; the Vikings entered the Super Bowl as 12\u00bd to 13\u00bd-point favorites .

The Bears defeated the Patriots by the score of 46-10 , capturing their first NFL championship since 1963 , three years prior to the birth of the Super Bowl . Super Bowl XX was played on January 26 , 1986 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans . This was the fourth Super Bowl and , to date , the last time in which both teams made their Super Bowl debuts . The Bears entered the game after becoming the second team in NFL history to win 15 regular season games . With their then-revolutionary 46 defense , Chicago led the league in several defensive categories , outscored their opponents with a staggering margin of 456-198 , and recorded two postseason shutouts . The Patriots were considered a Cinderella team during the 1985 season , and posted an 11-5 regular season record , but entered the playoffs as a wild card because of tiebreakers . But defying the odds , New England posted three road playoff wins to advance to Super Bowl XX . In their victory over the Patriots , the Bears set or tied Super Bowl records for sacks ( seven ) , fewest rushing yards allowed ( seven ) , and margin of victory ( 36 points ) . At the time , New England broke the record for the quickest lead in Super Bowl history , with Tony Franklin 's 36-yard field goal 1:19 into the first quarter after a Chicago fumble . But the Patriots were eventually held to negative yardage ( \u221219 ) throughout the entire first half , and finished with just 123 total yards from scrimmage , the second lowest total yards in Super Bowl history , behind the Minnesota Vikings ( 119 total yards ) in Super Bowl IX .

The 49ers finished the 1989 regular season with a league best 14-2 record . The Broncos , who posted an 11-5 regular season record , entered the Super Bowl looking to avoid tying the Minnesota Vikings with four Super Bowl losses as well as the Vikings record of losing three Super Bowls in four years . This game remains the most lopsided game in Super Bowl history . San Francisco 's 55 points were the most ever scored by one team , and their 45-point margin of victory was the largest ever . The 49ers are also the only team to score at least eight touchdowns in a Super Bowl and at least two touchdowns in each quarter ( the only mistake was a missed extra point attempt ) . San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana was named the Super Bowl MVP , his third award in his fourth Super Bowl victory . He completed 22 of 29 passes for a total of 297 yards and a Super Bowl record 5 touchdowns , while also rushing for 15 yards .

The game was played on January 26 , 1997 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans , Louisiana . This Super Bowl featured two clubs that had recently returned to competitiveness .

The pregame ceremonies and the halftime show headlined by the Irish rock band U2 honored the victims of 9/11 . Due to heightened security measures following the terrorist attacks , this was the first Super Bowl designated as a National Special Security Event ( NSSE ) by the Office of Homeland Security ( OHS ) . The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , which replaced the OHS in 2003 , later established the practice of naming each subsequent Super Bowl an NSSE .

In addition , Super Bowl XLVII was the first to feature two teams that had undefeated records in previous Super Bowl games ( Baltimore , 1-0 ; San Francisco , 5-0 ) . The 49ers , who posted a regular-season record of 11-4-1 , entered the game seeking their sixth Super Bowl win in team history ( and first since Super Bowl XXIX at the end of the 1994 season ) , which would have tied the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most by a franchise . The Ravens , who posted a 10-6 regular-season record , made their second Super Bowl appearance in 12 years , having previously won Super Bowl XXXV .

The National Football League ( NFL ) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League ( AFL ) champion Kansas City Chiefs by the score of 35-10 . Coming into this game , considerable animosity existed between the AFL and NFL , thus the teams representing the two rival leagues ( Kansas City and Green Bay , respectively ) felt pressure to win . The Chiefs posted an 11-2-1 record during the 1966 AFL season , and defeated the Buffalo Bills 31-7 , in the AFL Championship Game . The Packers finished the 1966 NFL season at 12-2 , and defeated the Dallas Cowboys 34-27 in the NFL Championship Game . Still , many sports writers and fans believed any team in the older NFL was vastly superior to any club in the upstart AFL , and so expected Green Bay would blow out Kansas City . The first half of Super Bowl I was competitive , as the Chiefs outgained the Packers in total yards , 181-164 , to come within 14-10 at halftime . Early in the 3rd quarter , Green Bay safety Willie Wood intercepted a pass and returned it 50 yards to the 5-yard line . The turnover sparked the Packers to score 21 unanswered points in the second half . Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr , who completed 16 of 23 passes for 250 yards and two touchdowns , with one interception , was named MVP .

The Redskins were making their first Super Bowl appearance after posting an 11-3 regular-season record and playoff victories over the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys . Despite being undefeated , the Dolphins were actually one-point underdogs , largely based on the weakness of their regular-season schedule .

  "/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area": "The San Francisco Bay Area , popularly referred to as the Bay Area or simply the Bay , is a populous region surrounding the San Francisco , San Pablo , and Suisun Bay estuaries in Northern California . Although the exact boundaries of the region vary depending on the source , the Bay Area is defined by the Association of Bay Area Governments to include the nine counties that border the aforementioned estuaries : Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , Napa , San Mateo , Santa Clara , Solano , Sonoma , and San Francisco . Other sources may exclude parts of or even entire counties , or expand the definition to include neighboring counties that do not border the bay such as San Benito , San Joaquin , and Santa Cruz . Home to approximately 7.75 million people , Northern California 's nine-county Bay Area contains many cities , towns , airports , and associated regional , state , and national parks , connected by a complex multimodal transportation network . The larger combined statistical area of the region , which includes fourteen counties , is the second-largest in California ( after the Greater Los Angeles area ) , the fifth-largest in the United States , and the 41st-largest urban area in the world with 9.67 million people . The Bay Area 's population is ethnically diverse : for example , roughly half of the region 's residents are Hispanic , Asian , African American , or Pacific Islander , all of whom have a significant presence throughout the region . The earliest archaeological evidence of human settlements in the Bay Area dates back to 8000-10,000 BC ( from shell mounds in the Coyote Hills ) . In 1769 , the Bay Area was inhabited by the Ohlone people when a Spanish exploration party led by Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 entered the Bay - the first documented European visit to the Bay Area . After Mexico established independence from Spain in 1821 , the region was briefly controlled by the Mexican government until the United States purchased the territory in 1846 during the Mexican-American War . Soon after , discovery of gold in California attracted a flood of treasure seekers , many using ports in the Bay Area as an entry point . During the early years of California 's statehood , state legislative business rotated between three locations in the Bay Area before a permanent state capital was established in Sacramento . A major earthquake leveled the city of San Francisco and environs in 1906 , but the region quickly rebuilt in time to host the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition .",
