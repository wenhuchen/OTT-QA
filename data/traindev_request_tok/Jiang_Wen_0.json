He was born Ying Zheng ( \u5b34\u653f ) or Zhao Zheng ( \u8d99\u653f ) , a prince of the state of Qin . He became Zheng , the King of Qin ( \u79e6\u738b\u653f ) when he was thirteen , then China 's first emperor when he was 38 after the Qin had conquered all of the other Warring States and unified all of China in 221 BC . Rather than maintain the title of king ( \u738b w\u00e1ng ) borne by the previous Shang and Zhou rulers , he ruled as the First Emperor ( \u59cb\u7687\u5e1d ) of the Qin dynasty from 221 BC to 210 BC . His self-invented title emperor ( \u7687\u5e1d hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec ) , as indicated by his use of the word First , would continue to be borne by Chinese rulers for the next two millennia . During his reign , his generals greatly expanded the size of the Chinese state : campaigns south of Chu permanently added the Yue lands of Hunan and Guangdong to the Chinese cultural orbit ; campaigns in Central Asia conquered the Ordos Loop from the nomad Xiongnu , although eventually it would also lead to their confederation under Modu Chanyu . Qin Shi Huang also worked with his minister Li Si to enact major economic and political reforms aimed at the standardization of the diverse practices of the earlier Chinese states . He is traditionally said to have banned and burned many books and executed scholars , though a closer examination renders the account doubtful . His public works projects included the unification of diverse state walls into a single Great Wall of China and a massive new national road system , as well as the city-sized mausoleum guarded by the life-sized Terracotta Army . He ruled until his death in 210 BC during his fourth tour of Eastern China .",
