  "/wiki/Alain_Resnais": "Alain Resnais ( French : [ al\u025b\u0303 \u0281\u025bn\u025b ] ; 3 June 1922 - 1 March 2014 ) was a French film director and screenwriter whose career extended over more than six decades . After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s , he went on to direct a number of short films which included Night and Fog ( 1956 ) , an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps . Resnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and consolidated his early reputation with Hiroshima mon amour ( 1959 ) , Last Year at Marienbad ( 1961 ) , and Muriel ( 1963 ) , all of which adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of troubled memory and the imagined past . These films were contemporary with , and associated with , the French New Wave ( la nouvelle vague ) , though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement . He had closer links to the Left Bank group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left-wing politics . He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol , Marguerite Duras , Alain Robbe-Grillet , Jorge Sempr\u00fan and Jacques Sternberg . In later films , Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms , including theatre , music , and comic books . This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn , Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh , as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song . His films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness , memory , and the imagination , and he was noted for devising innovative formal structures for his narratives . Throughout his career , he won many awards from international film festivals and academies .",

His work is noted for its improvisation , loose narratives , and lengthy running times . Inspired by Jean Cocteau to become a filmmaker , Rivette shot his first short film at age twenty . He moved to Paris to pursue his career , frequenting Henri Langlois ' Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise and other cin\u00e9-clubs ; there , he met Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut , Jean-Luc Godard , \u00c9ric Rohmer , Claude Chabrol and other future members of the New Wave . Rivette began writing film criticism , and was hired by Andr\u00e9 Bazin for Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma in 1953 . In his criticism , he expressed an admiration for American films - especially those of genre directors such as John Ford , Alfred Hitchcock and Nicholas Ray - and was deeply critical of mainstream French cinema . Rivette 's articles , admired by his peers , were considered the magazine 's best and most aggressive writings , particularly his 1961 article On Abjection and his influential series of interviews with film directors co-written with Truffaut . He continued making short films , including Le Coup de Berger , which is often cited as the first New Wave film . Truffaut later credited Rivette with developing the movement . Although he was the first New Wave director to begin work on a feature film , Paris Belongs to Us was not released until 1961 , by which time Chabrol , Truffaut and Godard released their own first features and popularised the movement worldwide .
