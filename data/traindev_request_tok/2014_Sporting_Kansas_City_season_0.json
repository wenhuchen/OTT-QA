  "/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)": "The goalkeeper , often shortened to keeper or goalie , is one of the major positions of association football . It is the most specialised position in the sport . The goalkeeper 's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring ( moving the ball over the defended goal-line within the frame of the goal ) . This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line . Within the penalty area goalkeepers are able to use their hands , making them ( outside throw-ins ) the only players on the field permitted to handle the ball . The special status of goalkeepers is indicated by them wearing different coloured kits from their teammates . The back-pass rule prevents goalkeepers handling direct passes back to them from teammates . Goalkeepers usually perform goal kicks , and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks , direct and indirect free kicks , and marking . Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch , giving them a unique perspective on play development . The goalkeeper is the only required position of a team . If they are injured or sent off , a substitute goalkeeper has to take their place , otherwise an outfield player must take the ejected keeper 's place in goal . In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off , a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper ( thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players ) .",

  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/Homegrown_Player_Rule_(Major_League_Soccer)": "The Homegrown Player Rule is a Major League Soccer program that allows MLS teams to sign local players from their own development academies directly to MLS first team rosters . Before the creation of the rule in 2008 , every player entering Major League Soccer would have to be assigned through one of the existing MLS player allocation processes , such as the MLS SuperDraft . MLS roster rules allow a team to sign players to contracts similar to Generation adidas contracts , which do not count against the MLS salary budget and may earn a much higher salary than the league minimum . MLS has since removed this wording from the roster rules . That means homegrown players will not count against the salary budget only if they are registered using supplemental roster slots , but will still count against the salary budget if they are registered using senior roster slots . There is , however , supplementary salary budget made by MLS only for homegrown players that are registered using senior roster slots called homegrown player funds . To place a player on its homegrown player list , making him eligible to sign as a homegrown player , players must have resided in that club 's home territory and participated in the club 's youth development system for at least one year , as well as meeting other unspecified league requirements . If a player on a team 's homegrown list goes to college or U17 , U20 , and U23 United States men 's national soccer teams , he remains eligible to sign as a homegrown player at any time as long as he is registered with the club as a homegrown player first . In 2014 , Seattle 's DeAndre Yedlin became the first MLS Homegrown player to compete in a World Cup .",

  "/wiki/Designated_Player_Rule": "The Designated Player Rule , nicknamed the Beckham Rule , allows Major League Soccer franchises to sign up to three players that would be considered outside their salary cap ( either by offering the player higher wages or by paying a transfer fee for the player ) . The rule , which was adopted ahead of the 2007 MLS season , enables teams to compete for star players in the international soccer market . The rule is one of two mechanisms by which MLS teams may exceed their salary cap , the other being allocation money . As of December 2019 , there have been 209 Designated Players in league history . The rule is informally named after David Beckham , in anticipation of MLS teams signing lucrative deals with internationally recognized players of Beckham 's caliber . Beckham was the first player signed under this rule , signing a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy with a guaranteed annual salary of $ 6.5 million .",
  "/wiki/Midfielder": "A midfielder is an association football position . Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team 's defenders and forwards . Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role , breaking up attacks , and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders . Others blur the boundaries , being more mobile and efficient in passing : they are commonly referred to as deep-lying midfielders , play-makers , box-to-box , or holding midfielders . The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team 's formation ; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield . Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team 's attacks , while others may be tasked with creating goals , or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence . Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match . Because midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game they are among the fittest players on the pitch .",

The program , sponsored by Adidas , offers professional-ready players in the U.S. developmental system not yet eligible for the MLS SuperDraft early entry , allowing MLS to compete with foreign professional clubs without comparable restrictions on player signing . From its establishment in 1997 to 2005 , the program was sponsored by Nike and was called Project-40 . Originally intended to improve the U.S. national team player pool , American national team eligibility is no longer required for program entry . Carlos Parra was the first Project-40 player when he signed with the league and was allocated to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in 1997 . Since then , the program has included players such as Tim Howard , DaMarcus Beasley , Maurice Edu , Carlos Bocanegra , Clint Dempsey , Jozy Altidore , Ben Olsen , Sacha Kljestan , Freddy Adu , Brad Guzan , Michael Bradley , Nick Rimando and Kyle Beckerman . Generation Adidas players do not count against the MLS senior roster and usually earn a much higher salary than the league minimum . Entering into the program automatically classifies a player as professional , and thus disqualifies them from playing college soccer . As a result , Generation Adidas players are also guaranteed scholarships to continue their college education should their professional career not pan out . From 1998 to 2000 , MLS entered a team of Project-40 players , supplemented by other MLS players who did not get much playing time , into the A-League in the USL .
