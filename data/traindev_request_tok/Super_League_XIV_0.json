Bradford became a municipal borough in 1847 , and received its charter as a city in 1897 . Following local government reform in 1974 , city status was bestowed upon the City of Bradford metropolitan borough . Bradford forms part of the West Yorkshire Urban Area , which in 2001 had a population of 1.5 million and is the fourth largest in the United Kingdom . Bradford itself has a population of 529,870 , which makes it the seventh-largest city in the United Kingdom and the third-largest city in Yorkshire and the Humber after Leeds and Sheffield . Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire , Bradford rose to prominence in the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture , particularly wool . It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution , and amongst the earliest industrialised settlements , rapidly becoming the wool capital of the world . The area 's access to a supply of coal , iron ore and soft water facilitated the growth of Bradford 's manufacturing base , which , as textile manufacture grew , led to an explosion in population and was a stimulus to civic investment ; Bradford has a large amount of listed Victorian architecture including the grand Italianate City Hall . The textile sector in Bradford fell into decline from the mid-20th century . Bradford has since emerged as a tourist destination , becoming the first UNESCO City of Film with attractions such as the National Science and Media Museum , Bradford City Park , the Alhambra theatre and Cartwright Hall . Bradford has faced similar challenges to the rest of post-industrial Northern England , including deindustrialisation , social unrest and economic deprivation .",

In 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888 , administrative counties with a county council were created on the historic boundaries . In 1974 both the Local Government Area and the Lieutenancy of the East Riding of Yorkshire were abolished under the Local Government Act 1972 , being succeeded in most of the riding by the newly created Humberside which included parts of the West Riding and parts of Lincolnshire . The modern Local Government Area and the ceremonial East Riding of Yorkshire were formed in 1996 from the northern part of Humberside upon its abolition . At the 2011 Census , the population was 334,179 .

There is a mix of high-density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester , but land use is mostly urban - the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry . It has a focused central business district , formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford , but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . Greater Manchester is governed by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority ( GMCA ) , which consists of political leaders from each of the ten metropolitan borough councils , plus a directly elected mayor , with responsibility for economic development , regeneration and transport . Andy Burnham is the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester , elected in 2017 . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986 , and so its districts ( the metropolitan boroughs ) effectively became unitary authority areas . However , the metropolitan county continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county , with a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff .",
