  "/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Cambodia": "The figures listed in the table below come from the 2018 Commune Database ( CDB ) published by the National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development ( NCDD ) . These data are recorded differently to Cambodian census data and significant variations are to be expected between the two due to internal and external migration . The national census does not record population by city , rather by province . The only available method of estimating the population of a city is through the CDB , which is updated every two years . For instance , the 2018 CDB suggests that 1,474,489 people were living in Phnom Penh municipality , whereas the 2019 census ( which only preliminary results have been released for ) suggests 2,129,371 . The figures listed in the table below are based on the most recently published Commune Database . However , it should be expected that the population in Phnom Penh and other major urban centres , such as Siem Reap , Battambang , and Preah Sihanouk will be underestimated ; while the population in smaller provincial municipalities , particularly those on the border with Thailand , Laos and Vietnam , will be overestimated . The most accurate information is available in the 2019 census , which provides information on the 'de-facto ' population i.e . the precise population at the time the census was recorded , rather than official data recorded in Commune offices . To date , no information dis-aggregated by city is available from any census . It should also be noted that the size of municipal populations is based upon the municipal area and there are other smaller urbanized towns in Cambodia with significant populations , which are part of larger districts , such as Poipet in Banteay Meanchey province . It is not really possible to estimate the population of these urban areas using the CDB .",
  "/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Cambodia": "Administrative divisions of Cambodia have several levels . Cambodia is divided into 24 provinces ( Khmer : \u1781\u17c1\u178f\u17d2\u178f , khaet ) and the special administrative unit Phnom Penh ( Khmer : \u1797\u17d2\u1793\u17c6\u1796\u17c1\u1789 , Phnom Penh ) .

The province extends from the mountains of the Annamite Range in the north , across a hilly plateau between the Tonle San and Tonle Srepok rivers , to tropical deciduous forests in the south . In recent years , logging and mining have scarred Ratanakiri 's environment , long known for its beauty . For over a millennium , Ratanakiri has been occupied by the highland Khmer Loeu people , who are a minority elsewhere in Cambodia . During the region 's early history , its Khmer Loeu inhabitants were exploited as slaves by neighboring empires . The slave trade economy ended during the French colonial era , but a harsh Khmerization campaign after Cambodia 's independence again threatened Khmer Loeu ways of life . The Khmer Rouge built its headquarters in the province in the 1960s , and bombing during the Vietnam War devastated the region . Today , rapid development in the province is altering traditional ways of life . Ratanakiri is sparsely populated ; its 184,000 residents make up just over 1% of the country 's total population . Residents generally live in villages of 20 to 60 families and engage in subsistence shifting agriculture . Ratanakiri is among the least developed provinces of Cambodia .",

  "/wiki/Battambang": "Battambang was established as an important trading city with around 2,500 residents in the 18th century . The population was centred along a single road parallel to the Sangkae River ( Stung Sangkae ) . In 1795 Siam ( modern-day Thailand ) annexed much of north western Cambodia including the current provinces of Banteay Meanchey , Battambang , Oddar Meanchey , Pailin , and Siem Reap into the province of Inner Cambodia . The Siamese ruled Battambang as a provincial capital through the Thai-speaking Khmer Aphaiwong family , a branch of the Khmer royal family , which governed for six generations until 1907 when the province was ceded to the French to be reunited with Cambodia as part of the French Indochina colony . Following colonization by the French , an urban layout was developed which resulted in an enlarged French colonial town . This first attempt at modernization resulted in well-defined streets laid in a grid pattern , building of urban structures and three main streets parallel to the Sangkae River , and the linking of both banks by the construction of two bridges in 1917 . Military and prison facilities were also erected . Nineteen years later , a second urban development plan was implemented with a newly constructed railway linking Battambang to Phnom Penh . The urban structures were extended to the west of the town creating urban hubs oriented around the railway station . The large residential villas and public buildings built during this period of French development significantly changed the landscape of the previously remote city . A subsequent third urban development plan for Battambang involved the north , east and south of the city . This vast undertaking , which required long-term planning to integrate all of the previous work , resulted in a modern provincial capital that was by far the most developed region of Cambodia outside of Phnom Penh .",
