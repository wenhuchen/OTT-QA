  "/wiki/Medal_of_Honor": "The Medal of Honor is the United States of America 's highest and most prestigious personal military decoration that may be awarded to recognize U.S. military service members who have distinguished themselves by acts of valor . The medal is normally awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress . Because the medal is presented in the name of Congress , it is often referred erroneously as the Congressional Medal of Honor . However , the official name of the current award is Medal of Honor . Within the United States Code the medal is referred to as the Medal of Honor , and less frequently as Congressional Medal of Honor . U.S. awards , including the Medal of Honor , do not have post-nominal titles , and while there is no official abbreviation , the most common abbreviations are MOH and MH . There are three versions of the medal , one each for the Army , Navy and Air Force . Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version while members of the Space Force receive the Air Force version . The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861 , soon followed by an Army version in 1862 . The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States ' armed forces . The President typically presents the Medal at a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the U.S. people , with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin . According to the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States , there have been 3,525 Medals of Honor awarded to 3,506 individuals since the decoration 's creation , with over 40% awarded for actions during the American Civil War .",

The disappearance of the sergeant in the title explains the apparently confusing phenomenon whereby a lieutenant general outranks a major general while a major outranks a lieutenant . In the Commonwealth and the United States , it is a division commander 's rank subordinate to the rank of lieutenant general and senior to the ranks of brigadier and brigadier general . In the Commonwealth , major general is equivalent to the navy rank of rear admiral , and in air forces with a separate rank structure , it is equivalent to air vice-marshal .

It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services , and is designated as the Army of the United States in the U.S. Constitution . As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence , the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army , which was formed ( 14 June 1775 ) to fight the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) - before the United States of America was established as a country . After the Revolutionary War , the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army . The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army , and considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775 . As a uniformed military service , the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army , which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant , the secretary of the Army ( SECARMY ) and by a chief military officer , the chief of staff of the Army ( CSA ) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It is the largest military branch , and in the fiscal year 2017 , the projected end strength for the Regular Army ( USA ) was 476,000 soldiers ; the Army National Guard ( ARNG ) had 343,000 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve ( USAR ) had 199,000 soldiers ; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers . As a branch of the armed forces , the mission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation 's wars , by providing prompt , sustained land dominance , across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict , in support of combatant commanders . The branch participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force of the United States .",

  "/wiki/Admiral": "Admiral is one of the highest ranks in some navies , and in many navies is the highest rank . The rank is generally thought to have originated in Sicily from a conflation of Arabic : \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631 , am\u012br al-ba\u1e25r , prince in Arabic ; supervisor in Turkic ; ( commander ) of the sea , with Latin admirabilis ( admirable ) or admiratus ( admired ) , although alternative etymologies derive the word directly from Latin , or from the Turkish military and naval rank miralay . The French version - amiral without the additional d - tends to add evidence for the Arab origin . In the Commonwealth nations and the United States , a full admiral is equivalent to a full general in the army , and is above vice admiral and below admiral of the fleet , or fleet admiral .

The term sergeant refers to a non-commissioned officer placed above the rank of a corporal and a police officer immediately below a lieutenant or , in the UK Police forces , below an inspector . In most armies the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a squad ( or section ) . In Commonwealth armies , it is a more senior rank , corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command . In the United States Army , sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a four-soldier fireteam leader . More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant , for example staff sergeant , first sergeant , and sergeant major .

Meyer ( ret ) . The 101st Airborne is able to plan , coordinate , and execute brigade-size air assault operations capable of seizing key terrain in support of operational objectives , and is capable of working in austere environments with limited or degraded infrastructure . These particular operations are conducted by highly mobile teams covering extensive distances and engaging enemy forces behind enemy lines . According to the author of Screaming Eagles : 101st Airborne Division , its unique battlefield mobility and high level of training have kept it in the vanguard of US land combat forces in recent conflicts . More recently , the 101st Airborne has been performing foreign internal defense and counterterrorism operations within Iraq and Afghanistan . The 101st Airborne Division has a history that is nearly a century long . During World War II , it was renowned for its role in Operation Overlord ( the D-Day landings and airborne landings on 6 June 1944 , in Normandy , France ) , Operation Market Garden , the liberation of the Netherlands and its action during the Battle of the Bulge around the city of Bastogne , Belgium . During the Vietnam War , the 101st Airborne Division fought in several major campaigns and battles , including the Battle of Hamburger Hill in May 1969 .

  "/wiki/Lieutenant_General": "Lieutenant general , lieutenant-general and similar ( abbrev Lt Gen , LTG and similar ) is a three-star military rank ( NATO code OF-8 ) used in many countries . The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages , where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield , who was normally subordinate to a captain general . In modern armies , lieutenant general normally ranks immediately below general and above major general ; it is equivalent to the navy rank of vice admiral , and in air forces with a separate rank structure , it is equivalent to air marshal . A lieutenant general commands an army corps , made up of typically three army divisions , and consisting of around 60,000-70,000 soldiers ( U.S. ) . The seeming incongruity that a lieutenant general outranks a major general ( whereas a major outranks a lieutenant ) is due to the derivation of the former rank from sergeant major general , which was also subordinate to lieutenant general . In some countries ( e.g . France and Italy ) , the ranks of corps general or lieutenant colonel general are used instead of lieutenant general , in an attempt to solve this apparent anomaly - these ranks are often translated into English as lieutenant general . [ citation needed ] However , some countries of Latin America such as Brazil and Chile use divisional general as the equivalent of lieutenant general . In addition , because no brigadier general rank is used in Japan , lieutenant general is the rank of divisional commander . Therefore , it corresponds to divisional general of these countries . In a number of smaller states which employ NATO and western style military organizational structures , because of the limited number of soldiers in their armies , the rank of lieutenant general is the highest army rank in use .

It originated from the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the Royal Navy . Each naval squadron would be assigned an admiral as its head , who would command from the centre vessel and direct the activities of the squadron . The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral , who commanded the lead ships which would bear the brunt of a naval battle . In the rear of the naval squadron , a third admiral would command the remaining ships and , as this section of the squadron was considered to be in the least danger , the admiral in command of the rear would typically be the most junior of the squadron admirals .
