  "/wiki/Peerage_of_Scotland": "The Peerage of Scotland ( Scottish Gaelic : Moraireachd na h-Alba , Scots : Peerage o Scotland ) is the section of the Peerage of the British Isles for those peers created by the King of Scots before 1707 . Following that year 's Treaty of Union , the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England were combined under the name of Great Britain , and a new Peerage of Great Britain was introduced in which subsequent titles were created . After the Union , the Peers of the ancient Parliament of Scotland elected 16 representative peers to sit in the House of Lords . The Peerage Act 1963 granted all Scottish Peers the right to sit in the House of Lords , but this automatic right was revoked , as for all hereditary peerages ( except those of the incumbent Earl Marshal and Lord Great Chamberlain ) , when the House of Lords Act 1999 received royal assent . Had the Scottish people voted Yes in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum , the eligibility of Peers of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords would have been reviewed . Unlike most peerages , many Scottish titles have been granted with remainder to pass via female offspring ( thus an Italian family has succeeded to and presently holds the earldom of Newburgh ) , and in the case of daughters only , these titles devolve to the eldest daughter rather than falling into abeyance ( as is the case with ancient English baronies by writ of summons ) . Unlike other British peerage titles , Scots Law permits peerages to be inherited by or through a person who was not legitimate at birth , but was subsequently legitimised by their parents marrying later . The ranks of the Scottish Peerage are , in ascending order : Lord of Parliament , Viscount , Earl , Marquis and Duke . Scottish Viscounts differ from those of the other Peerages ( of England , Great Britain , Ireland and the United Kingdom ) by using the style of in their title , as in Viscount of Oxfuird .

  "/wiki/Baron_Wharton": "Baron Wharton is a title in the Peerage of England , originally granted by letters patent to the heirs male of the 1st Baron , which was forfeited in 1729 when the last male-line heir was declared an outlaw .

As such , the current Barony of Wharton could more accurately be listed as a new Barony , created in 1916 , with the precedence of the older ( and extinct ) Barony .",
  "/wiki/Peerage_of_Ireland": "The Peerage of Ireland consists of those titles of nobility created by the English monarchs in their capacity as lord or king of Ireland , or later by monarchs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland .

As of 2016 , there were 135 titles in the Peerage of Ireland extant : two dukedoms , ten marquessates , 43 earldoms , 28 viscountcies , and 52 baronies .

Article 40.2 of the Irish Constitution forbids the state conferring titles of nobility and a citizen may not accept titles of nobility or honour except with the prior approval of the Government . As stated above , this issue does not arise in respect of the Peerage of Ireland , as no creations of titles in it have been made since the Constitution came into force .

Since the 14th century , the title has been a dynastic title granted to the heir apparent to the English or British monarch , but the failure to be granted the title does not affect the rights to royal succession . The title is granted to the heir apparent as a personal honour or dignity , and is not heritable , merging with the Crown on accession to the throne . The title Earl of Chester is always given in conjunction with that of Prince of Wales . The Prince of Wales usually has other titles and honours . The current and longest-serving Prince of Wales is Prince Charles , the eldest son of Elizabeth II , who is Queen of the United Kingdom and 15 other independent Commonwealth realms as well as Head of the 53-member Commonwealth of Nations . The wife of the Prince of Wales is entitled to the title Princess of Wales .
