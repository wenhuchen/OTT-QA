  "/wiki/King_Kelly": "Michael Joseph King Kelly ( December 31 , 1857 - November 8 , 1894 ) , also commonly known as $ 10,000 Kelly , was an American outfielder , catcher , and manager in various professional American baseball leagues including the National League , International Association , Players ' League , and the American Association . He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career with the Chicago White Stockings and the Boston Beaneaters . Kelly was a player-manager three times in his career - in 1887 for the Beaneaters , in 1890 leading the Boston Reds to the pennant in the only season of the Players ' League 's existence , and in 1891 for the Cincinnati Kelly 's Killers - before his retirement in 1893 . He is also often credited with helping to popularize various strategies as a player such as the hit and run , the hook slide , and the catcher 's practice of backing up first base . In only the second vote since its creation in 1939 , the Old Timers Committee ( now the Veterans ' Committee ) elected Kelly to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 . In concluding where to truly give Kelly credit as an innovator , a 2004 book devoted to 19th-century rule bending in baseball - and which came close to exhaustively accounting for all contemporary reporting on various subjects - placed stress on the following : Kelly 's hook slide does sound special , and players probably tried to copy it . Also , he seems to have been the first big leaguer to successfully cut a base ( when the usually lone umpire was n't looking ) , at least according to the newspaper record . And , Kelly could have been the first to foul off lots of pitches on purpose . Doing so was a top trick of some Baltimore players of the 1890s . At the turn of the century , that trick was defused when all foul balls began counting as strikes . Kelly 's autobiography Play Ball was published while he was with the Beaneaters in 1888 , the first autobiography by a baseball player ; it was ghostwritten by Boston baseball writer John J. Jack Drohan . Kelly also became a vaudeville performer during his playing career , first performing in Boston where he would recite the now-famous baseball poem Casey at the Bat , sometimes butchering it .",
