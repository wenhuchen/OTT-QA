The kun suffix after his name is an informal Japanese honorific usually applied to young males . The series originated in the arcades and the Famicom console ; its title and its protagonist , Kunio ( variously renamed Alex and Crash Cooney in the United States ) , were named after Techn\u014ds Japan 's former president , Kunio Taki . Along with that , Kunio also later became Techn\u014ds Japan 's main mascot , appearing on the company 's logo in several games and television commercials . Although the original game was created by Yoshihisa Kishimoto - who later designed Double Dragon - many of the later games ( particularly those under the Downtown Nekketsu moniker ) were the handiwork of two men : Mitsuhiro Yoshimitsu Yoshida and Hiroyuki Mokeke Sekimoto . A few of the early Kunio games for the NES were localized for the North American market . These include Renegade , River City Ransom , Super Dodge Ball , Crash ' n ' the Boys : Street Challenge and Nintendo World Cup , which were heavily Americanized versions of the Kunio-kun games . Techn\u014ds Japan has released over twenty Kunio-kun titles for the Famicom , Game Boy , and Super Famicom in Japan .
