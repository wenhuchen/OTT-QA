For most of its history , Gwadar was a small to medium-sized settlement with an economy largely based on artisanal fishing . The strategic value of its location was first recognized in 1954 when it was identified as a suitable site for a deep water port by the United States Geological Survey at the request of Pakistan while the territory was still under Omani rule . The area 's potential to be a major deep water port remained untapped under successive Pakistani governments until 2001 , when construction on the first phase of Gwadar Port was initiated . The first phase was inaugurated by General Parvez Musharraf in 2007 at a total cost of $ 248 million . The port initially remained underutilized after construction for a variety of reasons , including lack of investment , security concerns , and the Government of Pakistan 's failure to transfer land as promised to the port operator , Port of Singapore Authority . In April 2015 , Pakistan and China announced their intention to develop the $ 46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) , which in turn forms part of China 's ambitious One Belt , One Road . Gwadar features heavily in CPEC , and is also envisaged to be the link between the One Belt , One Road and Maritime Silk Road project . $ 1.153 billion worth of infrastructure projects will be invested into the city as part of CPEC , with the aim of linking northern Pakistan and western China to the deep water seaport .",
