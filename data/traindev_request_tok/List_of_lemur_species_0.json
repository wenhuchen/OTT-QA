  "/wiki/Hairy-eared_dwarf_lemur": "The hairy-eared dwarf lemur ( Allocebus trichotis ) , or hairy-eared mouse lemur , is one of the most scarcely known lemurs . A. trichotis is a nocturnal lemur that is endemic to Madagascar . It was originally named by Dr. Albert G\u00fcnther in 1875 as Cheirogaleus trichotis as part of the Cheirogaleidae family , or the dwarf lemurs . However , in 1967 Petter-Rousseaux and Petter reassigned the lemur to its own genus and is the now only member of the genus Allocebus . The hairy-eared dwarf lemur was thought to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1989 in a northeastern primary lowland rainforest . The population of these mammals is shown to be severely decreasing and largely fragmented throughout Northern and Eastern Madagascar rainforests ; most likely due to hunting , trapping , slash-and-burn agriculture as well as habitat fragmentation .",

  "/wiki/Vulnerable_species": "A vulnerable species is one which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as likely to become endangered unless the circumstances that are threatening its survival and reproduction improve . Vulnerability is mainly caused by habitat loss or destruction of the species home . Vulnerable habitat or species are monitored and can become increasingly threatened . Some species listed as vulnerable may be common in captivity , an example being the military macaw . There are currently 5196 animals and 6789 plants classified as vulnerable , compared with 1998 levels of 2815 and 3222 , respectively . Practices such as Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources have been enforced in efforts to conserve vulnerable breeds of livestock specifically .",

  "/wiki/Alfred_Grandidier": "Alfred Grandidier ( 20 December 1836 - 13 September 1921 ) was a French naturalist and explorer . From a very wealthy family , at the age of 20 , he and his brother , Ernest Grandidier ( 1833-1912 ) , undertook a voyage around the world . At first they were led by the astronomer and physicist Pierre Jules C\u00e9sar Janssen ( 1824-1907 ) , but when Janssen fell sick and had to return to France after about six months , the brothers continued the journey . They visited South America in 1858 and 1859 and in particular the Andes , Peru , Chile , Bolivia , Argentina and Brazil . During this voyage they gathered a significant collection of specimens which were analyzed , in 1860 , by Ernest . The two brothers parted ways after this . Ernest Grandidier went to China and collected a vast number of specimens which are now in the Louvre and the Guimet museum . Alfred travelled to India , reaching it in 1863 . He had intended to explore the high plateau of Tibet , but was prevented by a severe attack of fever . Grandidier travelled to Zanzibar to recuperate , remaining some time and making important collections and publishing an account of his findings . He then visited the island of R\u00e9union and in 1865 made his first visit to Madagascar . He became devoted to the study of the island , revisiting in 1866 and 1868 .",
  "/wiki/Data_Deficient": "A data deficient ( DD ) species is one which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) as offering insufficient information for a proper assessment of conservation status to be made . This does not necessarily indicate that the species has not been extensively studied ; but it does indicate that little or no information is available on the abundance and distribution of the species . The IUCN recommends that care be taken to avoid classing species as data deficient when the absence of records may indicate dangerously low abundance : If the range of a taxon is suspected to be relatively circumscribed , if a considerable period of time has elapsed since the last record of the taxon , threatened status may well be justified ( see also precautionary principle ) .",
  "/wiki/Groves'_dwarf_lemur": "Groves ' dwarf lemur ( Cheirogaleus grovesi ) is a species of dwarf lemur known from Ranomafana and Andringitra national parks and surrounding areas in southeastern Madagascar . The identification was based on comparison of mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences with other members of the C. crossleyi group ( C. andysabini , C. crossleyi , C. lavasoensis and an unnamed possible new species , CCS2 ) . Individuals from this clade first came under genetic study in 1999 and were recognized as a new species in 2014 , but it was not formally described until 2017 . The lemur was named after mammalologist Colin Groves . Known from altitudes from 754 to 999 m , it is significantly larger than other members of the C. crossleyi group , with a 20 cm body length , a 29 cm tail , and a weight of 0.41 kg . While the conservation status of the new species has not yet been assessed , its presence in several national parks does not guarantee that it will not be threatened by deforestation ongoing on the island , or possibly by hunting .",

Species can not be assigned the Least Concern category unless they have had their population status evaluated . That is , adequate information is needed to make a direct , or indirect , assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution or population status . Since 2001 the category has had the abbreviation LC , following the IUCN 2001 Categories & Criteria ( version 3.1 ) . However , around 20% of least concern taxa ( 3261 of 15636 ) in the IUCN database use the code LR/lc , which indicates they have not been re-evaluated since 2000 . Before 2001 least concern was a subcategory of the Lower Risk category and assigned the code LR/lc or lc .

It is nocturnal and an arboreal quadruped , and is not very agile . It produces three types of vocalisation : a squeak , which is high in pitch and is produced with the mouth closed , and is used between infants and their mothers ; a whistle , which is higher in pitch than the squeak , so it is hard to hear with human ears , and is used as a communicative and possibly territorial call ; and a grunt , which is usually given in series and is very powerful , used when an individual is being attacked in its nest . This species is only known to exist from one museum specimen from Ambositra , north of Fianarantsoa in east-central Madagascar . As of 2010 , no studies in the wild have been conducted of the lesser iron-gray dwarf lemur , and it is unknown whether it still survives in this region .

He graduated in medicine at Basel in 1868 and became a physician in Florence , Italy . Like many early naturalists he spent his free time studying fossil mammals . His first publication was on fossil primates in 1872 . The Italian government supported him in 1877 and he collected fossils from Calabria , Corsica , Sardinia , and Sicily . In 1886 , he stopped practising as a physician and began to study fossils in the Greek Archipelago with his collections going to the College Galliard at Lausanne and to the British Museum ( Natural History ) . In the British Museum collections he took a keen interest in material from Madagascar . He studied the lemur fauna , both extant and extinct , discovered the new family Megaladapidae ( Major 1893 ) , genus and species of the extinct giant lemur Megaladapis madagascariensis ( Major 1893 ) , and five new species in the genera Lepilemur and Cheirogaleus . This led to a keen interest in Madagascar and initiated an expedition to it . His field trip was funded by The Royal Society along with funds from Lionel Walter Rothschild , F. DuCane Godman , Sir Henry Peek and himself . The expedition started from Britain on 15 July 1894 and returned on 30 August 1896 .",
