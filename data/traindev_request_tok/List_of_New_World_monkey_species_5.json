  "/wiki/Coiba_Island_howler": "The Coiba Island howler ( Alouatta coibensis ) is a species of howler monkey , a type of New World monkey , endemic to Panama . Although the Coiba Island howler is generally recognized as a separate species , mitochondrial DNA testing is inconclusive as to whether it is actually a subspecies of the mantled howler . The reason for treating it as a separate species is the dermal ridges of its hands and feet differ from those of the mantled howler . A. c. coibensis is smaller than other Central American howler monkeys and has duller pelage than the Azuero howler , Alouatta coibensis trabeata .",

  "/wiki/Mantled_howler": "The mantled howler ( Alouatta palliata ) , or golden-mantled howling monkey , is a species of howler monkey , a type of New World monkey , from Central and South America . It is one of the monkey species most often seen and heard in the wild in Central America . It takes its mantled name from the long guard hairs on its sides . The mantled howler is one of the largest Central American monkeys , and males can weigh up to 9.8 kg ( 22 lb ) . It is the only Central American monkey that eats large quantities of leaves ; it has several adaptations to this folivorous diet . Since leaves are difficult to digest and provide less energy than most foods , the mantled howler spends the majority of each day resting and sleeping . The male mantled howler has an enlarged hyoid bone , a hollow bone near the vocal cords , which amplifies the calls made by the male , and is the reason for the name howler . Howling allows the monkeys to locate each other without expending energy on moving or risking physical confrontation . The mantled howler lives in groups that can have over 40 members , although groups are usually smaller . Most mantled howlers of both sexes are evicted from the group they were born in upon reaching sexual maturity , resulting in most adult group members being unrelated . The most dominant male , the alpha male , gets preference for food and resting places , and mates with most of the receptive females . The mantled howler is important to the rainforest ecology as a seed disperser and germinator .",
  "/wiki/John_Edward_Gray": "John Edward Gray , FRS ( 12 February 1800 - 7 March 1875 ) was a British zoologist . He was the elder brother of zoologist George Robert Gray and son of the pharmacologist and botanist Samuel Frederick Gray ( 1766-1828 ) . The standard author abbreviation J.E.Gray is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name . The same is used for a zoological name . Gray was keeper of zoology at the British Museum in London from 1840 until Christmas 1874 , before the natural history holdings were split off to the Natural History Museum . He published several catalogues of the museum collections that included comprehensive discussions of animal groups and descriptions of new species . He improved the zoological collections to make them amongst the best in the world .",

  "/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt": "Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt ( 14 September 1769 - 6 May 1859 ) was a Prussian polymath , geographer , naturalist , explorer , and proponent of Romantic philosophy and science . He was the younger brother of the Prussian minister , philosopher , and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt ( 1767-1835 ) . Humboldt 's quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography . Humboldt 's advocacy of long-term systematic geophysical measurement laid the foundation for modern geomagnetic and meteorological monitoring . Between 1799 and 1804 , Humboldt travelled extensively in the Americas , exploring and describing them for the first time from a modern scientific point of view . His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years . Humboldt was one of the first people to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined ( South America and Africa in particular ) . Humboldt resurrected the use of the word cosmos from the ancient Greek and assigned it to his multivolume treatise , Kosmos , in which he sought to unify diverse branches of scientific knowledge and culture . This important work also motivated a holistic perception of the universe as one interacting entity . He was the first person to describe the phenomenon and cause of human-induced climate change , in 1800 and again in 1831 , based on observations generated during his travels .",

He is known as the father of modern taxonomy . Many of his writings were in Latin , and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us ( after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9 ) . Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730 . He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738 , where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands . He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala . In the 1740s , he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals . In the 1750s and 1760s , he continued to collect and classify animals , plants , and minerals , while publishing several volumes . He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death . Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message : Tell him I know no greater man on earth . Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote : With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza , I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly .",

He was head of the Vertebrate Department of the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet ( Swedish Natural History Museum ) from 1904 to 1933 . In 1891 he obtained his PhD from the University of Uppsala , spending the next twelve years as an inspector in the fisheries service . During this time-frame he made scientific trips to Florida ( 1892 - 1893 ) and the Caspian Sea ( 1899 ) . In 1904 he was appointed head of the department of vertebrates at the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet in Stockholm . In 1910 - 1911 he participated in an expedition to East Africa . From 1925 to 1942 he served as prefect of the Kristineberg Marina Forskningsstation ( Kristineberg Marine Zoological Station ) . In regard to his zoological research , his primary focus dealt with mammals , birds and fish , but he also made significant contributions in his studies of reptiles and amphibians . He was the binomial authority of numerous taxa , and has several species named after him , such as Onykia loennbergii ( Japanese hooked squid ) . The Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger named a small , secretive , venomous , endemic New Guinea elapid snake Apisthocalamus loennbergii in his honour , although this species is now synonymised with Toxicocalamus loriae ( Loria 's forest snake ) . In his obituary in the ornithological journal , Ibis , it was written : that since the days of Linnaeus hardly anyone has known so much about so many branches of zoology as L\u00f6nnberg .",
