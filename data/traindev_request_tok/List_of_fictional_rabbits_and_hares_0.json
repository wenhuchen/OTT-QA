The books are the basis of a popular film series , over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts and was a producer on the final films . She also writes crime fiction under the name Robert Galbraith . Born in Yate , Gloucestershire , Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990 . The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother , birth of her first child , divorce from her first husband , and relative poverty until the first novel in the series , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , was published in 1997 . There were six sequels , of which the last , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , was released in 2007 . Since then , Rowling has written five books for adult readers : The Casual Vacancy ( 2012 ) and - under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith - the crime fiction Cormoran Strike series , which consists of The Cuckoo 's Calling ( 2013 ) , The Silkworm ( 2014 ) , Career of Evil ( 2015 ) , and Lethal White ( 2018 ) .

They are similar in size and form to rabbits and have similar herbivorous diets , but generally have longer ears and live solitarily or in pairs . Also unlike rabbits , their young are able to fend for themselves shortly after birth rather than emerging blind and helpless . Most are fast runners .

Five leporid species with hare in their common names are not considered true hares : the hispid hare ( Caprolagus hispidus ) , and four species known as red rock hares ( comprising Pronolagus ) .

At home , Mr. McGregor proudly presents the sack to his wife , but receives a sharp scolding when she discovers its actual content . Modern critical commentary varies . One critic points out that the faces of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or the position of a tail conveys what the faces lack .

A semi-formal garden of archways and flowerbeds in Wales at the home of her uncle and aunt became the background for the illustrations . In The Flopsy Bunnies , Benjamin Bunny and his cousin Flopsy are the parents of six young rabbits called simply The Flopsy Bunnies . The story concerns how the Flopsy Bunnies , while raiding a rubbish heap of rotting vegetables , fall asleep and are captured by Mr. McGregor who places them in a sack . While McGregor is distracted , the six are freed by Thomasina Tittlemouse , a woodmouse , and the sack filled with rotten vegetables by Benjamin and Flopsy . At home , Mr. McGregor proudly presents the sack to his wife , but receives a sharp scolding when she discovers its actual content . Modern critical commentary varies . One critic points out that the faces of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or the position of a tail conveys what the faces lack . One critic believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture and story letter to a child . Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created .",
  "/wiki/God": "In monotheistic thought , God is conceived of as the supreme being , creator deity , and principal object of faith . God is usually conceived as being omniscient ( all-knowing ) , omnipotent ( all-powerful ) , omnipresent ( all-present ) and as having an eternal and necessary existence . These attributes are used either in way of analogy or are taken literally . God is most often held to be incorporeal ( immaterial ) . Incorporeality and corporeality of God are related to conceptions of transcendence ( being outside nature ) and immanence ( being in nature ) of God , with positions of synthesis such as the immanent transcendence . Some religions describe God without reference to gender , while others or their translations use terminology that is gender-specific and gender-biased . God has been conceived as either personal or impersonal . In theism , God is the creator and sustainer of the universe , while in deism , God is the creator , but not the sustainer , of the universe . In pantheism , God is the universe itself . In atheism , there is an absence of belief in God . In agnosticism , the existence of God is deemed unknown or unknowable . God has also been conceived as the source of all moral obligation , and the greatest conceivable existent .",
