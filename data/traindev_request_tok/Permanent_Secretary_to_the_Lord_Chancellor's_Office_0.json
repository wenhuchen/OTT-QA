After serving as secretary to several more commissions , he was made Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor 's Office in 1915 . Schuster served in this position for 29 years under ten different Lord Chancellors , and with the contacts obtained thanks to his long tenure and his work outside the Office he became one of the most influential Permanent Secretaries of the 20th century . His influence over decisions within the Lord Chancellor 's Office and greater Civil Service led to criticism and suspicions that he was a power behind the throne , which culminated in a verbal attack by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Hewart in 1934 during a session of the House of Lords . Schuster retired in 1944 and was elevated to the peerage .
