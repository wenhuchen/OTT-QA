  "/wiki/South_Korea": "South Korea ( Korean : \ud55c\uad6d/\u97d3\u570b ; RR : Hanguk or literally \ub0a8\ud55c/\u5357\u97d3 ; RR : Namhan ) , officially the Republic of Korea ( Korean : \ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d/\u5927\u97d3\u6c11\u570b ; RR : Daehan Minguk ) is a country in East Asia , constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and sharing a land border with North Korea . The name Korea is derived from Goguryeo , which was one of the great powers in East Asia during its time , ruling most of the Korean Peninsula , Manchuria , parts of the Russian Far East and Inner Mongolia under Gwanggaeto the Great . Its capital , Seoul , is a major global city and half of South Korea 's over 51 million people live in the Seoul Capital Area , the fourth largest metropolitan economy in the world . The Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period . Its first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century BC . Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century , Korea was ruled by the Goryeo dynasty ( 918-1392 ) and the Joseon dynasty ( 1392-1897 ) . The succeeding Korean Empire was annexed into the Empire of Japan in 1910 . After World War II , Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S.-administered zones , with the latter becoming the Republic of Korea in August 1948 . In 1950 , a North Korean invasion began the Korean War and after its end in 1953 , the country 's economy began to soar , recording the fastest rise in average GDP per capita in the world between 1980 and 1990 . Authoritarian rule ended in 1987 and the country is now the most advanced democracy with the highest level of press freedom in Asia . South Korea is a member of the OECD 's Development Assistance Committee , the G20 and the Paris Club . South Korea is a highly developed country and the world 's 12th-largest economy by nominal GDP .",

The cartridges are not interchangeable . Both 40 mm cartridges use the High-Low Propulsion System . The less powerful 40\u00d746mm is used in hand-held weapons such as the M79 , M203 , and the multi-shot M32 MGL . The more powerful 40\u00d753mm is used in automatic grenade launchers mounted on tripods , vehicles or helicopters , such as the Mk 19 grenade launcher .

For this reason , it is designated as the 9mm Luger by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ' Institute ( SAAMI ) , and the 9 mm Luger by the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes \u00e0 Feu Portatives ( CIP ) . The name Parabellum is derived from the Latin : Si vis pacem , para bellum ( If you seek peace , prepare for war ) , which was the motto of DWM .

According to the 2014 edition of Cartridges of the World , the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum is the world 's most popular and widely used military handgun and submachine gun cartridge . In addition to being used by over 60% of police in the U.S. , Newsweek credits 9\u00d719mm Parabellum pistol sales with making semiautomatic pistols more popular than revolvers . The popularity of this cartridge can be attributed to the widely held conviction that it is effective in police and self-defense use . Its low cost and wide availability contribute to the caliber 's continuing popularity .",

[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/7.62\u00d751mm_NATO": "The 7.62\u00d751mm NATO ( official NATO nomenclature 7.62 NATO ) is a rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge developed in the 1950s as a standard for small arms among NATO countries . It should not be confused with the similarly named Russian 7.62\u00d754mmR cartridge , a slightly longer , rimmed cartridge . It was introduced in U.S. service in the M14 rifle and M60 machine gun in the late 1950s . The M14 was superseded in U.S. service as the infantry adopted the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO M16 rifle . However , the M14 and many other firearms that use the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO round remain in service , especially in the case of various marksman/sniper rifles , medium machine guns/general-purpose machine guns such as the M240 , and various rifles in use by special operations forces . The cartridge is used both by infantry and on mounted and crew-served weapons mounted to vehicles , aircraft and ships . Although not identical , the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO and the commercial .308 Winchester cartridges are similar enough that they can be loaded into rifles chambered for the other round , but the Winchester .308 cartridges are typically loaded to higher pressures than 7.62\u00d751mm NATO service cartridges . Even though the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ' Institute ( SAAMI ) does not consider it unsafe to fire the commercial round in weapons chambered for the NATO round , there is significant discussion about compatible chamber and muzzle pressures between the two cartridges based on powder loads and wall thicknesses on the military vs. commercial rounds .",

The M2 uses the much larger and much more powerful .50 BMG cartridge , which was developed alongside and takes its name from the gun itself ( BMG standing for Browning machine gun ) . It has been referred to as Ma Deuce , in reference to its M2 nomenclature . The design has had many specific designations ; the official US military designation for the current infantry type is Browning Machine Gun , Cal . .50 , M2 , HB , Flexible . It is effective against infantry , unarmored or lightly armored vehicles and boats , light fortifications and low-flying aircraft . The Browning .50 caliber machine gun has been used extensively as a vehicle weapon and for aircraft armament by the United States from the 1930s to the present . It was heavily used during World War II , the Korean War , the Vietnam War , the Falklands War , the Soviet-Afghan War , the Gulf War , the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan in the 2000s and 2010s . It is the primary heavy machine gun of NATO countries , and has been used by many other countries as well .

The .50 BMG cartridge is also used in long-range target and anti-materiel rifles , as well as other .50-caliber machine guns .
