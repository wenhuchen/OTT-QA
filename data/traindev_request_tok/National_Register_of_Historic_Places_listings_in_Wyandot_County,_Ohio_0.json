  "/wiki/Armstrong_Farm_(Crane_Township,_Wyandot_County,_Ohio)": "The Armstrong Farm , also known as the Reber Farm , is a historic farm complex near Upper Sandusky in Crane Township , Wyandot County , Ohio , United States . Known for its association with Thomas V. Reber , a longtime president of the Wyandot County Agricultural Society , it was built in 1830 . The farmhouse , which is the central building on the farmstead , is a vernacular structure built of brick with a gabled roof of shingles . The original foundation , constructed of dry stone , has been shored up by modern concrete , although the original foundation is still visible at certain points . Among the other buildings on the property are a small summer kitchen and two garages , located just south and west of the house . When the Armstrong Farm was founded , significant numbers of Wyandots still lived on a reservation in the vicinity of Upper Sandusky ; the farm 's early inhabitants were distinguished by their relations with the Wyandots . In 1986 , the Armstrong Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places . It qualified for inclusion because of its place in local history , because of its connection to the leading Reber and Armstrong families , and because of its unusually well-preserved historic architecture .",

  "/wiki/Col._Crawford_Burn_Site_Monument": "The Colonel Crawford Burn Site Monument is a war monument in rural Wyandot County , Ohio , United States . Placed in the 1870s , it commemorates the death by burning of Colonel William Crawford during the concluding years of the American Revolution . The stone monument itself was long the subject of local interest , and it has been named a historic site . As the end of the American Revolution approached , warfare continued in the backcountry of modern Ohio ; British-allied Indians continued to harass the American settlers . In 1782 , a regiment of Virginia soldiers was sent in reprisal to destroy Indian villages on the Sandusky River , under the command of William Crawford , a friend of victorious General George Washington . However , the Crawford expedition ended on June 4 after a skirmish south of modern-day Carey , and the Americans retreated . Colonel Crawford was captured by the Indians after the battle , and seven days later he was tortured and burned at the stake on the banks of Tymochtee Creek in present-day northeastern Wyandot County . As the centenary of the burning approached , a movement arose to commemorate Crawford 's death with a monument . The movement 's proponents were aroused by a strong sense of the incident 's importance : besides being the earliest major event in Wyandot County history , it was the county 's most prominent event of all time in their opinion . One of the county 's leading lawyers , Curtis Berry , originated the idea of marking the site . The marker is made of sandstone from Berea , Ohio , worked in the shape of a cannon and cut approximately 6.5 feet ( 2.0 m ) tall . Local labor at B.L .",
