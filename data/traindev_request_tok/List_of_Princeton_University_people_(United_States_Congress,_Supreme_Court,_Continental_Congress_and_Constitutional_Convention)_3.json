The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century .

The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State .

Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline .

Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

  "/wiki/Virginia": "Virginia ( /v\u0259r\u02c8d\u0292\u026ani\u0259/ ( listen ) ) , officially the Commonwealth of Virginia , is a state in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States located between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains . The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay , which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna . The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond ; Virginia Beach is the most populous city , and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision . The Commonwealth 's estimated population as of 2018 [ update ] is over 8.5 million . The area 's history begins with several indigenous groups , including the Powhatan . In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World . Virginia 's state nickname , the Old Dominion , is a reference to this status . Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony 's early politics and plantation economy . Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution . In the American Civil War , Virginia 's Secession Convention resolved to join the Confederacy , and Virginia 's First Wheeling Convention resolved to remain in the Union ; that led to the creation of West Virginia . Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction , both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia . The Virginia General Assembly is the oldest continuous law-making body in the New World .",

  "/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate": "The president pro tempore of the United States Senate ( often shortened to president pro tem ) is the second-highest-ranking official of the United States Senate . Article One , Section Three of the United States Constitution provides that the vice president of the United States is the president of the Senate ( despite not being a senator ) , and mandates that the Senate must choose a president pro tempore to act in the vice president 's absence . Unlike the vice president , the president pro tempore is an elected member of the Senate , able to speak or vote on any issue . Selected by the Senate at large , the president pro tempore has enjoyed many privileges and some limited powers . During the vice president 's absence , the president pro tempore is empowered to preside over Senate sessions . In practice , neither the vice president nor the president pro tempore usually presides ; instead , the duty of presiding officer is rotated among junior U.S. senators of the majority party to give them experience in parliamentary procedure . Since 1890 , the most senior U.S. senator in the majority party has generally been chosen to be president pro tempore and holds the office continuously until the election of another . This tradition has been observed without interruption since 1949 . Since the enactment of the current Presidential Succession Act in 1947 , the president pro tempore is third in the line of succession to the presidency , after the vice president and the speaker of the House of Representatives and ahead of the secretary of state . The current president pro tempore of the Senate is Iowa Republican Charles Grassley . Elected on January 3 , 2019 , he is the 91st person to serve in this office ."
