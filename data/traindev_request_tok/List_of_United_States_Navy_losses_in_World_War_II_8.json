The ship was built at the Charleston Naval Shipyard of North Charleston , South Carolina , from her keel laying in June 1918 , her launching in July 1918 , and her commissioning in July 1920 . Asheville began her career in the early 1920s on power-projection missions ( showing the flag ) in Central America . After her 1922 conversion to oil power from coal , Asheville sailed through the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean to join the Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines . She spent the rest of the 1920s protecting American interests and showing the flag in China . Between 1929 and 1931 , Asheville protected American lives and property in Nicaragua . She returned to the Asiatic Fleet and protected American interests as the Second Sino-Japanese War began . With increasing tensions with Japan , Asheville was withdrawn to the Philippines in the summer of 1941 , where she performed local patrol duty . After the American entry into World War II and the Japanese attacks on the Philippines , Asheville , and most of the surface ships in the Philippines , moved to Java to defend the Malay Barrier against the Japanese advance . When the Allied defense crumbled in early March , the remaining American ships were ordered to retreat to Australia . Sailing alone , Asheville was spotted , attacked , and sunk south of Java by a Japanese surface force of a heavy cruiser and two destroyers on 3 March 1942 .",
