  "/wiki/Wales": "Wales ( Welsh : Cymru [ \u02c8k\u0259mri ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779 km2 ( 8,023 sq mi ) . Wales has over 1,680 miles ( 2,700 km ) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ) , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .",
  "/wiki/Blenheim_Palace": "Blenheim Palace ( pronounced /\u02c8bl\u025bn\u026am/ BLEN-im ) is a monumental country house in Woodstock , Oxfordshire , England . It is the principal residence of the Dukes of Marlborough , and the only non-royal , non-episcopal country house in England to hold the title of palace . The palace , one of England 's largest houses , was built between 1705 and 1722 , and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 . The palace is named for the 1704 Battle of Blenheim , and thus ultimately after Blindheim ( also known as Blenheim ) in Bavaria . It was originally intended to be a reward to John Churchill , 1st Duke of Marlborough for his military triumphs against the French and Bavarians in the War of the Spanish Succession , culminating in the Battle of Blenheim . The land was given as a gift , and construction began in 1705 , with some financial support from Queen Anne . The project soon became the subject of political infighting , with the Crown cancelling further financial support in 1712 , Marlborough 's three-year voluntary exile to the Continent , the fall from influence of his duchy and lasting damage to the reputation of the architect Sir John Vanbrugh . Designed in the rare , and short-lived , English Baroque style , architectural appreciation of the palace is as divided today as it was in the 1720s . It is unique in its combined use as a family home , mausoleum and national monument . The palace is notable as the birthplace and ancestral home of Sir Winston Churchill . Following the palace 's completion , it became the home of the Churchill ( later Spencer-Churchill ) family for the next 300 years , and various members of the family have wrought changes to the interiors , park and gardens . At the end of the 19th century , the palace was saved from ruin by funds gained from the 9th Duke of Marlborough 's marriage to American railroad heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt .",

The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations .

[ a ] ) , was an English soldier and statesman whose career spanned the reigns of five monarchs . From a gentry family , he served first as a page at the court of the House of Stuart under James , Duke of York , through the 1670s and early 1680s , earning military and political advancement through his courage and diplomatic skill . Churchill 's role in defeating the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685 helped secure James on the throne , but he was a key player in the military conspiracy that led to James being deposed during the Glorious Revolution . Rewarded by William III with the title Earl of Marlborough , persistent charges of Jacobitism led to his fall from office and temporary imprisonment in the Tower of London . William recognised his abilities by appointing him as his deputy in Flanders before the War of the Spanish Succession in 1701 but it was not until the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 he secured his fame and fortune . Marriage to Sarah Jennings and her relationship with Anne ensured Marlborough 's rise , first to the Captain-Generalcy of British forces , then to a dukedom . As de facto leader of Allied forces in the Low Countries , his victories at Blenheim ( 1704 ) , Ramillies ( 1706 ) , Oudenarde ( 1708 ) , and Malplaquet ( 1709 ) , ensured his place in history as one of Europe 's great generals . His wife 's stormy relationship with the Queen , and her subsequent dismissal from court , was central to his own fall . Incurring Anne 's disfavour , and caught between Tory and Whig factions , Marlborough was forced from office and went into self-imposed exile . He returned to favour with the accession of George I to the British throne in 1714 , but a stroke in 1716 ended his active career . Marlborough 's leadership of the Allied armies fighting Louis XIV from 1701 to 1710 consolidated Britain 's emergence as a front-rank power , while his ability to maintain unity in the fractious coalition demonstrated his diplomatic skills .",

He wrote two argumentative and outspoken Restoration comedies , The Relapse ( 1696 ) and The Provoked Wife ( 1697 ) , which have become enduring stage favourites but originally occasioned much controversy . He was knighted in 1714 . Vanbrugh was in many senses a radical throughout his life . As a young man and a committed Whig , he was part of the scheme to overthrow James II and put William III on the throne . He was imprisoned by the French as a political prisoner . In his career as a playwright , he offended many sections of Restoration and 18th century society , not only by the sexual explicitness of his plays , but also by their messages in defence of women 's rights in marriage . He was attacked on both counts , and was one of the prime targets of Jeremy Collier 's Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage . In his architectural career , he created what came to be known as English Baroque . His architectural work was as bold and daring as his early political activism and marriage-themed plays , and jarred conservative opinions on the subject .",

  "/wiki/Romanesque_architecture": "Romanesque architecture is an architectural style of medieval Europe characterized by semi-circular arches . There is no consensus for the beginning date of the Romanesque style , with proposals ranging from the 6th to the 11th century , this later date being the most commonly held . In the 12th century it developed into the Gothic style , marked by pointed arches . Examples of Romanesque architecture can be found across the continent , making it the first pan-European architectural style since Imperial Roman architecture . The Romanesque style in England is traditionally referred to as Norman architecture . Combining features of ancient Roman and Byzantine buildings and other local traditions , Romanesque architecture is known by its massive quality , thick walls , round arches , sturdy pillars , barrel vaults , large towers and decorative arcading . Each building has clearly defined forms , frequently of very regular , symmetrical plan ; the overall appearance is one of simplicity when compared with the Gothic buildings that were to follow . The style can be identified right across Europe , despite regional characteristics and different materials . Many castles were built during this period , but they are greatly outnumbered by churches . The most significant are the great abbey churches , many of which are still standing , more or less complete and frequently in use . The enormous quantity of churches built in the Romanesque period was succeeded by the still busier period of Gothic architecture , which partly or entirely rebuilt most Romanesque churches in prosperous areas like England and Portugal . The largest groups of Romanesque survivors are in areas that were less prosperous in subsequent periods , including parts of southern France , rural Spain and rural Italy .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_architecture": "Gothic architecture ( Latin : francigenum opus ) is a style that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages . It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture . Originating in 12th-century France , it was widely used , especially for cathedrals and churches , until the 16th century . Its most prominent features included the use of the rib vault and the flying buttress , which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building , giving greater height and more space for windows . Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass and the rose window , to bring light and color to the interior . Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior , particularly over the portals , to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners . Some key architectural features , such as the pointed arch and a decorative kind of rib vault , existed earlier outside Europe , and may have been derived from Islamic architecture . These features had both existed in Romanesque architecture , but they were used more extensively and in more innovative ways to make Gothic cathedrals higher , stronger , and filled with light . The first important example is generally considered to be the Basilica of Saint-Denis , near Paris , whose choir was reconstructed with Gothic rib vaults and large stained glass windows between 1140 and 1144 .",

The fortifications were built by Edward I after his invasion of North Wales in 1282 . Edward defeated the local Welsh princes in a major campaign and set about permanently colonising the area . He created new fortified towns , protected by castles , in which English immigrants could settle and administer the territories . The project was hugely expensive and stretched royal resources to the limit . Fresh Welsh revolts followed in 1294 under the leadership of Madog ap Llywelyn . Conwy and Harlech were kept supplied by sea and held out against the attack , but Caernarfon , still only partially completed , was stormed . In the aftermath , Edward reinvigorated the building programme and ordered the commencement of work at Beaumaris .

He was the fifth king of the House of Plantagenet . Before his accession to the throne , he was commonly referred to as Lord Edward . The first son of Henry III , Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father 's reign , which included an outright rebellion by the English barons . In 1259 , he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement , supporting the Provisions of Oxford . After reconciliation with his father , however , he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict , known as the Second Barons ' War . After the Battle of Lewes , Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons , but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265 . Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and , with England pacified , Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land .

A substantial workforce was employed in the initial years under the direction of James of St George . Edward 's invasion of Scotland soon diverted funding from the project , however , and work stopped , only recommencing after an invasion scare in 1306 . When work finally ceased around 1330 a total of \u00a315,000 had been spent , a huge sum for the period , but the castle remained incomplete . Beaumaris Castle was taken by Welsh forces in 1403 during the rebellion of Owain Glynd\u0175r , but recaptured by royal forces in 1405 . Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 , the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I , holding out until 1646 when it surrendered to the Parliamentary armies . Despite forming part of a local royalist rebellion in 1648 , the castle escaped slighting and was garrisoned by Parliament , but fell into ruin around 1660 , eventually forming part of a stately home and park in the 19th century . In the 21st century , the ruined castle is still a tourist attraction . Historian Arnold Taylor described Beaumaris Castle as Britain 's most perfect example of symmetrical concentric planning . The fortification is built of local stone , with a moated outer ward guarded by twelve towers and two gatehouses , overlooked by an inner ward with two large , D-shaped gatehouses and six massive towers .

It withstood the siege of Madog ap Llywelyn in the winter of 1294-95 , acted as a temporary haven for Richard II in 1399 and was held for several months by forces loyal to Owain Glynd\u0175r in 1401 . Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 , the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I , holding out until 1646 when it surrendered to the Parliamentary armies . In the aftermath , the castle was partially slighted by Parliament to prevent it being used in any further revolt , and was finally completely ruined in 1665 when its remaining iron and lead was stripped and sold off . Conwy Castle became an attractive destination for painters in the late 18th and early 19th centuries . Visitor numbers grew and initial restoration work was carried out in the second half of the 19th century . In the 21st century , the ruined castle is managed by Cadw as a tourist attraction . UNESCO considers Conwy to be one of the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe , and it is classed as a World Heritage site . The rectangular castle is built from local and imported stone and occupies a coastal ridge , originally overlooking an important crossing point over the River Conwy .",
  "/wiki/Harlech_Castle": "Harlech Castle ( Welsh : Castell Harlech ) , located in Harlech , Gwynedd , Wales , is a Grade I-listed medieval fortification , constructed atop a spur of rock close to the Irish Sea . It was built by Edward I during his invasion of Wales between 1282 and 1289 at the relatively modest cost of \u00a38,190 . Over the next few centuries , the castle played an important part in several wars , withstanding the siege of Madog ap Llywelyn between 1294-95 , but falling to Owain Glynd\u0175r in 1404 . It then became Glynd\u0175r 's residence and military headquarters for the remainder of the uprising until being recaptured by English forces in 1409 . During the 15th century Wars of the Roses , Harlech was held by the Lancastrians for seven years , before Yorkist troops forced its surrender in 1468 , a siege memorialised in the song Men of Harlech . Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 , the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I , holding out until 1647 when it became the last fortification to surrender to the Parliamentary armies . In the 21st century the ruined castle is managed by Cadw , the Welsh Government 's historic environment service , as a tourist attraction . UNESCO considers Harlech to be one of the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe , and it is classed as a World Heritage site . The fortification is built of local stone and concentric in design , featuring a massive gatehouse that probably once provided high-status accommodation for the castle constable and visiting dignitaries . The sea originally came much closer to Harlech than in modern times , and a water-gate and a long flight of steps leads down from the castle to the former shore , which allowed the castle to be resupplied by sea during sieges . In keeping with Edward 's other castles in North Wales , the architecture of Harlech has close to links to that found in the County of Savoy during the same period , an influence probably derived from the Savoy origins of the main architect , James of Saint George .",

Bath is in the valley of the River Avon , 97 miles ( 156 km ) west of London and 11 miles ( 18 km ) southeast of Bristol . The city became a World Heritage site in 1987 . The city became a spa with the Latin name Aquae Sulis ( the waters of Sul ) c. 60 AD when the Romans built baths and a temple in the valley of the River Avon , although hot springs were known even before then . Bath Abbey was founded in the 7th century and became a religious centre ; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries . In the 17th century , claims were made for the curative properties of water from the springs , and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era . Georgian architecture , crafted from Bath stone , includes the Royal Crescent , Circus , Pump Room and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city 's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761 . Many of the streets and squares were laid out by John Wood , the Elder , and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew . Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century . Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II .

  "/wiki/Palladian_architecture": "Palladian architecture is a European style of architecture derived from and inspired by the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio ( 1508-1580 ) . What is recognised as Palladian architecture today is an evolution of his original concepts . Palladio 's work was strongly based on the symmetry , perspective , and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans . From the 17th century Palladio 's interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as Palladianism . It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century . In Britain , Palladianism was briefly in vogue during the 17th century , but its flowering was cut short by the onset of the English Civil War and the imposition of austerity which followed . In the early 18th century it returned to fashion , not only in England but also , directly influenced from Britain , in Prussia . Count Francesco Algarotti may have written to Lord Burlington from Berlin that he was recommending to Frederick the Great the adoption in Prussia of the architectural style Burlington had introduced in England , but Knobelsdorff 's opera house on the Unter den Linden boulevard , based on Campbell 's Wanstead House , had been constructed from 1741 . Later in the century , when the style was falling from favour in Europe , it had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America , highlighted by examples such as Drayton Hall in South Carolina , the Redwood Library in Newport , Rhode Island , the Morris-Jumel Mansion in New York City , the Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis , Maryland and Thomas Jefferson 's Monticello and Poplar Forest in Virginia . The style continued to be utilized in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries , where it was frequently employed in the design of public and municipal buildings . From the latter half of the 19th century it was rivalled by the Gothic revival in the English-speaking world , whose champions such as Augustus Pugin , remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples , deemed it too pagan for Anglican and Anglo-Catholic worship . However , as an architectural style it has continued to be popular and to evolve ; its pediments , symmetry and proportions are clearly evident in the design of many modern buildings today .",

  "/wiki/Derwent_Valley_Mills": "Derwent Valley Mills is a World Heritage Site along the River Derwent in Derbyshire , England , designated in December 2001 . It is administered by the Derwent Valley Mills Partnership . The modern factory , or 'mill ' , system was born here in the 18th century to accommodate the new technology for spinning cotton developed by Richard Arkwright . With advancements in technology , it became possible to produce cotton continuously . The system was adopted throughout the valley , and later spread so that by 1788 there were over 200 Arkwright-type mills in Britain . Arkwright 's inventions and system of organising labour was exported to Europe and the United States . Water-power was first introduced to England by John Lombe at his silk mill in Derby in 1719 , but it was Richard Arkwright who applied water-power to the process of producing cotton in the 1770s . His patent of a water frame allowed cotton to be spun continuously , meaning it could be produced by unskilled workers . Cromford Mill was the site of Arkwright 's first mill , with nearby Cromford village significantly expanded for his then-new workforce ; this system of production and workers ' housing was copied throughout the valley . To ensure the presence of a labour force , it was necessary to construct housing for the mill workers . Thus , new settlements were established by mill owners around the mills - sometimes developing a pre-existing community - with their own amenities such as schools , chapels , and markets . Most of the housing still exists and is still in use .",

  "/wiki/Factory_system": "The factory system is a method of manufacturing using machinery and division of labour . Because of the high capital cost of machinery and factory buildings , factories were typically privately owned by wealthy individuals who employed the operative labour . Use of machinery with the division of labour reduced the required skill level of workers and also increased the output per worker . The factory system was first adopted in Britain at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century and later spread around the world . It replaced the putting-out system ( Domestic System ) . The main characteristic of the factory system is the use of machinery , originally powered by water or steam and later by electricity . Other characteristics of the system mostly derive from the use of machinery or economies of scale , the centralization of factories , and standardization of interchangeable parts .",

  "/wiki/Water_frame": "The water frame is a spinning frame that is powered by a water-wheel . Water frames in general have existed since ancient Egypt times . Richard Arkwright , who patented the technology in 1769 , designed a model for the production of cotton thread ; this was first used in 1765 . The Arkwright water frame was able to spin 96 threads at a time , which was an easier and faster method than ever before . The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas Highs by clock maker John Kay , who was hired by Arkwright . Being run on water power , it produced stronger and harder yarn than the then-famous spinning jenny , and propelled the adoption of the modern factory system . Another water-powered frame for the production of textiles was developed in 1760 , in the early industrialised town of Elberfeld , Prussia ( now in Wuppertal , Germany ) , by German bleach plant owner Johann Heinrich Bockm\u00fchl . The water frame is derived from the use of a water wheel to drive a number of spinning frames . The water wheel provided more power to the spinning frame than human operators , reducing the amount of human labor needed and increasing the spindle count dramatically . However , unlike the spinning jenny , the water frame could spin only one thread at a time until Samuel Compton combined the two inventions into his spinning mule in 1779 . The water frame was originally powered by horses at a factory built by Arkwright and partners in Nottingham . In 1770 Arkwright and partners built a water powered mill in Cromford , Derbyshire .",
  "/wiki/Industrial_Revolution": "The Industrial Revolution , now also known as the First Industrial Revolution , was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States , in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840 . This transition included going from hand production methods to machines , new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes , the increasing use of steam power and water power , the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system . The Industrial Revolution also led to an unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth . Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment , value of output and capital invested . The textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods . :40 The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain , and many of the technological innovations were of British origin . By the mid-18th century Britain was the world 's leading commercial nation , controlling a global trading empire with colonies in North America and the Caribbean , and with major military and political hegemony on the Indian subcontinent , particularly with the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal , through the activities of the East India Company . The development of trade and the rise of business were among the major causes of the Industrial Revolution . :15 The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history ; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way . In particular , average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth . Some economists say that the major effect of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population in the western world began to increase consistently for the first time in history , although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries . GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy , while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies .",

The site spans 185 million years of geological history , coastal erosion having exposed an almost continuous sequence of rock formation covering the Triassic , Jurassic and Cretaceous periods . At different times , this area has been desert , shallow tropical sea and marsh , and the fossilised remains of the various creatures that lived here have been preserved in the rocks . Natural features seen on this stretch of coast include arches , pinnacles and stack rocks . In some places the sea has broken through resistant rocks to produce coves with restricted entrances and , in one place , the Isle of Portland is connected to the land by a narrow spit . In some parts of the coast , landslides are common . These have exposed a wide range of fossils , the different rock types each having its own typical fauna and flora , thus providing evidence of how animals and plants evolved in this region . The area around Lulworth Cove contains a fossil forest , and 71 different rock strata have been identified at Lyme Regis , each with its own species of ammonite . The fossil collector Mary Anning lived here and her major discoveries of marine reptiles and other fossils were made at a time when the study of palaeontology was just starting to develop .

The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the Early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : in the English Civil War , an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the Second World War , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points .

He had decided to become a monk after seeing a vision on the night in 651 that St Aidan , the founder of Lindisfarne , died , but he seems to have seen some military service first . He was quickly made guest-master at the new monastery at Ripon , soon after 655 , but had to return with Eata of Hexham to Melrose when Wilfrid was given the monastery instead . About 662 he was made prior at Melrose , and around 665 went as prior to Lindisfarne . In 684 he was made bishop of Lindisfarne , but by late 686 he resigned and returned to his hermitage as he felt he was about to die , although he was probably only in his early 50s .",

Born on lands belonging to the twin monastery of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow in present-day Tyne and Wear , Bede was sent to Monkwearmouth at the age of seven and later joined Abbot Ceolfrith at Jarrow , both of whom survived a plague that struck in 686 , an outbreak that killed a majority of the population there . While he spent most of his life in the monastery , Bede travelled to several abbeys and monasteries across the British Isles , even visiting the archbishop of York and King Ceolwulf of Northumbria . He is well known as an author , teacher ( a student of one of his pupils was Alcuin ) , and scholar , and his most famous work , Ecclesiastical History of the English People , gained him the title The Father of English History . His ecumenical writings were extensive and included a number of Biblical commentaries and other theological works of exegetical erudition . Another important area of study for Bede was the academic discipline of computus , otherwise known to his contemporaries as the science of calculating calendar dates . One of the more important dates Bede tried to compute was Easter , an effort that was mired with controversy . He also helped establish the practice of dating forward from the birth of Christ ( Anno Domini - in the year of our Lord ) , a practice which eventually became commonplace in medieval Europe . Bede was one of the greatest teachers and writers of the Early Middle Ages and is considered by many historians to be the single most important scholar of antiquity for the period between the death of Pope Gregory I in 604 and the coronation of Charlemagne in 800 . In 1899 , Pope Leo XIII declared him a Doctor of the Church . He is the only native of Great Britain to achieve this designation ; Anselm of Canterbury , also a Doctor of the Church , was originally from Italy . Bede was moreover a skilled linguist and translator , and his work made the Latin and Greek writings of the early Church Fathers much more accessible to his fellow Anglo-Saxons , which contributed significantly to English Christianity .",

Cumbria is one of the most sparsely populated counties in England , with 73.4 people per km2 ( 190/sq mi ) . Cumbria is the third largest county in England by area , and is bounded to the north by the Scottish council areas of Dumfries and Galloway and Scottish Borders , to the west by the Irish Sea , to the south by Lancashire , to the southeast by North Yorkshire , and to the east by County Durham and Northumberland . Cumbria is predominantly rural and contains the Lake District National Park , a UNESCO World Heritage Site considered one of England 's finest areas of natural beauty , serving as inspiration for artists , writers , and musicians . A large area of the southeast of the county is within the Yorkshire Dales National Park while the east of the county fringes the North Pennines AONB . Much of Cumbria is mountainous , and it contains every peak in England over 3,000 feet ( 910 m ) above sea level , with Scafell Pike at 3,209 feet ( 978 m ) being the highest point of England . An upland , coastal , and rural area , Cumbria 's history is characterised by invasions , migration , and settlement , as well as battles and skirmishes between the English and the Scots . Notable historic sites in Cumbria include Carlisle Castle , Furness Abbey , Hardknott Roman Fort , Brough Castle and Hadrian 's Wall ( also a World Heritage Site ) .",
  "/wiki/Picturesque": "Picturesque is an aesthetic ideal introduced into English cultural debate in 1782 by William Gilpin in Observations on the River Wye , and Several Parts of South Wales , etc . Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty ; made in the Summer of the Year 1770 , a practical book which instructed Englands leisured travellers to examine the face of a country by the rules of picturesque beauty . Picturesque , along with the aesthetic and cultural strands of Gothic and Celticism , was a part of the emerging Romantic sensibility of the 18th century . The term picturesque needs to be understood in relationship to two other aesthetic ideals : the beautiful and the sublime . By the last third of the 18th century , Enlightenment and rationalist ideas about aesthetics were being challenged by looking at the experiences of beauty and sublimity as non-rational . Aesthetic experience was not just a rational decision - one did not look at a pleasing curved form and decide it was beautiful ; rather it came naturally as a matter of basic human instinct . Edmund Burke in his 1757 A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful argued that the soft gentle curves appealed to the male sexual desire , while the sublime horrors appealed to our desires for self-preservation . Picturesque arose as a mediator between these opposed ideals of beauty and the sublime , showing the possibilities that existed between these two rationally idealized states . As Thomas Gray wrote in 1765 of the Scottish Highlands : The mountains are ecstatic [ \u2026 ] . None but those monstrous creatures of God know how to join so much beauty with so much horror . See also Gilpin and the picturesque .",
  "/wiki/Romanticism": "Romanticism ( also known as the Romantic era ) was an artistic , literary , musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century , and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850 . Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature , preferring the medieval rather than the classical . It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution , the aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment , and the scientific rationalization of nature - all components of modernity . It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts , music , and literature , but had a major impact on historiography , education , the social sciences , and the natural sciences . [ failed verification ] It had a significant and complex effect on politics , with romantic thinkers influencing liberalism , radicalism , conservatism and nationalism . The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience , placing new emphasis on such emotions as apprehension , horror and terror , and awe - especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublimity and beauty of nature . It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble , but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic ( as in the musical impromptu ) . In contrast to the Rationalism and Classicism of the Enlightenment , Romanticism revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth , early urban sprawl , and industrialism . Although the movement was rooted in the German Sturm und Drang movement , which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment , the events and ideologies of the French Revolution were also proximate factors . Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of heroic individualists and artists , whose examples , it maintained , would raise the quality of society . It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art . There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability , a Zeitgeist , in the representation of its ideas .",

  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",
  "/wiki/Cantilever_bridge": "A cantilever bridge is a bridge built using cantilevers , structures that project horizontally into space , supported on only one end . For small footbridges , the cantilevers may be simple beams ; however , large cantilever bridges designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel , or box girders built from prestressed concrete . The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice , as it can span distances of over 1,500 feet ( 460 m ) , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework .",

Originally the Latin noun l\u012bmes ( English : /\u02c8la\u026ami\u02d0z/ ; Latin pl . l\u012bmit\u0113s ) had a number of different meanings : a path or balk delimiting fields , a boundary line or marker , any road or path , any channel , such as a stream channel , or any distinction or difference . The term was also commonly used after the 3rd century AD to denote a military district under the command of a dux limitis . Limes has sometimes been used in modern times primarily for the Germanic border defence or delimiting system of Ancient Rome marking the Borders of the Roman Empire , but it was not used by the Romans for this purpose .

  "/wiki/Hadrian's_Wall": "Hadrian 's Wall ( Latin : Vallum Aelium ) , also called the Roman Wall , Picts ' Wall , or Vallum Hadriani in Latin , was a defensive fortification in the Roman province of Britannia , begun in AD 122 in the reign of the emperor Hadrian . It ran from the banks of the River Tyne near the North Sea to the Solway Firth on the Irish Sea , and was the northern limit of the Roman Empire , immediately north of which were the lands of the northern Ancient Britons , including the Picts . It had a stone base and a stone wall . There were milecastles with two turrets in between . There was a fort about every five Roman miles . From north to south , the wall comprised a ditch , wall , military way and vallum , another ditch with adjoining mounds . It is thought the milecastles were staffed with static garrisons , whereas the forts had fighting garrisons of infantry and cavalry . In addition to the wall 's defensive military role , its gates may have been customs posts . A significant portion of the wall still stands and can be followed on foot along the adjoining Hadrian 's Wall Path . The largest Roman archaeological feature in Britain , it runs a total of 73 miles ( 117.5 kilometres ) in northern England . Regarded as a British cultural icon , Hadrian 's Wall is one of Britain 's major ancient tourist attractions . It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 .",
  "/wiki/Antonine_Wall": "The Antonine Wall , known to the Romans as Vallum Antonini , was a turf fortification on stone foundations , built by the Romans across what is now the Central Belt of Scotland , between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde . Representing the northernmost frontier barrier of the Roman Empire , it spanned approximately 63 kilometres ( 39 miles ) and was about 3 metres ( 10 feet ) high and 5 metres ( 16 feet ) wide . Lidar scans have been carried out to establish the length of the wall and the Roman distance units used . Security was bolstered by a deep ditch on the northern side . It is thought that there was a wooden palisade on top of the turf . The barrier was the second of two great walls created by the Romans in Great Britain . Its ruins are less evident than those of the better-known Hadrian 's Wall to the south , primarily because the turf and wood wall has largely weathered away , unlike its stone-built southern predecessor . Construction began in AD 142 at the order of Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius , and took about 12 years to complete . Antoninus Pius never visited Britain , whereas his predecessor Hadrian had done so . Pressure from the Caledonians may have led Antoninus to send the empire 's troops further north . The Antonine Wall was protected by 16 forts with small fortlets between them ; troop movement was facilitated by a road linking all the sites known as the Military Way . The soldiers who built the wall commemorated the construction and their struggles with the Caledonians with decorative slabs , twenty of which survive .",

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe , North Africa and West Asia ruled by emperors . From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century , it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and its city of Rome as sole capital ( 27 BC - 286 AD ) . Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis , the empire was forcibly reassembled , then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire ( based in Milan and later in Ravenna ) and over the Eastern Roman Empire ( based in Nicomedia and later in Constantinople ) . Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD , when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ( Byzantium - Ancient Greek : \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , Byz\u00e1ntion ) following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus . The fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings , along with the hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire into the Byzantine Empire , conventionally marks the end of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages . The predecessor state of the Roman Empire , the Roman Republic ( which had replaced Rome 's monarchy in the 6th century BC ) became severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflicts . In the mid-1st century BC Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and proscriptions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . The following year Octavian conquered Ptolemaic Egypt , ending the Hellenistic period that had begun with the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC . Octavian 's power then became unassailable , and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively making him the first Roman emperor . The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana ( Roman Peace ) .",

Many other Neanderthal communities went extinct around the same time . The skull of a Neanderthal woman , discovered in a quarry in 1848 , was only the second Neanderthal skull ever found and the first adult Neanderthal skull to be discovered , eight years before the discovery of the skull for which the species was named in Neandertal , Germany ; had it been recognised as a separate species , it might have been called Calpican ( or Gibraltarian ) rather than Neanderthal Man . The skull of a Neanderthal child was discovered nearby in 1926 . The Neanderthals are known to have occupied ten sites on the Gibraltar peninsula at the southern tip of Iberia , which may have had one of the densest areas of Neanderthal settlement of anywhere in Europe , although not necessarily the last place of possible habitation . The caves in the Rock of Gibraltar that the Neanderthals inhabited have been excavated and have revealed a wealth of information about their lifestyle and the prehistoric landscape of the area . The peninsula stood on the edge of a fertile coastal plain , now submerged , that supported a wide variety of animals and plants which the Neanderthals exploited to provide a highly varied diet . Unlike northern Europe , which underwent massive swings in its climate and was largely uninhabitable for long periods , the far south of Iberia enjoyed a stable and mild climate for over 125,000 years . It became a refuge from the ice ages for animals , plants and Neanderthals , the latter of which most certainly did not survive there for thousand years longer than any other habitation site . Around 42,000 years ago , the climate underwent cycles of abrupt change which would have greatly disrupt the Gibraltar Neanderthals ' food supply and may have stressed their population beyond recovery , leading to their aggregated extinction in areas of Europe with similar climates .

Neanderthals are known from numerous fossils , especially from after 130 kya . The type specimen , Neanderthal 1 , was found in 1856 in the German Neander Valley . After much debate over their validity , Neanderthals were depicted as being primitive , stupid , and brutish for much of the early 20th century . Though knowledge and perception of them has markedly changed since then in the scientific community , the image of the unevolved caveman archetype remains prevalent in popular culture . Compared to modern humans , Neanderthals were stockier , with somewhat shorter limbs and a larger chest and nose . These features are often explained as adaptations to conserve heat in a cold climate , but ( aside from body fat storage ) they are more likely products of genetic drift and adaptations for sprinting in the warmer , forested landscape that Neanderthals often inhabited . The braincases of Neanderthal men and women averaged about 1,600 cm3 ( 98 cu in ) and 1,300 cm3 ( 79 cu in ) respectively , which is within the range of the values for modern humans .",
  "/wiki/Anatomically_modern_human": "Homo sapiens is the only extant human species . The name is Latin for 'wise man ' and was introduced in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus ( who is himself the lectotype for the species ) . Extinct species of the genus Homo include Homo erectus , extant from roughly 1.9 to 0.4 million years ago , and a number of other species ( by some authors considered subspecies of either H. sapiens or H. erectus ) . The divergence of the lineage leading to H. sapiens out of ancestral H. erectus ( or an intermediate species such as Homo antecessor ) is estimated to have occurred in Africa roughly 500,000 years ago . The earliest fossil evidence of early Homo sapiens appears in Africa around 300,000 years ago , with the earliest genetic splits among modern people , according to some evidence , dating to around the same time . [ note 1 ] Sustained archaic admixture is known to have taken place both in Africa and ( following the recent Out-Of-Africa expansion ) in Eurasia , between about 100,000 and 30,000 years ago . The term anatomically modern humans ( AMH ) is used to distinguish H. sapiens having an anatomy consistent with the range of phenotypes seen in contemporary humans from varieties of extinct archaic humans . This is useful especially for times and regions where anatomically modern and archaic humans co-existed , for example , in Paleolithic Europe . Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka ) .",

The local council is Orkney Islands Council , one of only three Councils in Scotland with a majority of elected members who are independents . [ Notes 2 ] The islands have been inhabited for at least 8,500 years , originally occupied by Mesolithic and Neolithic tribes and then by the Picts . Orkney was colonised and later annexed by Norway in 875 and settled by the Norse . The Scottish Parliament then absorbed the earldom to the Scottish Crown in 1472 , following the failed payment of a dowry for James III 's bride Margaret of Denmark .
