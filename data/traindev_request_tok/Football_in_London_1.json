Nicknamed the Dons and latterly also the Wombles , they won eight Isthmian League titles , the FA Amateur Cup in 1963 and three successive Southern League championships between 1975 and 1977 , and were then elected to the Football League . The team rose quickly from obscurity during the 1980s and were promoted to the then top-flight First Division in 1986 , just four seasons after being in the Fourth Division . Wimbledon 's Crazy Gang - so-called because of the boisterous , eccentric behaviour of the players - won the FA Cup in 1988 , beating that season 's League champions Liverpool , and thereby became one of only three clubs to have won both the FA Cup and its amateur counterpart . [ n 2 ] In 1991 , following the publication of the Taylor Report recommending all-seater grounds for top-flight clubs , Wimbledon left Plough Lane to groundshare with nearby Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park - an originally temporary arrangement that ended up lasting over a decade . The team remained in the First Division and its successor the FA Premier League until they were relegated in 2000 . In 2001 , after rejecting a variety of possible local sites and others further afield , the club announced its intention to move 56 miles ( 90 km ) north to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire . The idea of Wimbledon leaving south London was deeply unpopular , both with the bulk of the club 's established fanbase and with football supporters generally , but an independent commission appointed by the Football Association granted permission in May 2002 . A group of supporters , appalled by the decision , responded by forming a new club , AFC Wimbledon , to which the large majority of Wimbledon fans immediately switched allegiance .

  "/wiki/1988_FA_Cup_Final": "The 1988 FA Cup Final was the 107th final of the FA Cup . It took place on 14 May 1988 at Wembley Stadium and was contested between Wimbledon and Liverpool , the dominant English club side of the 1980s and newly crowned league champions . In one of the biggest shocks in the history of the competition , Lawrie Sanchez ' solitary goal of the game won Wimbledon their only FA Cup final win in their history ; they had just completed their second season in the Football League First Division and had only been in the Football League for 11 years . The final also featured the first penalty save in an FA Cup final , by Dave Beasant from John Aldridge . Beasant is often mistakenly believed to have been the first goalkeeper to captain a winning side in an FA Cup Final but this honour falls to Major William Merriman of the Royal Engineers who captained his side to victory in 1875 . It was the last FA Cup final to be broadcast by both the BBC and ITV , which had happened since 1958 . Wimbledon 's victory ended Liverpool 's bid to become the first team to win the Double twice , a feat that was eventually achieved by rivals Manchester United in 1996 and Arsenal in 1998 .",
