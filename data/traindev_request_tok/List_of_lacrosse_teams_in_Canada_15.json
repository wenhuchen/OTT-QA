  "/wiki/Minto_Cup": "The Minto Cup is awarded annually to the champion junior men 's box lacrosse team of Canada . It was donated in 1901 by the Governor-General , Lord Minto . Originally restricted to amateurs , within three years the first under-the-table professional teams were already competing for it . After 1904 , with efforts to keep the professionals out of competition proving to be futile , it was made open to all challengers . The last successful amateur challenge came in 1908 when New Westminster Salmonbellies won it ; the last amateur challenge was made in 1913 by Vancouver Athletic Club . This would be the only time in Canadian lacrosse history when the Mann Cup champions ( Vancouver ) faced the Minto Cup champions ( New Westminster ) head-to-head - with the silverware ( Minto ) going to the winner . With the professionals essentially in control of the cup by 1910 , the newly inaugurated Mann Cup became the replacement for the senior men 's national amateur championship . The Minto Cup professional competition was dominated by the New Westminster Salmonbellies , who held the trophy for 21 of the 29 years in which it was contested ( the competition was suspended during World War I ) . 1924 was the last year professionals played for the Minto Cup - after the Coast professional league folded in June 1924 , it was then placed into storage and for a time lost and forgotten when the last trustee died . The trophy was located just prior to the 1938 junior competition , underneath a desk in his office . During the trophy 's period of inactivity , there were suggestions to make the Minto Cup an international championship trophy . In 1934 the last trustee appointed to supervise the Cup died , and the Lord Minto of the day eventually transferred it to the Canadian Lacrosse Association , which decided to award it as the trophy for the national junior men 's champion , starting in 1937 .",

The community was founded in the mid-18th century by Mohawk families from Kahnawake ( also known as Caughnawaga ) , a Catholic Mohawk village that developed south of Montreal along the St. Lawrence River . Today Akwesasne has a total of 12,000 residents , with the largest population and land area of any Kanien'keh\u00e1 : ka community . From its development in the mid-eighteenth century , Akwesasne was considered one of the Seven Nations of Canada .

The portion in New York state is known as the federally recognized St. Regis Mohawk Reservation . The portion in Ontario is referred to as Akwesasne Reserve No .",
