At an early age , Montessori broke gender barriers and expectations when she enrolled in classes at an all-boys technical school , with hopes of becoming an engineer . She soon had a change of heart and began medical school at the Sapienza University of Rome , where she graduated - with honors - in 1896 . Her educational method is still in use today in many public and private schools throughout the world .",
  "/wiki/Natural_sciences": "Natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description , prediction , and understanding of natural phenomena , based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation . Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances . Natural science can be divided into two main branches : life science ( or biological science ) and physical science . Physical science is subdivided into branches , including physics , chemistry , astronomy and Earth science . These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches ( also known as fields ) . As empirical sciences , natural sciences use tools from the formal sciences , such as mathematics and logic , converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements of the laws of nature . Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to natural philosophy , usually traced to ancient Greece . Galileo , Descartes , Bacon , and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way . Still , philosophical perspectives , conjectures , and presuppositions , often overlooked , remain necessary in natural science . Systematic data collection , including discovery science , succeeded natural history , which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants , animals , minerals , and so on . Today , natural history suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences .",
  "/wiki/Montessori_method": "The Montessori Method of Education , developed by Maria Montessori , is a child-centered educational approach based on scientific observations of children . Montessori 's method has been used for over 100 years in many parts of the world . The Montessori method views the child as the one who is naturally eager for knowledge and capable of initiating learning in a supportive , thoughtfully prepared learning environment . It attempts to develop children physically , socially , emotionally and cognitively . Although a range of practices exist under the name Montessori , the Association Montessori Internationale ( AMI ) and the American Montessori Society ( AMS ) cite these elements as essential :",

Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines , and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves . [ a ] Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and , through its inclusion of astronomy , perhaps the oldest . Over much of the past two millennia , physics , chemistry , biology , and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy , but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right . [ b ] Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research , such as biophysics and quantum chemistry , and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined . New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy . Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies . For example , advances in the understanding of electromagnetism , solid-state physics , and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society , such as television , computers , domestic appliances , and nuclear weapons ; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization ; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus .",
  "/wiki/Barometer": "A barometer is a scientific instrument that is used to measure air pressure in a certain environment . Pressure tendency can forecast short term changes in the weather . Many measurements of air pressure are used within surface weather analysis to help find surface troughs , pressure systems and frontal boundaries . Barometers and pressure altimeters ( the most basic and common type of altimeter ) are essentially the same instrument , but used for different purposes . An altimeter is intended to be used at different levels matching the corresponding atmospheric pressure to the altitude , while a barometer is kept at the same level and measures subtle pressure changes caused by weather and elements of weather . The average atmospheric pressure on the earth 's surface varies between 940mb to 1040 mb . The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1013 mb .",
  "/wiki/Optics": "Optics is the branch of physics that studies the behaviour and properties of light , including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments that use or detect it . Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible , ultraviolet , and infrared light . Because light is an electromagnetic wave , other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays , microwaves , and radio waves exhibit similar properties . Most optical phenomena can be accounted for using the classical electromagnetic description of light . Complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are , however , often difficult to apply in practice . Practical optics is usually done using simplified models . The most common of these , geometric optics , treats light as a collection of rays that travel in straight lines and bend when they pass through or reflect from surfaces . Physical optics is a more comprehensive model of light , which includes wave effects such as diffraction and interference that can not be accounted for in geometric optics . Historically , the ray-based model of light was developed first , followed by the wave model of light . Progress in electromagnetic theory in the 19th century led to the discovery that light waves were in fact electromagnetic radiation . Some phenomena depend on the fact that light has both wave-like and particle-like properties . Explanation of these effects requires quantum mechanics .",
  "/wiki/Enrico_Fermi": "Enrico Fermi ( Italian : [ en\u02c8ri\u02d0ko \u02c8fermi ] ; 29 September 1901 - 28 November 1954 ) was an Italian-American physicist and the creator of the world 's first nuclear reactor , the Chicago Pile-1 . He has been called the architect of the nuclear age and the architect of the atomic bomb . He was one of very few physicists to excel in both theoretical physics and experimental physics . Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power , and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and for the discovery of transuranium elements . He made significant contributions to the development of statistical mechanics , quantum theory , and nuclear and particle physics . Fermi 's first major contribution involved the field of statistical mechanics . After Wolfgang Pauli formulated his exclusion principle in 1925 , Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an ideal gas , employing a statistical formulation now known as Fermi-Dirac statistics . Today , particles that obey the exclusion principle are called fermions . Pauli later postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an electron during beta decay , to satisfy the law of conservation of energy . Fermi took up this idea , developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle , which he named the neutrino . His theory , later referred to as Fermi 's interaction and now called weak interaction , described one of the four fundamental interactions in nature . Through experiments inducing radioactivity with the recently discovered neutron , Fermi discovered that slow neutrons were more easily captured by atomic nuclei than fast ones , and he developed the Fermi age equation to describe this .",

  "/wiki/Atomic_bomb": "A nuclear weapon ( also called an atom bomb , nuke , atomic bomb , nuclear warhead , A-bomb , or nuclear bomb ) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions , either fission ( fission bomb ) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions ( thermonuclear bomb ) . Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter . The first test of a fission ( atomic ) bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT ( 84 TJ ) . The first thermonuclear ( hydrogen ) bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT ( 42 PJ ) . A thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) can release energy equal to more than 1.2 million tons of TNT ( 5.0 PJ ) . A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast , fire , and radiation . Since they are weapons of mass destruction , the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy . Nuclear weapons have been used twice in war , both times by the United States against Japan near the end of World War II . On August 6 , 1945 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed Little Boy over the Japanese city of Hiroshima ; three days later , on August 9 , the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed Fat Man over the Japanese city of Nagasaki . These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel . The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan 's surrender are subjects of debate . Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , nuclear weapons have been detonated over two thousand times for testing and demonstration .",
  "/wiki/Neutron_irradiation": "Neutron activation is the process in which neutron radiation induces radioactivity in materials , and occurs when atomic nuclei capture free neutrons , becoming heavier and entering excited states . The excited nucleus often decays immediately by emitting gamma rays , or particles such as beta particles , alpha particles , fission products , and neutrons ( in nuclear fission ) . Thus , the process of neutron capture , even after any intermediate decay , often results in the formation of an unstable activation product . Such radioactive nuclei can exhibit half-lives ranging from small fractions of a second to many years . Neutron activation is the only common way that a stable material can be induced into becoming intrinsically radioactive . All naturally occurring materials , including air , water , and soil , can be induced ( activated ) by neutron capture into some amount of radioactivity in varying degrees , as a result of production of neutron-rich radioisotopes . Some atoms require more than one neutron to become unstable , which makes them harder to activate because the probability of a double or triple capture by a nucleus is below that of single capture . Water , for example , is made up of hydrogen and oxygen . Hydrogen requires a double capture to attain instability as tritium ( hydrogen-3 ) , while natural oxygen ( oxygen-16 ) requires three captures to become unstable oxygen-19 . Thus water is relatively difficult to activate , as compared to sodium chloride ( NaCl ) , in which both the sodium and chlorine ions become unstable with a single capture each . These facts were realized first-hand at the Operation Crossroads atomic test series in 1946 .",
  "/wiki/Nuclear_chain_reaction": "A nuclear chain reaction occurs when one single nuclear reaction causes an average of one or more subsequent nuclear reactions , thus leading to the possibility of a self-propagating series of these reactions . The specific nuclear reaction may be the fission of heavy isotopes ( e.g. , uranium-235 , 235U ) . The nuclear chain reaction releases several million times more energy per reaction than any chemical reaction .",
  "/wiki/Fermi\u2013Dirac_statistics": "In quantum statistics , a branch of physics , Fermi-Dirac statistics describe a distribution of particles over energy states in systems consisting of many identical particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle . It is named after Enrico Fermi and Paul Dirac , each of whom discovered the method independently ( although Fermi defined the statistics earlier than Dirac ) . Fermi-Dirac ( F-D ) statistics apply to identical particles with half-integer spin in a system with thermodynamic equilibrium . Additionally , the particles in this system are assumed to have negligible mutual interaction . That allows the multi-particle system to be described in terms of single-particle energy states . The result is the F-D distribution of particles over these states which includes the condition that no two particles can occupy the same state ; this has a considerable effect on the properties of the system . Since F-D statistics apply to particles with half-integer spin , these particles have come to be called fermions . It is most commonly applied to electrons , a type of fermion with spin 1/2 . Fermi-Dirac statistics are a part of the more general field of statistical mechanics and use the principles of quantum mechanics . The counterpart to F-D statistics is the Bose-Einstein statistics , that apply to bosons ( full integer spin , such as photons , or no spin , like the Higgs boson ) , particles that do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle , meaning that more than one boson can take up the same quantum configuration simultaneously .",
  "/wiki/Beta_decay": "In nuclear physics , beta decay ( \u03b2-decay ) is a type of radioactive decay in which a beta particle ( fast energetic electron or positron ) is emitted from an atomic nucleus , transforming the original nuclide to an isobar . For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron accompanied by an antineutrino ; or , conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron with a neutrino in so-called positron emission . Neither the beta particle nor its associated ( anti- ) neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability . For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible , the energy release ( see below ) or Q value must be positive . Beta decay is a consequence of the weak force , which is characterized by relatively lengthy decay times . Nucleons are composed of up quarks and down quarks , and the weak force allows a quark to change its flavour by emission of a W boson leading to creation of an electron/antineutrino or positron/neutrino pair . For example , a neutron , composed of two down quarks and an up quark , decays to a proton composed of a down quark and two up quarks . Electron capture is sometimes included as a type of beta decay , because the basic nuclear process , mediated by the weak force , is the same . In electron capture , an inner atomic electron is captured by a proton in the nucleus , transforming it into a neutron , and an electron neutrino is released .",
  "/wiki/Emilio_Gino_Segr\u00e8": "Emilio Gino Segr\u00e8 ( 1 February 1905 - 22 April 1989 ) was an Italian-American physicist and Nobel laureate , who discovered the elements technetium and astatine , and the antiproton , a subatomic antiparticle , for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959 . From 1943 to 1946 he worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory as a group leader for the Manhattan Project . He found in April 1944 that Thin Man , the proposed plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon , would not work because of the presence of plutonium-240 impurities . Born in Tivoli , near Rome , Segr\u00e8 studied engineering at the University of Rome La Sapienza before taking up physics in 1927 . Segr\u00e8 was appointed assistant professor of physics at the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936 , becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys . From 1936 to 1938 he was director of the Physics Laboratory at the University of Palermo . After a visit to Ernest O. Lawrence 's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory , he was sent a molybdenum strip from the laboratory 's cyclotron deflector in 1937 , which was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity . After careful chemical and theoretical analysis , Segr\u00e8 was able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element , named technetium , which was the first artificially synthesized chemical element that does not occur in nature . In 1938 , Benito Mussolini 's fascist government passed anti-Semitic laws barring Jews from university positions . As a Jew , Segr\u00e8 was now rendered an indefinite \u00e9migr\u00e9 . At the Berkeley Radiation Lab , Lawrence offered him a job as a research assistant . While at Berkeley , Segr\u00e8 helped discover the element astatine and the isotope plutonium-239 , which was later used to make the Fat Man nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki .",
  "/wiki/Antiproton": "The antiproton , p , ( pronounced p-bar ) is the antiparticle of the proton . Antiprotons are stable , but they are typically short-lived , since any collision with a proton will cause both particles to be annihilated in a burst of energy . The existence of the antiproton with \u22121 electric charge , opposite to the +1 electric charge of the proton , was predicted by Paul Dirac in his 1933 Nobel Prize lecture . Dirac received the Nobel Prize for his 1928 publication of his Dirac equation that predicted the existence of positive and negative solutions to Einstein 's energy equation ( E = m c 2 { \\displaystyle E=mc^ { 2 } } ) and the existence of the positron , the antimatter analog of the electron , with opposite charge and spin . The antiproton was first experimentally confirmed in 1955 at the Bevatron particle accelerator by University of California , Berkeley physicists Emilio Segr\u00e8 and Owen Chamberlain , for which they were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics . In terms of valence quarks , an antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark ( uud ) . The properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton , with the exception that the antiproton has electric charge and magnetic moment that are the opposites of those in the proton . The questions of how matter is different from antimatter , and the relevance of antimatter in explaining how our universe survived the Big Bang , remain open problems - open , in part , due to the relative scarcity of antimatter in today 's universe .",
  "/wiki/Astatine": "Astatine is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol At and atomic number 85 . It is the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth 's crust , occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements . All of astatine 's isotopes are short-lived ; the most stable is astatine-210 , with a half-life of 8.1 hours . A sample of the pure element has never been assembled , because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity . The bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty . Many of them have been estimated based on the element 's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine , and a member of the halogens ( the group of elements including fluorine , chlorine , bromine , and iodine ) . Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal ; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine . Chemically , several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine . It also shows some metallic behavior , including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution ( unlike the lighter halogens ) . The first synthesis of the element was in 1940 by Dale R. Corson , Kenneth Ross MacKenzie , and Emilio G. Segr\u00e8 at the University of California , Berkeley , who named it from the Greek astatos ( \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ) , meaning unstable . Four isotopes of astatine were subsequently found to be naturally occurring , although much less than one gram is present at any given time in the Earth 's crust . Neither the most stable isotope astatine-210 , nor the medically useful astatine-211 , occur naturally ; they can only be produced synthetically , usually by bombarding bismuth-209 with alpha particles .",
  "/wiki/Technetium": "Technetium is a chemical element with the symbol Tc and atomic number 43 . It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive ; none are stable other than the fully ionized state of 97Tc . Nearly all technetium is produced as a synthetic element , and only about 18,000 tons are estimated to exist at any given time in the Earth 's crust . Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore and thorium ore , the most common source , or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores . This silvery gray , crystalline transition metal lies between manganese and rhenium in group 7 of the periodic table , and its chemical properties are intermediate between those of these two adjacent elements . The most common naturally occurring isotope is 99Tc . Many of technetium 's properties were predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev before the element was discovered . Mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name ekamanganese ( Em ) . In 1937 , technetium ( specifically the technetium-97 isotope ) became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced , hence its name ( from the Greek \u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 , meaning synthetic or artificial , + -ium ) . One short-lived gamma ray-emitting nuclear isomer of technetium - technetium-99m - is used in nuclear medicine for a wide variety of diagnostic tests , such as bone cancer diagnoses . The ground state of this nuclide , technetium-99 , is used as a gamma-ray-free source of beta particles . Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of the fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods .",

One of five prizes bequested in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel , it is an award for scientific progress through laboratory discoveries in experimental physiology . The Nobel Prize is presented annually on the anniversary of Nobel 's death , 10 December . As of 2019 , 110 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 207 men and 12 women . The first one was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist Emil von Behring , for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria . The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , Gerty Cori , received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose , important in many aspects of medicine , including treatment of diabetes . The prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award . The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics , Chemistry , and Literature ; the reverse side is unique to this medal .

  "/wiki/Antihistamines": "Antihistamines are drugs which treat allergic rhinitis and other allergies . Typically people take antihistamines as an inexpensive , generic , over-the-counter drug that can provide relief from nasal congestion , sneezing , or hives caused by pollen , dust mites , or animal allergy with few side effects . Antihistamines are usually for short-term treatment . Chronic allergies increase the risk of health problems which antihistamines might not treat , including asthma , sinusitis , and lower respiratory tract infection . Consultation of a medical professional is recommended for those who intend to take antihistamines for longer-term use . Although people typically use the word antihistamine to describe drugs for treating allergies , doctors and scientists use the term to describe a class of drug that opposes the activity of histamine receptors in the body . In this sense of the word , antihistamines are subclassified according to the histamine receptor that they act upon . The two largest classes of antihistamines are H1-antihistamines and H2-antihistamines . H1-antihistamines work by binding to histamine H1 receptors in mast cells , smooth muscle , and endothelium in the body as well as in the tuberomammillary nucleus in the brain . Antihistamines that target the histamine H1-receptor are used to treat allergic reactions in the nose ( e.g. , itching , runny nose , and sneezing ) . In addition , they may be used to treat insomnia , motion sickness , or vertigo caused by problems with the inner ear . H2-antihistamines bind to histamine H2 receptors in the upper gastrointestinal tract , primarily in the stomach .",
  "/wiki/Neurotransmitter": "Neurotransmitters are endogenous chemicals that enable neurotransmission . It is a type of chemical messenger which transmits signals across a chemical synapse , such as a neuromuscular junction , from one neuron ( nerve cell ) to another target neuron , muscle cell , or gland cell .

Many neurotransmitters are synthesized from simple and plentiful precursors such as amino acids , which are readily available from the diet and only require a small number of biosynthetic steps for conversion . Neurotransmitters play a major role in shaping everyday life and functions . Their exact numbers are unknown , but more than 200 unique chemical messengers have been identified .",

Histamine is involved in the inflammatory response and has a central role as a mediator of itching . As part of an immune response to foreign pathogens , histamine is produced by basophils and by mast cells found in nearby connective tissues . Histamine increases the permeability of the capillaries to white blood cells and some proteins , to allow them to engage pathogens in the infected tissues . It consists of an imidazole ring attached to an ethylamine chain ; under physiological conditions , the amino group of the side-chain is protonated .",
  "/wiki/Allergy": "Allergies , also known as allergic diseases , are a number of conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment . These diseases include hay fever , food allergies , atopic dermatitis , allergic asthma , and anaphylaxis . Symptoms may include red eyes , an itchy rash , sneezing , a runny nose , shortness of breath , or swelling . Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions . Common allergens include pollen and certain foods . Metals and other substances may also cause problems . Food , insect stings , and medications are common causes of severe reactions . Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors . The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies ( IgE ) , part of the body 's immune system , binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine . Diagnosis is typically based on a person 's medical history . Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases . Positive tests , however , may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question .",

  "/wiki/Modern_Movement": "Modernism is both a philosophical movement and an art movement that , along with cultural trends and changes , arose from wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in Western society during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities , followed then by reactions to the horrors of World War I. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking , although many modernists also rejected religious belief . Modernism , in general , includes the activities and creations of those who felt the traditional forms of art , architecture , literature , religious faith , philosophy , social organization , activities of daily life , and sciences were becoming ill-fitted to their tasks and outdated in the new economic , social , and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world . The poet Ezra Pound 's 1934 injunction to Make it new ! was the touchstone of the movement 's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past . In this spirit , its innovations , like the stream-of-consciousness novel , atonal ( or pantonal ) and twelve-tone music , divisionist painting and abstract art , all had precursors in the 19th century . A notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social traditions , which often led to experiments with form , along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting , poem , building and other works of art . Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism [ full citation needed ] and made use of the works of the past by the employment of reprise , incorporation , rewriting , recapitulation , revision and parody . While some scholars see modernism continuing into the 21st century , others see it evolving into late modernism or high modernism . Postmodernism is a departure from modernism and refutes its basic assumptions .",

It has no generally accepted definition . Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures ; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof . When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena , mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature . Through the use of abstraction and logic , mathematics developed from counting , calculation , measurement , and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects . Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist . The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry . Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics , most notably in Euclid 's Elements . Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano ( 1858-1932 ) , David Hilbert ( 1862-1943 ) , and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century , it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions . Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance , when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day . Mathematics is essential in many fields , including natural science , engineering , medicine , finance , and the social sciences . Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines , such as statistics and game theory .",

  "/wiki/Minimal_surfaces": "In mathematics , a minimal surface is a surface that locally minimizes its area . This is equivalent to having zero mean curvature ( see definitions below ) . The term minimal surface is used because these surfaces originally arose as surfaces that minimized total surface area subject to some constraint . Physical models of area-minimizing minimal surfaces can be made by dipping a wire frame into a soap solution , forming a soap film , which is a minimal surface whose boundary is the wire frame . However , the term is used for more general surfaces that may self-intersect or do not have constraints . For a given constraint there may also exist several minimal surfaces with different areas ( for example , see minimal surface of revolution ) : the standard definitions only relate to a local optimum , not a global optimum .",

  "/wiki/Astrophysics": "Astrophysics is the branch of astronomy that employs the principles of physics and chemistry to ascertain the nature of the astronomical objects , rather than their positions or motions in space . Among the objects studied are the Sun , other stars , galaxies , extrasolar planets , the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background . Emissions from these objects are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum , and the properties examined include luminosity , density , temperature , and chemical composition . Because astrophysics is a very broad subject , astrophysicists apply concepts and methods from many disciplines of physics , including classical mechanics , electromagnetism , statistical mechanics , thermodynamics , quantum mechanics , relativity , nuclear and particle physics , and atomic and molecular physics . In practice , modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics . Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties of dark matter , dark energy , black holes , and other celestial bodies ; whether or not time travel is possible , wormholes can form , or the multiverse exists ; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe . Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include Solar System formation and evolution ; stellar dynamics and evolution ; galaxy formation and evolution ; magnetohydrodynamics ; large-scale structure of matter in the universe ; origin of cosmic rays ; general relativity , special relativity , quantum and physical cosmology , including string cosmology and astroparticle physics .",

In the same year , he began to develop the theory of dislocations in crystals that was later to become important in the understanding of the behaviour of ductile materials . On the outbreak of World War I , already well into his 50s , he joined the Italian Army and worked on the development of airships under Giulio Douhet . He originated the idea of using inert helium rather than flammable hydrogen and made use of his leadership abilities in organising its manufacture . After World War I , Volterra turned his attention to the application of his mathematical ideas to biology , principally reiterating and developing the work of Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Verhulst . An outcome of this period is the Lotka-Volterra equations . Volterra is the only person who was a plenary speaker in the International Congress of Mathematicians four times ( 1900 , 1908 , 1920 , 1928 ) .",

  "/wiki/Gabriele_d'Annunzio": "D'Annunzio was born in the township of Pescara , in the region of Abruzzo , the son of a wealthy landowner and mayor of the town . Francesco Paolo Rapagnetta D'Annunzio ( 1831-1893 ) and his wife Luisa de Benedictis ( 1839-1917 ) . His father had originally been born plain Rapagnetta ( the name of his single mother ) , but at the age of 13 had been adopted by a childless rich uncle Antonio D'Annunzio . Legend has it that he was initially baptized Gaetano and given the name of Gabriele later in childhood , because of his angelic looks , a story that has largely been disproven . His precocious talent was recognised early in life , and he was sent to school at the Liceo Cicognini in Prato , Tuscany . He published his first poetry while still at school at the age of sixteen - a small volume of verses called Primo Vere ( 1879 ) . Influenced by Giosu\u00e8 Carducci 's Odi barbare , he posed side by side some almost brutal imitations of Lorenzo Stecchetti , the fashionable poet of Postuma , with translations from the Latin . His verse was distinguished by such agile grace that Giuseppe Chiarini on reading them brought the unknown youth before the public in an enthusiastic article . In 1881 D'Annunzio entered the University of Rome La Sapienza , where he became a member of various literary groups , including Cronaca Bizantina , and wrote articles and criticism for local newspapers . In those university years he started to promote Italian irredentism .",
  "/wiki/Decadent_movement": "The Decadent movement was a late-19th-century artistic and literary movement , centered in Western Europe , that followed an aesthetic ideology of excess and artificiality . The visual artist F\u00e9licien Rops 's body of work and Joris-Karl Huysmans 's novel Against Nature ( 1884 ) are considered the prime examples of the decadent movement . It first flourished in France and then spread throughout Europe and to the United States . The movement was characterized by self-disgust , sickness at the world , general skepticism , delight in perversion and employment of crude humor and a belief in the superiority of human creativity over logic and the natural world .",

His aliases include Charles Ponci , Carlo , and Charles P. Bianchi . Born and raised in Italy , he became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme . He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days or 100% profit within 90 days , by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage . In reality , Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors . While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by Ponzi , it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a Ponzi scheme . His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed , costing his investors $ 20 million . Ponzi may have been inspired by the scheme of William F. Miller ( also known as 520% Miller ) , a Brooklyn bookkeeper who in 1899 used a similar deception to take in $ 1 million .",
  "/wiki/Ponzi_scheme": "A Ponzi scheme ( /\u02c8p\u0252nzi/ , Italian : [ \u02c8pontsi ] ; also a Ponzi game ) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors . The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means , and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds . A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds , and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own . The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi , who became notorious for using the technique in the 1920s . The idea had already been carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the Ladies ' Deposit . Howe offered a solely female clientele an eight-percent monthly interest rate , and then stole the money that the women had invested . She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison . The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels ; Charles Dickens ' 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and his 1857 novel Little Dorrit both feature such a scheme . Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in . His original scheme was based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps , but he soon began diverting new investors ' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself .",

It is a forum of countries describing themselves as committed to democracy and the market economy , providing a platform to compare policy experiences , seek answers to common problems , identify good practices and coordinate domestic and international policies of its members . Most OECD members are high-income economies with a very high Human Development Index ( HDI ) and are regarded as developed countries . As of 2017 , the OECD member countries collectively comprised 62.2% of global nominal GDP ( US $ 49.6 trillion ) and 42.8% of global GDP ( Int $ 54.2 trillion ) at purchasing power parity . The OECD is an official United Nations observer . In 1948 , the OECD originated as the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation ( OEEC ) , led by Robert Marjolin of France , to help administer the Marshall Plan ( which was rejected by the Soviet Union and its satellite states ) . This would be achieved by allocating United States financial aid and implementing economic programs for the reconstruction of Europe after World War II . ( Similar reconstruction aid was sent to the war-torn Republic of China and post-war Korea , but not under the name Marshall Plan . ) In 1961 , the OEEC was reformed into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by the Convention on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and membership was extended to non-European states . The OECD 's headquarters are at the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette in Paris , France . The OECD is funded by contributions from member countries at varying rates and had a total budget of \u20ac386 million in 2019 ."
