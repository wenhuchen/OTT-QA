He is a former Asian record holder in the 200 metres and 4\u00d7100 metres relay . Suetsugu won a bronze medal in the 200 metres event at the 2003 IAAF World Championships in a time of 20.38 seconds . The same year he set an Asian record of 20.03 seconds at the Japanese national championships , and also won the 100 metres in 10.13 seconds . Participating in the 2004 Summer Olympics , he reached the second round in the 100 metres . Suetsugu represented Japan at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing . He competed at the 4\u00d7100 metres relay together with Naoki Tsukahara , Shinji Takahira and Nobuharu Asahara . In their qualification heat they placed second behind Trinidad and Tobago , but in front of the Netherlands and Brazil . Their time of 38.52 was the third fastest out of sixteen participating nations in the first round , and they qualified for the final . There they sprinted to a time of 38.15 seconds , the third fastest after the Jamaican and Trinidad teams , winning the bronze medal . The medal was upgraded to a silver after the Jamaicans were DQ'ed due to Nesta Carter 's positive doping sample . He also took part in the 200 metres individual , finishing sixth in his first round heat , with a time of 20.93 seconds , which was not enough to qualify for the second round .",
  "/wiki/200_metres": "The 200 metres ( also spelt 200 meters ) is a sprint running event . On an outdoor race 400 m track , the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight , so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race . A slightly shorter race , called the stadion and run on a straight track , was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games . The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes predominantly rely on anaerobic energy system during the 200 m sprint . Similarly to other sprint distances , the 200 m begins from the starting blocks . When the sprinters adopt the 'set ' position in the blocks they are able to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles . This enables them to stride forwards more powerfully when the race begins and start faster . In the United States and elsewhere , athletes previously ran the 220-yard dash ( 201.168 m ) instead of the 200 m ( 218.723 yards ) , though the distance is now obsolete . The standard adjustment used for the conversion from times recorded over 220 yards to 200 m times is to subtract 0.1 seconds , but other conversion methods exist . Another obsolete version of this race is the 200 metres straight , which was run on tracks that contained such a straight . Initially , when the International Amateur Athletic Association ( now known as the International Association of Athletics Federations ) started to ratify world records in 1912 , only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration . In 1951 , the IAAF started to recognise records set on a curved track .",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese . The kanji ( or Chinese characters ) that make up the name of Japan in the Japanese language mean sun origin ; in the Western world , the country is often known by the sobriquet Land of the Rising Sun . Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD . Between the fourth and ninth centuries , the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under an Emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d ( modern Kyoto ) .",

China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

  "/wiki/400_metres": "The 400 metres , or 400 metre dash , is a sprinting event in track and field competitions . It has been featured in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1964 for women . On a standard outdoor running track , it is one lap around the track . Runners start in staggered positions and race in separate lanes for the entire course . In many countries , athletes previously competed in the 440 yard dash ( 402.336 m ) - which is a quarter of a mile and was referred to as the 'quarter-mile ' - instead of the 400 m ( 437.445 yards ) , though this distance is now obsolete . Like other sprint disciplines , the 400 m involves the use of starting blocks . The runners take up position in the blocks on the 'ready ' command , adopt a more efficient starting posture which isometrically preloads their muscles on the 'set ' command , and stride forwards from the blocks upon hearing the starter 's pistol . The blocks allow the runners to begin more powerfully and thereby contribute to their overall sprint speed capability . Maximum sprint speed capability is a significant contributing factor to success in the event , but athletes also require substantial speed endurance and the ability to cope well with high amounts of lactic acid to sustain a fast speed over a whole lap . While considered to be predominantly an anaerobic event , there is some aerobic involvement and the degree of aerobic training required for 400 metre athletes is open to debate . The current men 's world record is held by Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa , with a time of 43.03 seconds ; van Niekerk is also the Olympic champion .

During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track , therefore requiring four laps . The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile ( 880 yards ) , a traditional English racing distance . Imperial racing distances were common in the United States . American high schools ( in the name of the NFHS ) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980 , following the NCAA 's conversion in 1976 . Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the 1966 Commonwealth Games . 800 m is 4.67 m less than half a mile . The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed . Both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are being taxed to a high extent , thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems . Runners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the 400 metres or the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay but only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m.
