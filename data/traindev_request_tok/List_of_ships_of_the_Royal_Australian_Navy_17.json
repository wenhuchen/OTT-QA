  "/wiki/Bathurst-class_corvette": "The Bathurst-class corvettes were a class of general purpose vessels produced in Australia during World War II . Originally classified as minesweepers , but widely referred to as corvettes , the Bathurst-class vessels fulfilled a broad anti-submarine , anti-mine , and convoy escort role . Sixty Bathurst-class corvettes were built in eight Australian shipyards to an Australian design . 36 were constructed for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , 20 were built on British Admiralty orders but manned and commissioned by the RAN , and 4 served in the Royal Indian Navy . Three more were ordered for construction in India , but were cancelled . Although designed for the anti-submarine and anti-mine role , the Bathursts operated as maids-of-all-work during the war ; serving as troop and supply transports , supporting amphibious landings , providing air defence for convoys and disabled ships , participating in shore bombardments , and undertaking hydrographic surveys . Three ships were lost during the war - one to Japanese air attack and two to collisions with friendly merchant ships - while a fourth struck a friendly mine while sweeping the Great Barrier Reef in 1947 and sank . After the war , the Admiralty ships were sold to the Turkish Navy , Royal Netherlands Navy , and civilian operators , while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy , temporarily reactivated to facilitate National Service Training , or sold to civilians . Four of the Netherlands Bathursts were sold onward to the Indonesian Navy , one of which was destroyed in 1956 by rebels opposing the 'Guided Democracy ' political system . The rest of the RAN and Admiralty ships were sold for scrap to help fund other projects . Two vessels are preserved as museum ships .",

Temporarily commissioned into the Royal Navy for the delivery voyage to Australia , the destroyer came under Australian naval control in 1910 , and was recommissioned into the RAN on 1 March 1911 , shortly before the latter 's formal creation . After the beginning of the First World War in 1914 until 1917 , Parramatta was conducted patrols in the Pacific and South-East Asia , before she and her sister ships were transferred to the Mediterranean for anti-submarine operations . She returned to Australia in 1919 and was placed in reserve . Apart from a brief period of full commission during the visit of the Prince of Wales in 1920 , Parramatta remained in reserve until 1928 . She was fully decommissioned in 1928 , stripped of parts , and sold for use as prisoner accommodation on the Hawkesbury River .

  "/wiki/Royal_Navy": "The Royal Navy ( RN ) is the United Kingdom 's naval warfare force . Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period , the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years ' War against the Kingdom of France . The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century ; the oldest of the UK 's armed services , it is known as the Senior Service . From the middle decades of the 17th century , and through the 18th century , the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy . From the mid 18th century , it was the world 's most powerful navy until the Second World War . The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries . Due to this historical prominence , it is common , even among non-Britons , to refer to it as the Royal Navy without qualification . Following World War I , the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size , although at the onset of World War II it was still the world 's largest . During the Cold War , the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force , hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap . Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world 's foremost blue-water navies . However , 21st-century reductions in naval spending have led to a personnel shortage and a reduction in the number of warships . The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships and submarines including two aircraft carriers , two amphibious transport docks , four ballistic missile submarines ( which maintain the UK 's nuclear deterrent ) , six nuclear fleet submarines , six guided missile destroyers , 13 frigates , 13 mine-countermeasure vessels and 22 patrol vessels .",

Encounter operated in the New Guinea , Fiji-Samoa , and Malaya areas until 1916 , when she returned to Australian waters . The ship spent the rest of the war patrolling and escorting convoys around Australia and into the Indian Ocean . In 1919 , Encounter was sent to evacuate the Administrator of the Northern Territory and his family following the Darwin Rebellion .

At the start of World War II in September , the ship patrolled the Western Atlantic and the Caribbean in search of German shipping and escorting convoys for six months before she was ordered home in early 1940 . The ship continued the same types of duties in Australian waters before she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1940 . Perth then helped to escort numerous convoys to Malta in early 1941 and played a minor role in the Battle of Cape Matapan in March . She escorted convoys to Greece and Crete and helped to evacuate Allied troops from both places in the face of the victorious Axis forces . The ship was badly damaged by Axis aircraft in May during the evacuation of Crete . After repairs were completed in June , Perth provided naval gunfire support to Allied forces ashore during the Syria-Lebanon Campaign and bombarded Vichy French targets . She returned to Australia in mid-1941 and was tasked with the same sorts of missions as she had been performing at the beginning of the war .

East Thrace , the part of Turkey in Europe , is separated from Anatolia by the Sea of Marmara , the Bosporus and the Dardanelles ( collectively called the Turkish Straits ) . Istanbul , mostly located on the European side , is the largest city in the country while Ankara is the capital . Turkey is bordered by Greece and Bulgaria to its northwest , the Black Sea to its north , Georgia to its northeast , Armenia , the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to its east , Iraq and Syria to its southeast , the Mediterranean Sea to its south , and the Aegean Sea to its west . Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power .",
