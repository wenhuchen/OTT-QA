After 52 years in St. Louis , the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney and civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro , Jr . The team 's current owner is American trial lawyer Peter Angelos . The Orioles adopted their team name in honor of the official state bird of Maryland ; it had also been used by several previous major and minor league baseball clubs in Baltimore , including another AL charter member franchise also named the Baltimore Orioles , which moved north in 1903 to eventually become the New York Yankees . Nicknames for the team include the O 's and the Birds . The Orioles experienced their greatest success from 1966 to 1983 , when they made six World Series appearances , winning three of them ( 1966 , 1970 , 1983 ) . This era of the club featured several future Hall of Famers who would later be inducted representing the Orioles , such as third baseman Brooks Robinson , outfielder Frank Robinson , starting pitcher Jim Palmer , first baseman Eddie Murray , shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. , and manager Earl Weaver . The Orioles have won a total of nine division championships ( 1969-1971 , 1973-1974 , 1979 , 1983 , 1997 , 2014 ) , six pennants ( 1966 , 1969-1971 , 1979 , 1983 ) , and three wild card berths ( 1996 , 2012 , 2016 ) . Since moving to Baltimore in 1954 , the franchise has a win-loss record of 5306-5174 ( with a winning percentage of .506 ) as of the end of the 2019 season . After suffering a stretch of 14 straight losing seasons from 1998 to 2011 , the team qualified for the postseason three times under manager Buck Showalter and general manager Dan Duquette , including a division title and advancement to the American League Championship Series for the first time in 17 years in 2014 .",

He was nicknamed Zamboni for his skill at scooping up ground balls on the artificial turf of Busch Memorial Stadium . Selected in the 31st round in 1969 as the 730th player , Reitz , in his rookie season of 1973 , replaced Joe Torre as the Cardinals ' starting third baseman . In both 1973 and 1974 , he led all National League third basemen in fielding percentage . In 1975 he won a Gold Glove Award at the position , breaking Doug Rader 's streak of five consecutive Gold Gloves . It would be the last Gold Glove by a National League third baseman prior to Mike Schmidt 's nine-year run of the Award . In 1977 he set a National League record by committing only nine errors ; he bettered that record by committing only eight in 1980 . In this latter year , he also made his only All-Star appearance , where he started at third base in place of an injured Schmidt . Reitz holds the record for most career plate appearances ( 5079 ) among non-catchers who finished their careers with fewer walks than times he grounded into a double play .
