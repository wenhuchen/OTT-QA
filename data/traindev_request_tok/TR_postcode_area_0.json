Like many other Cornish villages near the coast , Pendeen had a reputation for smuggling activities . Pendeen is overlooked by a hill , Carn Eanes , referred to locally as 'The Carn ' , the site of a quarry which provided the granite to build Pendeen church . Pendeen lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( AONB ) . Pendeen is close ( 1 km ) to the South West Coast Path and in addition has a number of local footpaths for exploring the surroundings .",
