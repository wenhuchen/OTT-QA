On January 30 , 1945 , during World War II , United States Army Rangers , Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas liberated more than 500 from the POW camp . After the surrender of tens of thousands of American troops during the Battle of Bataan , many were sent to the Cabanatuan prison camp after the Bataan Death March . The Japanese shifted most of the prisoners to other areas , leaving just over 500 American and other Allied POWs and civilians in the prison . Facing brutal conditions including disease , torture , and malnourishment , the prisoners feared they would be executed by their captors before the arrival of General Douglas MacArthur and his American forces returning to Luzon . In late January 1945 , a plan was developed by Sixth Army leaders and Filipino guerrillas to send a small force to rescue the prisoners . A group of over 100 Rangers and Scouts and 200 guerrillas traveled 30 miles ( 48 km ) behind Japanese lines to reach the camp . In a nighttime raid , under the cover of darkness and with distraction by a P-61 Black Widow night fighter , the group surprised the Japanese forces in and around the camp . Hundreds of Japanese troops were killed in the 30-minute coordinated attack ; the Americans suffered minimal casualties . The Rangers , Scouts , and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines . The rescue allowed the prisoners to tell of the death march and prison camp atrocities , which sparked a rush of resolve for the war against Japan .

It consisted of the Heer ( army ) , the Kriegsmarine ( navy ) and the Luftwaffe ( air force ) . The designation Wehrmacht replaced the previously used term Reichswehr , and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime 's efforts to rearm Germany to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted . After the Nazi rise to power in 1933 , one of Adolf Hitler 's most overt and audacious moves was to establish the Wehrmacht , a modern offensively-capable armed force , fulfilling the Nazi regime 's long-term goals of regaining lost territory as well as gaining new territory and dominating its neighbours . This required the reinstatement of conscription , and massive investment and defense spending on the arms industry . The Wehrmacht formed the heart of Germany 's politico-military power . In the early part of the Second World War , the Wehrmacht employed combined arms tactics ( close cover air-support , tanks , and infantry ) to devastating effect in what became known as Blitzkrieg ( lightning war ) . Its campaigns in France ( 1940 ) , the Soviet Union ( 1941 ) , and North Africa ( 1941/42 ) are regarded as acts of boldness . At the same time , the far-flung advances strained the Wehrmacht 's capacity to the breaking point , culminating in the first major defeat in the Battle of Moscow ( 1941 ) ; by late 1942 , Germany was losing the initiative in all theatres . The operational art was no match to the war-making abilities of the Allied coalition , making the Wehrmacht 's weaknesses in strategy , doctrine , and logistics readily apparent . Closely cooperating with the SS and the Einsatzgruppen , the German armed forces committed numerous war crimes , despite later denials and promotion of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht .",

  "/wiki/Swedish_neutrality": "Swedish neutrality refers to Sweden 's former policy of neutrality in armed conflicts , which was in effect from the early 19th century , until 2009 , when Sweden entered into various mutual defence treaties with the EU , and other Nordic countries . In 2016 Sweden became a NATO Affiliate ( not member ) , and signed a treaty allowing NATO operations to take place within the country 's borders . Sweden 's previous neutrality policy had originated largely as a result of Sweden 's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars during which over a third of the country 's territory was lost , including the traumatic loss of Finland to Russia . Resentment towards the old king precipitated a coup d'\u00e9tat and the new regime formulated a new foreign policy which became known as The Policy of 1812 . Since the time of the Napoleonic Wars , Sweden has not initiated any direct armed conflict . However , Sweden 's military and government have been involved in major peacekeeping actions and other military support functions around the world . The accession to the European Union in 1995 meant that neutrality as a principle was abolished . Sweden is still today a neutral and non-aligned country in regard to foreign and security policy . However , it maintains strong links to NATO . Nevertheless , the Swedish neutrality during World War II has been much debated and challenged later . Despite the British naval blockade of Nazi Germany and the official proposed intentions from the Swedish government to maintain political neutrality , Sweden exported iron ore to supply Nazi Germany 's war industry via the Norwegian port of Narvik . Nazi Germany 's war industry 's dependence on Swedish iron ore shipments was the primary reason for Great Britain and their allies to launch their Operation Wilfred and the Norwegian Campaign in early April 1940 .",

[ o ] However , he was ousted from Congress leadership positions in 1939 following differences with Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress high command . He was subsequently placed under house arrest by the British before escaping from India in 1940 . Bose arrived in Germany in April 1941 , where the leadership offered unexpected , if sometimes ambivalent , sympathy for the cause of India 's independence , contrasting starkly with its attitudes towards other colonised peoples and ethnic communities . In November 1941 , with German funds , a Free India Centre was set up in Berlin , and soon a Free India Radio , on which Bose broadcast nightly . A 3,000-strong Free India Legion , comprising Indians captured by Erwin Rommel 's Afrika Korps , was also formed to aid in a possible future German land invasion of India . By spring 1942 , in light of Japanese victories in southeast Asia and changing German priorities , a German invasion of India became untenable , and Bose became keen to move to southeast Asia . Adolf Hitler , during his only meeting with Bose in late May 1942 , suggested the same , and offered to arrange for a submarine .
