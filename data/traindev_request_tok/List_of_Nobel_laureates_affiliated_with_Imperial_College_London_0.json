One of five prizes bequested in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel , it is an award for scientific progress through laboratory discoveries in experimental physiology . The Nobel Prize is presented annually on the anniversary of Nobel 's death , 10 December . As of 2019 , 110 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 207 men and 12 women . The first one was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist Emil von Behring , for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria . The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , Gerty Cori , received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose , important in many aspects of medicine , including treatment of diabetes . The prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award . The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics , Chemistry , and Literature ; the reverse side is unique to this medal . The most recent Nobel prize was announced by Karolinska Institute on 7 October 2019 , and has been awarded to Americans William Kaelin Jr. , Gregg L. Semenza and British Peter J. Ratcliffe - for their discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability . Some awards have been controversial . This includes one to Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz in 1949 for the prefrontal lobotomy , bestowed despite protests from the medical establishment .

  "/wiki/Vitamin": "A vitamin is an organic molecule ( or related set of molecules ) that is an essential micronutrient that an organism needs in small quantities for the proper functioning of its metabolism . Essential nutrients can not be synthesized in the organism , either at all or not in sufficient quantities , and therefore must be obtained through the diet . Vitamin C can be synthesized by some species but not by others ; it is not a vitamin in the first instance but is in the second . The term vitamin does not include the three other groups of essential nutrients : minerals , essential fatty acids , and essential amino acids . Most vitamins are not single molecules , but groups of related molecules called vitamers . For example , vitamin E consists of four tocopherols and four tocotrienols . The thirteen vitamins required by human metabolism are vitamin A ( as all-trans-retinol , all-trans-retinyl-esters , as well as all-trans-beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids ) , vitamin B1 ( thiamine ) , vitamin B2 ( riboflavin ) , vitamin B3 ( niacin ) , vitamin B5 ( pantothenic acid ) , vitamin B6 ( pyridoxine ) , vitamin B7 ( biotin ) , vitamin B9 ( folic acid or folate ) , vitamin B12 ( cobalamins ) , vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) , vitamin D ( calciferols ) , vitamin E ( tocopherols and tocotrienols ) , and vitamin K ( quinones ) . Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions . Vitamin A acts as a regulator of cell and tissue growth and differentiation . Vitamin D provides a hormone-like function , regulating mineral metabolism for bones and other organs . The B complex vitamins function as enzyme cofactors ( coenzymes ) or the precursors for them . Vitamins C and E function as antioxidants .",

  "/wiki/Electron_diffraction": "Electron diffraction refers to the wave nature of electrons . However , from a technical or practical point of view , it may be regarded as a technique used to study matter by firing electrons at a sample and observing the resulting interference pattern . This phenomenon is commonly known as wave-particle duality , which states that a particle of matter ( in this case the incident electron ) can be described as a wave . For this reason , an electron can be regarded as a wave much like sound or water waves . This technique is similar to X-ray and neutron diffraction . Electron diffraction is most frequently used in solid state physics and chemistry to study the crystal structure of solids . Experiments are usually performed in a transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) , or a scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) as electron backscatter diffraction . In these instruments , electrons are accelerated by an electrostatic potential in order to gain the desired energy and determine their wavelength before they interact with the sample to be studied . The periodic structure of a crystalline solid acts as a diffraction grating , scattering the electrons in a predictable manner . Working back from the observed diffraction pattern , it may be possible to deduce the structure of the crystal producing the diffraction pattern . However , the technique is limited by phase problem . Apart from the study of periodically perfect crystals , i.e .",

It was Florey and Chain who actually made a useful and effective drug out of penicillin , after the task had been abandoned as too difficult . Florey 's discoveries , along with the discoveries of Fleming and Ernst Chain , are estimated to have saved over 200 million lives , and he is consequently regarded by the Australian scientific and medical community as one of its greatest figures .

  "/wiki/Penicillin": "Penicillin ( PCN or pen ) is a group of antibiotics , derived originally from common moulds known as Penicillium moulds ; which includes penicillin G ( intravenous use ) , penicillin V ( use by mouth ) , procaine penicillin , and benzathine penicillin ( intramuscular use ) . Penicillin antibiotics were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci . They are still widely used today , though many types of bacteria have developed resistance following extensive use . About 10% of people report that they are allergic to penicillin ; however , up to 90% of this group may not actually be allergic . Serious allergies only occur in about 0.03% . Those who are allergic to penicillin are most often given cephalosporin C because of its functional groups . All penicillins are \u03b2-lactam antibiotics , which are some of the most powerful and successful achievements in modern science . Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming . People began using it to treat infections in 1942 .

  "/wiki/Chemical_reaction": "A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the chemical transformation of one set of chemical substances to another . Classically , chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms , with no change to the nuclei ( no change to the elements present ) , and can often be described by a chemical equation . Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes can occur . The substance ( or substances ) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents . Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change , and they yield one or more products , which usually have properties different from the reactants . Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps , the so-called elementary reactions , and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism . Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations , which symbolically present the starting materials , end products , and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions . Chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration . Typically , reaction rates increase with increasing temperature because there is more thermal energy available to reach the activation energy necessary for breaking bonds between atoms . Reactions may proceed in the forward or reverse direction until they go to completion or reach equilibrium . Reactions that proceed in the forward direction to approach equilibrium are often described as spontaneous , requiring no input of free energy to go forward . Non-spontaneous reactions require input of free energy to go forward ( examples include charging a battery by applying an external electrical power source , or photosynthesis driven by absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the form of sunlight ) .",

  "/wiki/Flash_photolysis": "Flash photolysis is a pump-probe laboratory technique , in which a sample is firstly excited by a strong pulse ( called pump pulse ) of light from a pulsed laser of nanosecond , picosecond , or femtosecond pulse width or by another short-pulse light source such as a flash lamp . This first strong pulse is called the pump pulse and starts a chemical reaction or leads to an increased population for energy levels other than the ground state within a sample of atoms or molecules . Typically the absorption of light by the sample is recorded within short time intervals ( by a so-called test or probe pulses ) to monitor relaxation or reaction processes initiated by the pump pulse . Flash photolysis was developed shortly after World War II as a result of the military 's attempts to build cameras fast enough to photograph missiles in flight . The technique was developed in 1949 by Manfred Eigen , Ronald George Wreyford Norrish and George Porter , who won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this invention . Over the next 40 years the technique became more powerful and sophisticated due to developments in optics and lasers . Also , the interest in this method grew considerably as the practical applications expanded from chemistry to areas such as biology , materials science , and environmental sciences .

  "/wiki/Conformational_isomerism": "In chemistry , conformational isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism in which the isomers can be interconverted just by rotations about formally single bonds ( refer to figure on single bond rotation ) . While any two arrangements of atoms in a molecule that differ by rotation about single bonds can be referred to as different conformations , conformations that correspond to local minima on the energy surface are specifically called conformational isomers or conformers . Conformations that correspond to local maxima on the energy surface are the transition states between the local-minimum conformational isomers . Rotations about single bonds involve overcoming a rotational energy barrier to interconvert one conformer to another . If the energy barrier is low , there is free rotation and a sample of the compound exists as a rapidly equilibrating mixture of multiple conformers ; if the energy barrier is high enough then there is restricted rotation , a molecule may exist for a relatively long time period as a stable rotational isomer or rotamer ( an isomer arising from hindered single-bond rotation ) . When the time scale for interconversion is long enough for isolation of individual rotamers ( usually arbitrarily defined as a half-life of interconversion of 1000 seconds or longer ) , the isomers are termed atropisomers ( see : atropisomerism ) . The ring-flip of substituted cyclohexanes constitutes another common form of conformational isomerism . Conformational isomers are thus distinct from the other classes of stereoisomers ( i. e. configurational isomers ) where interconversion necessarily involves breaking and reforming of chemical bonds . For example , L/D- and R/S- configurations of organic molecules have different handedness and optical activities , and can only be interconverted by breaking one or more bonds connected to the chiral atom and reforming a similar bond in a different direction or spatial orientation . They also differ from geometric ( cis/trans ) isomers , another class of stereoisomers , which require the \u03c0-component of double bonds to break for interconversion . ( Although the distinction is not always clear-cut , since certain bonds that are formally single bonds actually have double bond character that becomes apparent only when secondary resonance contributors are considered , like the C-N bonds of amides , for instance . ) Due to rapid interconversion , conformers are usually not isolable at room temperature .",

  "/wiki/Holography": "A hologram is a physical recording of an interference pattern which uses diffraction to reproduce a three-dimensional light field , resulting in an image which retains the depth , parallax , and other properties of the original scene . Holography is the science and practice of making holograms . A hologram is a photographic recording of a light field , rather than an image formed by a lens . The holographic medium , i.e. , the object produced by a holographic process ( which itself may be referred to as a hologram ) is usually unintelligible when viewed under diffuse ambient light . It is an encoding of the light field as an interference pattern of variations in the opacity , density , or surface profile of the photographic medium . When suitably lit , the interference pattern diffracts the light into an accurate reproduction of the original light field , and the objects that were in it exhibit visual depth cues such as parallax and perspective that change realistically with the relative position of the observer . That is , the view of the image from different angles represents the subject viewed from similar angles.In this sense , holograms do not simply produce the illusion of depth but are truly three-dimensional images . In its pure form , holography requires the use of laser light for illuminating the subject and for viewing the finished hologram . A microscopic level of detail throughout the recorded scene can be reproduced . In common practice , however , major image quality compromises are made to eliminate the need for laser illumination to view the hologram , and in some cases , to make it . Holographic portraiture often resorts to a non-holographic intermediate imaging procedure , to avoid the hazardous high-powered pulsed lasers otherwise needed to optically freeze moving subjects as perfectly as the extremely motion-intolerant holographic recording process requires . Holograms can now also be entirely computer-generated to show objects or scenes that never existed .",

  "/wiki/Antibodies": "An antibody ( Ab ) , also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , is a large , Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses . The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen , called an antigen , via the fragment antigen-binding ( Fab ) variable region . Each tip of the Y of an antibody contains a paratope ( analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision . Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by inhibiting a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) . Depending on the antigen , the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance . The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region ( located at the base of the Y ) , which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions . The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system . Antibodies are secreted by B cells of the adaptive immune system , mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells . Antibodies can occur in two physical forms , a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma , and a membrane-bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B-cell receptor ( BCR ) . The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure . In most cases , interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and , therefore , antibody generation following antigen binding . Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids , as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms .",

  "/wiki/Abdus_Salam": "Mohammad Abdus Salam NI , SPk , KBE ( /s\u00e6\u02c8l\u00e6m/ ; Punjabi , Urdu : \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 , pronounced [ \u0259bd\u032a\u028as s\u0259la\u02d0m ] ; 29 January 1926 - 21 November 1996 ) , was a Pakistani theoretical physicist . He shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics with Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg for his contribution to the electroweak unification theory . He was the first Pakistani to receive a Nobel Prize in science and the second from an Islamic country to receive any Nobel Prize ( after Anwar Sadat of Egypt ) . Salam was science advisor to the Ministry of Science and Technology in Pakistan from 1960 to 1974 , a position from which he was supposed to play a major and influential role in the development of the country 's science infrastructure . Salam contributed to developments in theoretical and particle physics . He was the founding director of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission ( SUPARCO ) , and responsible for the establishment of the Theoretical Physics Group ( TPG ) in the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission ( PAEC ) . As Science Advisor , Salam played a role in Pakistan 's development of the peaceful use of nuclear energy , and may have contributed as well to development of atomic bomb project of Pakistan in 1972 ; for this , he is viewed as the scientific father of this programme . In 1974 , Abdus Salam departed from his country , in protest , after the Parliament of Pakistan passed unanimously a parliamentary bill declaring members of the Ahmadiyya movement to which Salam belonged non-Muslims . In 1998 , following the country 's nuclear tests , the Government of Pakistan issued a commemorative stamp , as a part of Scientists of Pakistan , to honour the services of Salam . Salam 's notable achievements include the Pati-Salam model , magnetic photon , vector meson , Grand Unified Theory , work on supersymmetry and , most importantly , electroweak theory , for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize . Salam made a major contribution in quantum field theory and in the advancement of Mathematics at Imperial College London . With his student , Riazuddin , Salam made important contributions to the modern theory on neutrinos , neutron stars and black holes , as well as the work on modernising the quantum mechanics and quantum field theory .",

He holds the Josey Regental Chair in Science at the University of Texas at Austin , where he is a member of the Physics and Astronomy Departments . His research on elementary particles and physical cosmology has been honored with numerous prizes and awards , including in 1979 the Nobel Prize in Physics and in 1991 the National Medal of Science . In 2004 he received the Benjamin Franklin Medal of the American Philosophical Society , with a citation that said he is considered by many to be the preeminent theoretical physicist alive in the world today . He has been elected to the US National Academy of Sciences and Britain 's Royal Society , as well as to the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . Weinberg 's articles on various subjects occasionally appear in The New York Review of Books and other periodicals . He has served as consultant at the U. S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency , President of the Philosophical Society of Texas , and member of the Board of Editors of Daedalus magazine , the Council of Scholars of the Library of Congress , the JASON group of defense consultants , and many other boards and committees .",
  "/wiki/Electroweak_force": "In particle physics , the electroweak interaction is the unified description of two of the four known fundamental interactions of nature : electromagnetism and the weak interaction . Although these two forces appear very different at everyday low energies , the theory models them as two different aspects of the same force . Above the unification energy , on the order of 246 GeV , [ a ] they would merge into a single electroweak force . Thus , if the universe is hot enough ( approximately 1015 K , a temperature not exceeded since shortly after the Big Bang ) , then the electromagnetic force and weak force merge into a combined electroweak force . During the quark epoch , the electroweak force split into the electromagnetic and weak force . Sheldon Glashow , Abdus Salam , and Steven Weinberg were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for their contributions to the unification of the weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles , known as the Weinberg-Salam theory . The existence of the electroweak interactions was experimentally established in two stages , the first being the discovery of neutral currents in neutrino scattering by the Gargamelle collaboration in 1973 , and the second in 1983 by the UA1 and the UA2 collaborations that involved the discovery of the W and Z gauge bosons in proton-antiproton collisions at the converted Super Proton Synchrotron . In 1999 , Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus Veltman were awarded the Nobel prize for showing that the electroweak theory is renormalizable .",
  "/wiki/Weak_neutral_current": "Weak neutral current interactions are one of the ways in which subatomic particles can interact by means of the weak force . These interactions are mediated by the Z boson . The discovery of weak neutral currents was a significant step toward the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force , and led to the discovery of the W and Z bosons ."
