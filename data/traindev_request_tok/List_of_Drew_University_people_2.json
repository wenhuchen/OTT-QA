Settled in 1788 , the city is located at the northern side of the confluence of the Licking and Ohio rivers , the latter of which marks the state line with Kentucky . The city is the economic and cultural hub of the Cincinnati metropolitan area , the fastest growing economic power in the Midwestern United States based on increase of economic output , which had a population of 2,190,209 as of the 2018 census estimates . This makes it Ohio 's largest metropolitan area and the nation 's 29th-largest . With a city population estimated at 302,605 , Cincinnati is the third-largest city in Ohio and 65th in the United States . Cincinnati is also within a day 's drive of 49.70% of the United States populace , the most of any city in the United States . In the 19th century , Cincinnati was an American boomtown in the middle of the country . Throughout much of the 19th century , it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population , surpassed only by New Orleans and the older , established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard , as well as being the sixth-biggest city for a period spanning 1840 until 1860 . Cincinnati was the first city founded after the American Revolution , as well as the first major inland city in the country . Cincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period . However , it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants , who founded many of the city 's cultural institutions . By the end of the 19th century , with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping , trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati 's growth slowed considerably .",

It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language , spanning at least 3,500 years of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic , and many other writing systems . The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics . During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world , West Asia and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , Greek is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , and Turkey and by the Greek diaspora . Greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages ; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary .",

H\u0113 Kain\u1e15 Diath\u1e17k\u0113 ; Latin : Novum Testamentum ) is the second part of the Christian biblical canon , the first being the Old Testament . The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus , as well as events in first-century Christianity . Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture . The New Testament is a collection of Christian texts originally written in the Koine Greek language , at different times by various different authors . While the Old Testament canon varies somewhat between different Christian denominations , the 27-book canon of the New Testament has been almost universally recognized within Christianity since at least Late Antiquity . Thus , in almost all Christian traditions today , the New Testament consists of 27 books : the four canonical gospels ( Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John ) , the Acts of the Apostles , the fourteen epistles of Paul , the seven catholic epistles , and the Book of Revelation . The earliest known complete list of the 27 books of the New Testament is found in a letter written by Athanasius , a 4th-century bishop of Alexandria , dated to 367 AD . The 27-book New Testament was first formally canonized during the councils of Hippo ( 393 ) and Carthage ( 397 ) in North Africa . Pope Innocent I ratified the same canon in 405 , but it is probable that a Council in Rome in 382 under Pope Damasus I gave the same list first . These councils also provided the canon of the Old Testament , which included the apocryphal books . There is no scholarly consensus on the date of composition of the latest New Testament texts .",

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

The term 1960s also refers to an era more often called the Sixties , denoting the complex of inter-related cultural and political trends around the globe . This cultural decade is more loosely defined than the actual decade , beginning around 1963 with the John F. Kennedy assassination and ending around 1974 with the Watergate scandal . The Sixties , as they are known in both scholarship and popular culture , is a term used by historians , journalists , and other academics to describe the counterculture and revolution in social norms about clothing , music , drugs , dress , sexuality , formalities , and schooling ; and in others to denounce the decade as one of irresponsible excess , flamboyance , and decay of social order . The decade was also labeled the Swinging Sixties because of the fall or relaxation of social taboos that occurred during this time , but also because of the emergence of a wide range of music ; from a folk music revival , to the Beatles revolution , to the serious lyrics of Bob Dylan and Paul Simon . Norms of all kinds were broken down , especially in regards to civil rights and expectations the men would go off to meaningless wars . Commentator Christopher Booker described this era as a classical Jungian nightmare cycle , where a rigid culture , unable to contain the demands for greater individual freedom , broke free of the social constraints of the previous age through extreme deviation from the norm . He charts the rise , success , fall/nightmare and explosion in the London scene of the 1960s . Several Western nations such as the United States , United Kingdom , France , and West Germany turned to the political left in the early and mid-1960s . By the end of the 1950s , war-ravaged Europe had largely finished reconstruction and began a tremendous economic boom . World War II had brought about a huge leveling of social classes in which the remnants of the old feudal gentry disappeared . There was a major expansion of the middle class in western European countries and by the 1960s , many working-class people in Western Europe could afford a radio , television , refrigerator , and motor vehicle .",

Generally , a full-time , four-year course of study at a liberal arts college leads students to earning Bachelor of Arts ( B.A . ) , Bachelor of Science ( B.S . ) and on rare occasion Bachelor of Science in Engineering ( B.S.E . ) degrees . These schools are American institutions of higher education which have traditionally emphasized interactive instruction ( although research is still a component of these institutions ) at the undergraduate level . While there is no nationwide legal standard in the United States , the term university is primarily used to designate graduate education and research institutions , and is reserved for doctorate-granting institutions , and some US states , such as Massachusetts , will only grant a school university status if it offers graduate programs in multiple disciplines . These colleges also encourage a high level of student-teacher interaction at the center of which are classes taught by full-time faculty rather than graduate student TAs ( who teach some of the classes at Research I and other universities ) . They are known for being residential and for having smaller enrollment , class size and student-teacher ratios than universities , but have been exploring the recent trend of online learning as a blended or exclusive environment to offer certain courses . Due in part to the increasing tendency of students to seek degrees in medicine , commerce or STEM subjects , liberal arts colleges have decided to explore the idea of creating the traditional environment using online technology , and some liberal arts colleges are now offering entire degree programs online .",
