[ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) . France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Other major urban areas include Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Lille and Nice . France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia . West Francia , which became the Kingdom of France in 987 , emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , following its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) .",
  "/wiki/Europe": "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere . It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , and Asia to the east . The eastern border comprises a long and mixed line of mountain ranges and waterways that would normally define a subcontinent . However , Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition . It is the 6th largest continent in the world . Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres ( 3,930,000 sq mi ) , or 2% of the Earth 's surface ( 6.8% of land area ) . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population . Europe had a total population of about 741 million ( about 11% of the world population ) as of 2018 [ update ] . The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast . Europe , in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome , was the birthplace of Western civilisation .",
  "/wiki/Passage_grave": "A passage grave or passage tomb consists one or more burial chambers covered in earth or with stone , and having a narrow access passage made of large stones . These structures usually date from the Neolithic Age , and are found largely in Western Europe . When covered in earth , a passage grave is a one kind of burial mound which are found in various forms all over the world . When a passage grave is covered in stone , it is a type of cairn . The building of passage graves was normally carried out with megaliths along with smaller stones . The earliest passage tombs seem to take the form of small dolmens , although not all dolmens are passage graves . The passage itself , in a number of notable instances , is aligned in such a way that the sun shines through the passage , into the chamber , at a significant point in the year , often at sunrise on the winter solstice or at sunset on the equinox . Many later passage tombs were constructed at the tops of hills or mountains , indicating that their builders intended them to be seen from a great distance . The interior of passage graves varies in number of burials , shape , and other aspects . Those with more than one chamber may have multiple sub-chambers leading off from the main burial chamber . One common interior layout , the cruciform passage grave , is cross-shaped , although prior to the Christian Era and thus having no Christian associations . Some passage tombs are covered with a cairn , especially those dating from later times .",

  "/wiki/Tumulus": "A tumulus ( plural tumuli ) is a mound of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves . Tumuli are also known as barrows , burial mounds or kurgans , and may be found throughout much of the world . A cairn , which is a mound of stones built for various purposes , may also originally have been a tumulus . Tumuli are often categorised according to their external apparent shape . In this respect , a long barrow is a long tumulus , usually constructed on top of several burials , such as passage graves . A round barrow is a round tumulus , also commonly constructed on top of burials . The internal structure and architecture of both long and round barrows has a broad range ; the categorization only refers to the external apparent shape . The method of inhumation may involve a dolmen , a cist , a mortuary enclosure , a mortuary house , or a chamber tomb . Examples of barrows include Duggleby Howe and Maeshowe . The word tumulus is Latin for 'mound ' or 'small hill ' , which is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *teuh2- with extended zero grade *tum- , 'to bulge , swell ' also found in tomb , tumor , tumescent , thumb , thigh , and thousand .",

  "/wiki/Uruk": "Uruk was an ancient city of Sumer ( and later of Babylonia ) , situated east of the present bed of the Euphrates river , on the dried-up , ancient channel of the Euphrates , some 30 km ( 19 mi ) east of modern Samawah , Al-Muthann\u0101 , Iraq . Uruk is the type site for the Uruk period . Uruk played a leading role in the early urbanization of Sumer in the mid-4th millennium BC . At its height c. 2900 BC , Uruk probably had 50,000-80,000 residents living in 6 km2 ( 2.32 sq mi ) of walled area ; making it the largest city in the world at the time . The legendary king Gilgamesh , according to the chronology presented in the Sumerian king list , ruled Uruk in the 27th century BC . The city lost its prime importance around 2000 BC , in the context of the struggle of Babylonia against Elam , but it remained inhabited throughout the Seleucid ( 312-63 BC ) and Parthian ( 227 BC to 224 AD ) periods until it was finally abandoned shortly before or after the Islamic conquest of 633-638 . William Kennett Loftus visited the site of Uruk in 1849 and led the first excavations from 1850 to 1854 ; he had identified it as Erech , known as the second city of Nimrod . The Arabic name of Babylonia , which eventually became the name of the present-day country , al-\u02bfIr\u0101q , is thought to derive from the name Uruk , via Aramaic ( Erech ) and possibly via Middle Persian ( Er\u0101q ) transmission .

It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity . The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East-West cultural , linguistic , and ethnic differences , some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line .

  "/wiki/Monte_d'Accoddi": "The site was discovered in 1954 in a field owned by the Segni family . The original structure was built by the Ozieri culture or earlier c. 4,000-3,650 BC and has a base of 27 m by 27 m and probably reached a height of 5.5 m. It culminated in a platform of about 12.5 m by 7.2 m , accessible via a ramp . No chambers or entrances to the mound have been found , leading to the presumption it was an altar , a temple or a step pyramid . It may have also served an observational function , as its square plan is coordinated with the cardinal points of the compass . The initial Ozieri structure was abandoned or destroyed around 3000 BC , with traces of fire found in the archeological evidence . Around 2800 BC the remains of the original structure were completely covered with a layered mixture of earth and stone , and large blocks of limestone were then applied to establish a second platform , truncated by a step pyramid ( 36 m \u00d7 29 m , about 10 m in height ) , accessible by means of a second ramp , 42 m long , built over the older one . This second temple resembles contemporary Mesopotamian ziggurats , and is attributed to the Abealzu-Filigosa culture . Archeological excavations from the chalcolithic Abealzu-Filigosa layers indicate the Monte d'Accoddi was used for animal sacrifice , with the remains of sheep , cattle , and swine recovered in near equal proportions . It is among the earliest known sacrificial sites in Western Europe , providing insight into the development of ritual in prehistoric society , and earning it a designation as the most singular cultic monument in the early Western Mediterranean . The site appears to have been abandoned again around 1800 BC , at the onset of the Nuragic age . Based on the evidence of architecture , ritual deposits and diagnostic pottery , G. and M. Webster have recently argued for the monument 's status as a foreign implant , specifically the product of a migration event ( probably exilic ) initiated from Mesopotamia , sometime during the first half of the 4th millennium B.C.E . < ref=G. & M.

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

It is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea after Sicily , and is located west of the Italian Peninsula , north of Tunisia , and to the immediate south of the French island of Corsica . The region of Sardinia is one of the five in Italy that enjoy some degree of domestic autonomy , granted by a specific Statute . Its official name is Regione Autonoma della Sardegna ( Sardinian : Regione Aut\u00f2noma de Sardigna , lit . Autonomous Region of Sardinia ) . It is divided into four provinces and a metropolitan city , with Cagliari being the region 's capital and also its largest city . Sardinia 's indigenous language and the other minority languages ( Sassarese , Gallurese , Algherese Catalan and Ligurian Tabarchino ) spoken on the island are recognized by the regional law and enjoy equal dignity with Italian . Sardinia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic . The island 's most iconic civilization is the indigenous Nuragic one , which lasted from the 18th century BC to either 238 BC or the 2nd century AD in some areas and to the 6th century AD in the region known as Barbagia . After a period under a political and economic alliance between the Nuragic Sardinians and the Phoenicians , the island was partly conquered by Carthage and Rome , in the late 6th century BC and in 238 BC respectively ; the Roman occupation lasted for 700 years , followed in the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals and the Byzantines . Since the island was finding itself disconnected from Byzantium 's scope of territorial influence , the Sardinians provided themselves with a self-ruling political organization , leading to the birth of the four Judicates . As the Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa struggled to exercise increasing political interference upon the indigenous states , the Crown of Aragon subsumed the island as the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1324 .",

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England .

With the child hanging from her shoulder , she built these temples and used them as places of worship .",
  "/wiki/Malta": "The origin of the name Malta is uncertain , and the modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language . The most common etymology is that the word Malta is derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9 , meli , honey . The ancient Greeks called the island \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 ( Melit\u0113 ) meaning honey-sweet , possibly for Malta 's unique production of honey ; an endemic subspecies of bees live on the island . The Romans called the island Melita , which can be considered either a latinisation of the Greek \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b1 . In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration Melite in Acts 28:1 for \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f21 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 as found in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin .

It is rich in historic locations such as the \u0120gantija temples , which , along with the other Megalithic Temples of Malta , are among the world 's oldest free-standing structures . The island is rural in character and , compared to the main island Malta , less developed . Gozo is known for its scenic hills , which are featured on its coat of arms , The Azure Window , a natural limestone arch , was a remarkable geological feature until its collapse on March 8 , 2017 . The island has other notable natural features , including the Inland Sea and Wied il-Miela\u0127 Window . There are many beaches on the island , as well as seaside resorts that are popular with both locals and tourists , the most popular being Marsalforn and Xlendi . Gozo is considered one of the top diving destinations in the Mediterranean and a centre for water sports .",

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . Its territory also includes two archipelagoes : the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea . The African enclaves of Ceuta , Melilla , and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have a physical border with an African country ( Morocco ) . [ h ] Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory . The country 's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population ( about 47 million ) , Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union . Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Zaragoza , M\u00e1laga and Bilbao . Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",
  "/wiki/Megalith": "A megalith is a large stone that has been used to construct a structure or monument , either alone or together with other stones . The adjective megalithic describes structures made of such large stones without the use of mortar [ citation needed ] or concrete , as well as the periods of prehistory characterised by such constructions . There are over 35,000 megaliths in Europe alone , ranging from Sweden to the Mediterranean sea The word was first used in 1849 by the British antiquarian Algernon Herbert in reference to Stonehenge and derives from the Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 ( transliteration m\u00e9gas , meaning great ) and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ( transliteration l\u00edthos meaning stone ) .

  "/wiki/Long_barrow": "Long barrows , also known as chambered tombs , are a style of monument constructed across Western Europe in the fifth and fourth millennia BC , during the Early Neolithic period . Typically constructed from earth and either timber or stone , those using the latter material represent the oldest widespread tradition of stone construction in the world . The structures have an earthen tumulus , or barrow , sometimes with a timber or stone chamber in one end . These monuments often contained human remains interred within their chambers , and as a result , are often interpreted as tombs , although there are some examples where this appears not to be the case . The choice of timber or stone may have arisen from the availability of local materials rather than cultural differences . The earliest examples developed in Iberia and western France during the mid-fifth millennium BC . The tradition then spread northwards , into the British Isles and then the Low Countries and southern Scandinavia . Each area developed its own variations of the long barrow tradition , often exhibiting their own architectural innovations .",

Most date from the early Neolithic ( 4000-3000 BC ) and were sometimes covered with earth or smaller stones to form a tumulus . Small pad-stones may be wedged between the cap and supporting stones to achieve a level appearance . In many instances , the covering has weathered away , leaving only the stone skeleton of the mound intact . It remains unclear when , why and by whom the earliest dolmens were made . The oldest known are found in Western Europe , dating from c 7,000 years ago . Archaeologists still do not know who erected these dolmens , which makes it difficult to know why they did it . They are generally all regarded as tombs or burial chambers , despite the absence of clear evidence for this . Human remains , sometimes accompanied by artefacts , have been found in or close to the dolmens which could be scientifically dated using radiocarbon dating . However , it has been impossible to prove that these remains date from the time when the stones were originally set in place .",
  "/wiki/West_Kennet_Long_Barrow": "The West Kennet Long Barrow , also known as South Long Barrow , is a chambered long barrow located near the village of Avebury in the south-western English county of Wiltshire .

Archaeologists have established that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe . Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe , the West Kennet Long Barrow belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows in Western Britain , now known as the Cotswold-Severn Group . Of these , it is part of a cluster of around thirty centring around Avebury in the uplands of northern Wiltshire . Built out of earth , local sarsen megaliths , and oolitic limestone imported from the Cotswolds , the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones . Its precise date of construction is not known . Human bones were placed within the chamber , probably between 3670 and 3635 BCE , representing a mixture of men , women , children and adults . There is then an apparent hiatus in the use of the site as a place of burial , probably lasting over a century . Between 3620 and 3240 BCE it likely began to be re-used as a burial space , receiving both human and animal remains over a period of several centuries . Various flint tools and ceramic sherds were also placed within it during this time . In the Late Neolithic , the entrance to the long barrow was blocked up with the addition of large sarsen boulders .",

The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation .

Although more recent excavations in Orkney have found Unstan ware to be a more common feature in a domestic context than previously thought , challenging the interpretation of Unstan ware being mainly from tombs . and in the Western Isles , as at Eilean Domhnuill . Unstan ware may have evolved into the later grooved ware style .",
  "/wiki/Megalithic": "A megalith is a large stone that has been used to construct a structure or monument , either alone or together with other stones . The adjective megalithic describes structures made of such large stones without the use of mortar [ citation needed ] or concrete , as well as the periods of prehistory characterised by such constructions . There are over 35,000 megaliths in Europe alone , ranging from Sweden to the Mediterranean sea The word was first used in 1849 by the British antiquarian Algernon Herbert in reference to Stonehenge and derives from the Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 ( transliteration m\u00e9gas , meaning great ) and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ( transliteration l\u00edthos meaning stone ) . Most known megaliths were erected between the Neolithic period ( although earlier Mesolithic examples are known ) through the Chalcolithic period and into the Bronze Age ."
