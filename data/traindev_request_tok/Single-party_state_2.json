At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power .",

Its logo consists of the Six Arrows , which represent the foundational principles of Kemalism : republicanism , nationalism , statism , populism , laicism , and reformism . The political party was established during the Sivas Congress in 1919 as a union of resistance groups against the Greek invasion of Anatolia . The union represented Turkish people as a unified front during the Turkish War of Independence ( 1919-1923 ) . On 9 September 1923 , the People 's Party declared itself to be a political organization and on 29 October 1923 , announced the establishment of the Turkish Republic . On 10 November 1924 , the People 's Party renamed itself the Republican People 's Party ( CHP ) as Turkey moved into a one-party period . During the one-party period , the CHP became the major political organisation of a one-party state . However , CHP faced two opposition parties during this period , both established upon the request of CHP leader and founder of Turkey , Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk , in efforts to kick-start a multi-party democracy in Turkey . The first one was the Progressive Republican Party established in 1924 by famous generals such as Kaz\u0131m Karabekir and Ali Fuat Cebesoy , who both served during the Turkish War of Independence , and the second was the Liberal Republican Party founded by Ali Fethi Okyar in 1930 .",

  "/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912\u20131949)": "The Republic of China ( ROC ) was a sovereign state in mainland China between 1912 and 1949 , prior to the nationalist government 's relocation to the island of Taiwan . It was established in January 1912 after the Xinhai Revolution , which overthrew the Qing dynasty , the last imperial dynasty of China . The Republic 's first president , Sun Yat-sen , served only briefly before handing over the position to Yuan Shikai , the leader of the Beiyang Army . Sun 's party , the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , then led by Song Jiaoren , won the parliamentary election held in December 1912 . However , Song was assassinated on Yuan 's orders shortly after ; and the Beiyang Army , led by Yuan , maintained full control of the Beiyang government . Between late 1915 and early 1916 , Yuan proclaimed himself Emperor of China before abdicating not long after due to popular unrest . After Yuan 's death in 1916 , the authority of the Beiyang government was further weakened by a brief restoration of the Qing dynasty . Cliques in the Beiyang Army claimed individual autonomy and clashed with each other during the ensuing Warlord Era . In 1921 , the KMT established a rival government in Canton , supported by the fledgling Communist Party of China ( CPC ) . The economy of northern China , overtaxed to support warlord adventurism , collapsed between 1927 and 1928 . General Chiang Kai-shek , who became the KMT leader after Sun 's death , started the Northern Expedition in 1926 to overthrow the Beiyang government , which was accomplished in 1928 . In April 1927 , Chiang established a nationalist government in Nanking , and massacred Communists in Shanghai .",

The predecessor of the Kuomintang , the Revolutionary Alliance ( Tongmenghui ) , was one of the major advocates of the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the subsequent revolt in 1911 and proclamation of the Republic of China . The KMT was founded by Song Jiaoren and Sun Yat-sen shortly after the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 . Sun was the provisional President , but he later ceded the presidency to Yuan Shikai . Later led by Chiang Kai-shek , the KMT formed the National Revolutionary Army and succeeded in its Northern Expedition to unify much of mainland China in 1928 , ending the chaos of the Warlord Era . It was the ruling party in mainland China until 1949 , when it lost the Chinese Civil War to the rival Communist Party of China . The KMT fled to Taiwan where it continued to govern as an authoritarian one-party state . This government retained China 's United Nations seat ( with considerable Western support ) until 1971 . Taiwan ceased to be a single-party state in 1986 and political reforms beginning in the 1990s loosened the KMT 's grip on power . Nevertheless , the KMT remains one of Taiwan 's main political parties , with Ma Ying-jeou , elected in 2008 and re-elected in 2012 , being the seventh KMT member to hold the office of the presidency .

Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 .

More specifically , the Burmese Way to Socialism is an economic treatise written in April 1962 by the Revolutionary Council , shortly after the coup , as a blueprint for economic development , reducing foreign influence in Burma and increasing the role of the military . The military coup led by Ne Win and the Revolutionary Council in 1962 was done under the pretext of economic , religious and political crises in the country , particularly the issue of federalism and the right of Burmese states to secede from the Union . The Burmese Way to Socialism has largely been described by scholars as being xenophobic , superstitious and an abject failure and as turning one of the most prosperous countries in Asia into one of the world 's poorest . However , real per capita GDP ( constant 2000 US $ ) in Burma increased from $ 159.18 in 1962 to $ 219.20 in 1987 , or about 1.3% per year - one of the weakest growth rates in East Asia over this period , but still positive . The program also may have served to increase domestic stability and keep Burma from being as entangled in the Cold War struggles that affected other Southeast Asian nations . The Burmese Way to Socialism greatly increased poverty and isolation and has been described as disastrous . Ne Win 's later attempt to make the currency based in denominations divisible by 9 , a number he considered auspicious , wiped out the savings of millions of Burmese . This resulted in the pro-democracy 8888 Uprising , which was violently halted by the military , which established the State Law and Order Restoration Council in 1988 .",

It forms part of the Macaronesia ecoregion , along with the Azores , Canary Islands , Madeira , and the Savage Isles . Located 570 kilometres ( 350 mi ) west of the Cape Verde Peninsula off the coast of Northwest Africa , the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000 square kilometres ( 1,500 sq mi ) . The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century , when Portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the islands , establishing the first European settlement in the tropics . Ideally located for the Atlantic slave trade , the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries , attracting merchants , privateers , and pirates . The end of transatlantic slavery in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration . Cape Verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes . Incorporated as an overseas department of Portugal in 1951 , the islands continued to campaign for independence , which was achieved in 1975 . Since the early 1990s , Cape Verde has been a stable representative democracy , and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa . Lacking natural resources , its developing economy is mostly service-oriented , with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment . Its population of around 540,000 is mostly of mixed European , Moorish , Arab and African heritage , and predominantly Roman Catholic , reflecting the legacy of Portuguese rule . A sizeable diaspora community exists across the world , slightly outnumbering inhabitants on the islands .",

Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism .
