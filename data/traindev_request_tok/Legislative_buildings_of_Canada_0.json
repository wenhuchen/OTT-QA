The city was named after the White Horse Rapids for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse , near Miles Canyon , before the river was dammed . Because of the city 's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the Pacific Ocean , the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as Yellowknife . At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight . Whitehorse , as reported by Guinness World Records , is the city with the least air pollution in the world . As of the 2016 census , the population was 25,085 . This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory ."
