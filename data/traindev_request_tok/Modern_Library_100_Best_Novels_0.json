  "/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)": "Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce . It was first serialised in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922 , Joyce 's 40th birthday . It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called a demonstration and summation of the entire movement . According to Declan Kiberd , Before Joyce , no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking . Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day , 16 June 1904 . Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus , the hero of Homer 's epic poem the Odyssey , and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel , with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Leopold Bloom and Odysseus , Molly Bloom and Penelope , and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus , in addition to events and themes of the early 20th-century context of modernism , Dublin , and Ireland 's relationship to Britain . The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature . Since its publication , the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny , ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 , to protracted textual Joyce Wars . The novel 's stream-of-consciousness technique , careful structuring , and experimental prose - replete with puns , parodies , and allusions - as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour , have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history ; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday .",
  "/wiki/James_Joyce": "James Augustine Aloysius Joyce ( 2 February 1882 - 13 January 1941 ) was an Irish novelist , short story writer , poet , teacher , and literary critic . He contributed to the modernist avant-garde and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the 20th century . Joyce is best known for Ulysses ( 1922 ) , a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer 's Odyssey are paralleled in a variety of literary styles , most famously stream of consciousness . Other well-known works are the short-story collection Dubliners ( 1914 ) , and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man ( 1916 ) and Finnegans Wake ( 1939 ) . His other writings include three books of poetry , a play , his published letters and occasional journalism . Joyce was born in Dublin into a middle-class family . A brilliant student , he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run O'Connell School before excelling at the Jesuit schools Clongowes and Belvedere , despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father 's unpredictable finances . He went on to attend University College Dublin . In 1904 , in his early twenties , Joyce emigrated to continental Europe with his partner ( and later wife ) Nora Barnacle . They lived in Trieste , Paris , and Z\u00fcrich . Although most of his adult life was spent abroad , Joyce 's fictional universe centres on Dublin and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members , enemies and friends from his time there . Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city .",
  "/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby": "The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional towns of West Egg and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922 . The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession with the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan . Considered to be Fitzgerald 's magnum opus , The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence , idealism , resistance to change , social upheaval and excess , creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary [ a ] tale regarding the American Dream . Fitzgerald - inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island 's North Shore - began planning the novel in 1923 , desiring to produce , in his words , something new - something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned . Progress was slow , with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924 . His editor , Maxwell Perkins , felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter . Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book 's title and he considered a variety of alternatives , including titles that referred to the Roman character Trimalchio ; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red , White , and Blue . First published by Scribner 's in April 1925 , The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly . In its first year , the book sold only 20,000 copies . Fitzgerald died in 1940 , believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten . However , the novel experienced a revival during World War II , and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades . Today , The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title of the Great American Novel .",
  "/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald": "Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald ( September 24 , 1896 - December 21 , 1940 ) was an American writer . His novels depicted the flamboyance and excess of the Jazz Age . Though he achieved popular success , fame , and fortune in his lifetime , Fitzgerald did not receive much critical acclaim until after his death . Considered a member of the Lost Generation of the 1920s , today he is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century . He finished four novels : This Side of Paradise , The Beautiful and Damned , The Great Gatsby , and Tender Is the Night . The unfinished novel The Last Tycoon was published posthumously . Four collections of his short stories were published , as well as 164 short stories in magazines during his lifetime .",
  "/wiki/A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man": "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is the first novel of Irish writer James Joyce . A K\u00fcnstlerroman in a modernist style , it traces the religious and intellectual awakening of young Stephen Dedalus , a fictional alter ego of Joyce and an allusion to Daedalus , the consummate craftsman of Greek mythology . Stephen questions and rebels against the Catholic and Irish conventions under which he has grown , culminating in his self-exile from Ireland to Europe . The work uses techniques that Joyce developed more fully in Ulysses ( 1922 ) and Finnegans Wake ( 1939 ) . A Portrait began life in 1904 as Stephen Hero - a projected 63-chapter autobiographical novel in a realistic style . After 25 chapters , Joyce abandoned Stephen Hero in 1907 and set to reworking its themes and protagonist into a condensed five-chapter novel , dispensing with strict realism and making extensive use of free indirect speech that allows the reader to peer into Stephen 's developing consciousness . American modernist poet Ezra Pound had the novel serialised in the English literary magazine The Egoist in 1914 and 1915 , and published as a book in 1916 by B. W. Huebsch of New York . The publication of A Portrait and the short story collection Dubliners ( 1914 ) earned Joyce a place at the forefront of literary modernism .",

Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century , it uses a distinctive non-chronological third-person omniscient narration , describing events from the points of view of different characters . The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline develops along with the plot . The novel is set during World War II , from 1942 to 1944 . It mainly follows the life of antihero Captain John Yossarian , a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier .
