Some early skyscrapers have a steel frame that enables the construction of load-bearing walls taller than of those made of reinforced concrete . Modern skyscrapers ' walls are not load-bearing , and most skyscrapers are characterised by large surface areas of windows made possible by steel frames and curtain walls .

  "/wiki/City_of_London": "The City of London is a city , county and a local government district [ note 1 ] that contains the historic centre and the primary central business district ( CBD ) of London . It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages , but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City 's borders . The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London , though it remains a notable part of central London . Administratively , it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London ; however , the City of London is not a London borough , a status reserved for the other 32 districts ( including London 's only other city , the City of Westminster ) . It is also a separate ceremonial county , being an enclave surrounded by Greater London , and is the smallest county in the United Kingdom . The City of London is widely referred to simply as the City ( differentiated from the phrase the city of London by capitalising City ) and is also colloquially known as the Square Mile , as it is 1.12 sq mi ( 716.80 acres ; 2.90 km2 ) in area . Both of these terms are also often used as metonyms for the United Kingdom 's trading and financial services industries , which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City . The name London is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City . London most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis , or the 32 London boroughs , in addition to the City of London itself . This wider usage of London is documented as far back as 1888 , when the County of London was created . The local authority for the City , namely the City of London Corporation , is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council , such as being the police authority . It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries .",

Located in the northeast of the island of Ireland , Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland . In 2011 , its population was 1,810,863 , constituting about 30% of the island 's total population and about 3% of the UK 's population . Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement , the Northern Ireland Assembly ( colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location ) holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters , while other areas are reserved for the British government . Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas , and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to put forward views and proposals with determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments . On 11 January 2020 , legislators in Northern Ireland formed a government for the first time since the Executive of the 5th Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January 2017 , following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal . Northern Ireland was created in 1921 , when Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 . Unlike Southern Ireland , which would become the Irish Free State in 1922 , the majority of Northern Ireland 's population were unionists , who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom . Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain . However , a significant minority , mostly Catholics , were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule . Today , the former generally see themselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish , while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by many of those who are non-aligned . For most of the 20th century , when it came into existence , Northern Ireland was marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland , David Trimble , called a cold house for Catholics .",
  "/wiki/Burnhope_transmitting_station": "The Burnhope transmitting station was originally built by the Independent Television Authority ( ITA ) as its sole 405-line transmitting station service the Tyne Tees Television region . Test transmissions started in December 1958 approximately one month before the launch on Tyne Tees Television on 15 January 1959 . It was built close to the existing BBC Band I station at Pontop Pike . This was the eighth transmitter opened by the ITA . From the station 's 750 foot mast , transmissions from Burnhope were on VHF Channel 8 at a peak vision ERP of 100 kW , successfully covering a region spanning the North Yorkshire moorlands and Teesside in the South , to the remote upper reaches of Northumberland in the North . With the advent of UHF with its 625-lines , the adjacent Pontop Pike transmitting station carried these services to the Newcastle and County Durham area from 1967 onwards , confining Burnhope to 405-line transmission . In due course , further main UHF transmissions were established at Bilsdale West Moor ( serving North Yorkshire and Teesside ) and Chatton ( serving upper Northumberland ) . The transmitter would later get a new lease of life with the advent of Independent Local Radio ( commercial radio or ILR ) . Burnhope extended its remit by providing the transmissions for the first ILR service in the North East of England - Metro Radio on 97.0 MHz ( now on 97.1 MHz ) . After the 405-line television service ceased in January 1985 , Metro Radio was for many years , the only broadcasting duty performed by the transmitter until the early 1990s , when a new tranche of commercial radio ( regional ) became available . On 1 September 1994 , the transmitter started broadcasting the first new regional radio service to the North East . Launched as Century Network , it then broadcast as Real Radio ( North East ) and is now Heart North East .",
