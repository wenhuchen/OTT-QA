In 1887 , a brick-veneered building was built , but it was destroyed by a fire on December 24 , 1899 . $ 30,000 was raised toward the cost of a new church , whose cornerstone was laid on July 4 , 1900 .

  "/wiki/Renaissance_Revival_architecture": "Renaissance Revival architecture ( sometimes referred to as Neo-Renaissance ) is a group of 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Greek Revival nor Gothic Revival but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes . Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism ; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque . Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century : Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate , or when many French Baroque features are present ( Second Empire ) . The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe , particularly in France and Italy , has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture . A comparison between the breadth of its source material , such as the English Wollaton Hall , Italian Palazzo Pitti , the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , and the Russian Palace of Facets - all deemed Renaissance - illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take .",

  "/wiki/Baroque_Revival_architecture": "The Baroque Revival , also known as Neo-Baroque ( or Second Empire architecture in France and Wilhelminism in Germany ) , was an architectural style of the late 19th century . The term is used to describe architecture and architectural sculptures which display important aspects of Baroque style , but are not of the original Baroque period . Elements of the Baroque architectural tradition were an essential part of the curriculum of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris , the pre-eminent school of architecture in the second half of the 19th century , and are integral to the Beaux-Arts architecture it engendered both in France and abroad . An ebullient sense of European imperialism encouraged an official architecture to reflect it in Britain and France , and in Germany and Italy the Baroque Revival expressed pride in the new power of the unified state .",

The first Polish settlers arrived at Walter Raleigh 's failed Roanoke Colony in 1585 . In 1608 Polish settlers came to the Virginia Colony as skilled craftsmen . Two early Polish visitors , Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko , led armies in the Revolutionary War and are remembered as national heroes . Overall , around 2.2 million Poles and Polish subjects immigrated into the United States , between 1820 and 1914 , chiefly after national insurgencies and famine . They included former Polish citizens of Roman Catholic , Protestant , Jewish or other minority descent . Exact immigration figures are unknown . Many immigrants were classified as Russian , German or Austrian by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service as the Polish state did not exist from 1795 to 1918 when the former territories of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were under Prussian , Austrian-Hungarian and Russian control . Complicating the U.S. Census figures further is the high proportion of Polish Americans who married people of other national descent .
