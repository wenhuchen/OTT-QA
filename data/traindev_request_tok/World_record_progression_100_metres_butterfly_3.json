The city is located in the state 's south-east on the estuary of the River Derwent , making it the most southern of Australia 's capital cities . Its skyline is dominated by the 1,271-metre ( 4,170 ft ) Mount Wellington , and its harbour forms the second-deepest natural port in the world , with much of the city 's waterfront consisting of reclaimed land . The metropolitan area is often referred to as Greater Hobart , to differentiate it from the City of Hobart , one of the five local government areas that cover the city . Founded in 1804 as a British penal colony , Hobart is Australia 's second oldest capital city after Sydney , New South Wales . Prior to British settlement , the Hobart area had been occupied for possibly as long as 35,000 years , by the semi-nomadic Mouheneener tribe , a sub-group of the Nuennone , or South-East tribe . The descendants of these Aboriginal Tasmanians often refer to themselves as 'Palawa ' . Since its foundation , the city has expanded from the mouth of Sullivans Cove in a generally north-south direction along both banks of the River Derwent , from 22 km inland from the estuary at Storm Bay to the point where the river reverts to fresh water at Bridgewater . Penal transportation ended in the 1850s , after which the city experienced periods of growth and decline . The early 20th century saw an economic boom on the back of mining , agriculture and other primary industries , and the loss of men who served in the world wars was counteracted by an influx of immigration . Despite the rise in migration from Asia and other non-English speaking regions , Hobart 's population remains predominantly ethnically Anglo-Celtic , and has the highest percentage of Australian-born residents among Australia 's capital cities .",

It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",

  "/wiki/Canberra": "Canberra ( /\u02c8k\u00e6nb\u0259r\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is the capital city of Australia . Founded following the federation of the colonies of Australia as the seat of government for the new nation , it is Australia 's largest inland city and the eighth-largest city overall . The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory ; 280 km ( 170 mi ) south-west of Sydney and 660 km ( 410 mi ) north-east of Melbourne . On 1 January 1901 , federation of the colonies of Australia was achieved . Section 125 of the new Australian Constitution provided that land , situated in New South Wales and at least 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Sydney , would be ceded to the new federal government . Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales , the Seat of Government Act 1908 was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region . The land was transferred to the Commonwealth by New South Wales in 1911 , creating the Australian Capital Territory , two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913 . It is unusual among Australian cities , being an entirely planned city outside of any state , similar to Washington , D.C. in the United States or Bras\u00edlia in Brazil . Following an international contest for the city 's design , a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913 . The Griffins ' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles , hexagons and triangles , and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory . The city 's design was influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation . As the seat of the government of Australia , Canberra is home to many important institutions of the federal government , national monuments and museums .",
