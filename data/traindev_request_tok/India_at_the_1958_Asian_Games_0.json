  "/wiki/Milkha_Singh": "Milkha Singh ( 21 November 1935 ) , [ a ] also known as The Flying Sikh , is an Indian former track and field sprinter who was introduced to the sport while serving in the Indian Army . He was the only Indian athlete to win an individual athletics gold medal at a Commonwealth Games until Krishna Poonia won the discus gold medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games . He also won gold medals in the 1958 and 1962 Asian Games . He represented India in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne , the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo . He was awarded the Padma Shri , India 's fourth-highest civilian honour , in recognition of his sporting achievements . The race for which Singh is best remembered is his fourth-place finish in the 400 metres final at the 1960 Olympic Games , which he had entered as one of the favourites . He led the race till the 200m mark before easing off , allowing others to pass him . Various records were broken in the race , which required a photo-finish and saw American Otis Davis being declared the winner by one-hundredth of a second over German Carl Kaufmann . Singh 's fourth-place time of 45.73 became the Indian national record and held for almost 40 years From beginnings that saw him orphaned and displaced during the Partition of India , Singh has become a sporting icon in his country . In 2008 , journalist Rohit Brijnath described Singh as the finest athlete India has ever produced . In July 2012 , The Independent said that India 's most revered Olympian is a gallant loser and noted the paucity of success at that time - 20 medals - achieved by Indian competitors in the Olympic Games despite the country having a population in excess of one billion .",
