  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/Windy_Point_Wind_Farm": "The Windy Point/Windy Flats project , located in Goldendale , Washington , is the largest wind farm Washington State . The 90 square miles ( 230 km2 ) wind farm spans 26 miles ( 42 km ) along the Columbia River ridgeline offering upon completion a capacity of 500 megawatts ( MW ) . Construction of 400 of the 500 MW was completed by the end of 2009 . Cannon Power Group , the project developer , constructed the 400 MW in two phases within 18 months - Phase I ( 137 MW ) and Phase II ( 262 MW ) . A third phase is planned for 2010 . The initial 400 MW represents an investment of over $ 1 billion . California will benefit from the Windy Point/Windy Flats project which could help the state meet its renewable energy goals since two California off-takers [ further explanation needed ] have purchased all 400 MW of power . Additionally , the project has provided more than 350 jobs over the past two years , plus creating many additional permanent administrative and operational positions .",

  "/wiki/Wild_Horse_Wind_Farm": "The Wild Horse Wind Farm is a 273-megawatt wind farm that generates energy for Puget Sound Energy that consists of one hundred twenty seven 1.8-megawatt Vestas V80 turbines and twenty two 2.0-megawatt Vestas V80 turbines on a 10,800-acre ( 4,400 ha ) site in Kittitas County , Washington , 17 miles ( 27 km ) east of Ellensburg , Washington . The turbines are placed on the high open Shrub-steppe ridge tops of Whiskey Dick Mountain , which was chosen for its energetic wind resource , remote location , and access to nearby power transmission lines . The towers are 221 feet ( 67 m ) tall , and each blade is 129 feet ( 39 m ) long , with a total rotor diameter of 264 feet ( 80 m ) , larger than the wingspan of a Boeing 747 . The turbines can begin producing electricity with wind speeds as low as 9 mph ( 14 km/h ) and reach full production at 31 mph ( 50 km/h ) . They shut down at sustained wind speeds of 56 mph ( 90 km/h ) . The site is also home to one of the largest solar array ( 500 kW ) in Washington . The wind farm was developed by Horizon Wind ( formerly owned by Goldman Sachs , later sold to EDP ) EDP Renewables , a subsidiary of Energias de Portugal S.A. ( EDP ) , a Portuguese utility company and built by Puget Sound Energy ( PSE ) , an electric and gas distribution utility in the State of Washington . Construction began in October 2005 and was completed in December 2006 . An expansion was completed in 2009 . The Wild Horse Wind Farm also has a visitor center called the Renewable Energy Center , with guided tours of a Silicon Energy Solar array , a 1.8 MW wind turbine generator , a wind turbine blade , and includes a look inside the base of a wind turbine .",

  "/wiki/Stateline_Wind_Farm": "The Stateline Wind Farm is a wind farm located on Vansycle Ridge , which receives 16 to 18 mph ( 26 - 29 km/h ) average wind speeds from the Columbia Gorge , on the border between Washington and Oregon in the United States . With 186 turbines currently operating in both states and 279 more approved for construction , it is the largest wind project in the Northwestern United States and will be the largest in the world . Costing $ 300 million to build , it began operation in 2001 . The project employs 660 kW capacity Vestas wind turbines , which collectively will produce a maximum electrical output of 306.9 MW . ( The current operating capacity is 122.8 MW . ) On average , the project is expected to produce 30 to 35 percent of that capacity year-round . Turbines are controlled individually by electronic systems which direct them into the wind and adjust the pitch of the blades to maximize electrical production at any wind speed from 7 to 56 mph . The turbines automatically shut down at wind speeds excess of 56 mph , a feature which allows them to withstand hurricane-force winds . The wind turbines are grouped in strings of 5 to 37 turbines , each turbine spaced approximately 250 feet ( 76 m ) from the next , generally slightly downwind of the crest of ridges . Each turbine tower is 166 feet ( 50 m ) tall , with blades 76 feet ( 23 m ) wide . Environmental impact studies determined that the site was not used extensively by birds or other species vulnerable to injury from turbines , and the turbine towers ' construction , along with the use of underground power lines , was designed to minimize perching places for birds . The area around the project is used primarily for private farming , including dryland wheat farming and cattle grazing .",
