Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea , Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean meet . It is east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula ( Mexico ) , south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas , west of Haiti and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands . Havana is the largest city and capital ; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camag\u00fcey . The area of the Republic of Cuba is 110,860 square kilometers ( 42,800 sq mi ) ( 109,884 square kilometers ( 42,426 sq mi ) without the territorial waters ) . The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean , with an area of 105,006 square kilometers ( 40,543 sq mi ) , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola , with over 11 million inhabitants . The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century . From the 15th century , it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898 , when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 . As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro . Since 1965 , the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba . The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .",

The city of Havana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century and due to its strategic location it served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas , becoming a stopping point for treasure-laden Spanish galleons returning to Spain . The King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City in 1592 . Walls as well as forts were built to protect the old city . The sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana 's harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish-American War . The city is the center of the Cuban government , and home to various ministries , headquarters of businesses and over 90 diplomatic offices . The current governor is Reinaldo Garc\u00eda Zapata of the Communist Party of Cuba ( PCC ) . In 2009 , the city/province had the third highest income in the country . Contemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one : Old Havana , Vedado and the newer suburban districts . The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay , which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors : Mari melena , Guanabacoa and Antares . The sluggish Almendares River traverses the city from south to north , entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay .",

Honduras became independent in 1821 and has since been a republic , although it has consistently endured much social strife and political instability , and remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere . In 1960 , the northern part of what was the Mosquito Coast was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the International Court of Justice . The nation 's economy is primarily agricultural , making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch in 1998 . The lower class is primarily agriculturally based while wealth is concentrated in the country 's urban centers . Honduras has a Human Development Index of 0.625 , classifying it as a nation with medium development . When the Index is adjusted for income inequality , its Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index is 0.443 .

Originally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples , the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494 . Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity , and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers . The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655 , when England ( later Great Britain ) conquered it , renaming it Jamaica . Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants . The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838 , and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations . Beginning in the 1840s , the British began utilising Chinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations . The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962 .

As of 2018 [ update ] , the country had a population of approximately 6.42 million .

When the Republic dissolved in 1841 , El Salvador became a sovereign nation , then formed a short-lived union with Honduras and Nicaragua called the Greater Republic of Central America , which lasted from 1895 to 1898 . From the late 19th to the mid-20th century , El Salvador endured chronic political and economic instability characterized by coups , revolts , and a succession of authoritarian rulers . Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest culminated in the devastating Salvadoran Civil War ( 1979-1992 ) , which was fought between the military-led government and a coalition of left-wing guerrilla groups .
