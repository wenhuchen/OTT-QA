  "/wiki/ABC_Africa": "ABC Africa is a 2001 Iranian documentary feature film directed by Abbas Kiarostami . It was screened out of competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival . Invited by the United Nations to study the endeavors of the Uganda Women 's Effort to Save Orphans , Kiarostami and his collaborator Seifollah Samadian initially went to the country to scout locations for a feature-length film . However , when the pair returned home and examined the more than twenty hours of digital footage shot on digital video with a handheld video camera over the course of ten days , they decided their material was worth editing into the feature-length film . For Kiarostami , this film was a return to his early themes of resilient children in the face of adversity , but for the first time it was outside his homeland with a more versatile format . Nevertheless , Irans foremost film-maker has succeeded in locating reasons for optimism among the nearly two million orphans left helpless by the ravages of civil war and AIDS .",

  "/wiki/Short_film": "A short film is any motion picture not long enough in running time to be considered a feature film . The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a short film as an original motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less , including all credits . In the United States , short films were generally termed short subjects from the 1920s into the 1970s when confined to two 35mm reels or less , and featurettes for a film of three or four reels . Short was an abbreviation for either term . The increasingly rare industry term short subject carries more of an assumption that the film is shown as part of a presentation along with a feature film . Short films are often screened at local , national , or international film festivals and made by independent filmmakers with either a low budget or no budget at all . They are usually funded by film grants , nonprofit organizations , sponsor , or personal funds . Short films are generally used for industry experience and as a platform to showcase talent to secure funding for future projects from private investors , a production company , or film studios .",

  "/wiki/Action_film": "Action film is a film genre in which the protagonist or protagonists are thrust into a series of events that typically include violence , extended fighting , physical feats , and frantic chases . Action films tend to feature a resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds , which include life-threatening situations , a villain , or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the hero ( though a small number of films in this genre have ended in the victory for the villain instead ) . Advancements in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past . However , reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed , as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic , highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism . While action has long been a recurring component in films , the action film genre began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and special effects . Common action scenes in films are generally , but not limited to , explosions , car chases , fistfights , and shootouts . This genre is closely associated with the thriller and adventure genres , and they may also contain elements of drama and spy fiction .",

  "/wiki/Drama_film": "In film and television , drama is a genre of narrative fiction ( or semi-fiction ) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone . Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular subgenre , such as police crime drama , political drama , legal drama , historical period drama , domestic drama , teen drama or comedy-drama . These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter , or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods . All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved by means of actors who represent ( mimesis ) characters . In this broader sense , drama is a mode distinct from novels , short stories , and narrative poetry or songs . In the modern era before the birth of cinema or television , drama within theatre was a type of play that was neither a comedy nor a tragedy . It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries , along with film studies , adopted . Radio drama has been used in both senses - originally transmitted in a live performance , it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio .",
