  "/wiki/Modern_History": "The history of the world , in common parlance , is the history of humanity ( or human history ) , as determined from archeology , anthropology , genetics , linguistics , and other disciplines ; and , for periods since the invention of writing , from recorded history and from secondary sources and studies . Humanity 's written history was preceded by its prehistory , beginning with the Palaeolithic Era ( Old Stone Age ) , followed by the Neolithic Era ( New Stone Age ) . The Neolithic saw the Agricultural Revolution begin , between 8000 and 5000 BCE , in the Near East 's Fertile Crescent . During this period , humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals . As agriculture advanced , most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements . The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units , fostered by advances in transportation . Whether in prehistoric or historic times , people always needed to be near reliable sources of potable water . Settlements developed on river banks as early as 3000 BCE in Mesopotamia , on the banks of Egypt 's Nile River , in the Indus River valley , and along China 's rivers . As farming developed , grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons . Labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities , which provided the foundation for civilization . The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing . With civilizations flourishing , ancient history ( Antiquity , including the Classical Age , up to about 500 CE ) saw the rise and fall of empires .",
  "/wiki/Rhodes_Scholars": "The Rhodes Scholarship is an international postgraduate award for students to study at the University of Oxford . It was established in 1902 , making it the first large-scale programme of international scholarship . The Rhodes Scholarship was founded by English businessman and politician Cecil John Rhodes , to promote unity between English-speaking nations and instill a sense of civic-minded leadership and moral fortitude in future leaders irrespective of their chosen career paths . Although initially restricted to male applicants from countries which are today within the British Commonwealth , as well as Germany and the United States , today the scholarship is open to applicants from all backgrounds and from across the globe . Since its creation , controversy has surrounded both its former exclusion of women ( thus leading to the establishment of the co-educational Marshall Scholarship ) , and Rhodes ' white supremacist beliefs and legacy of colonialism . Prominent recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship include politicians , academics , scientists , authors and entrepreneurs . Notable American politicians include former president of the United States Bill Clinton , former United States national security advisor and United States ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice , former governor of Louisiana Piyush Bobby Jindal , former United States secretary of the Air Force and former congresswoman Heather Wilson , and former United States secretary of health and human services Sylvia Matthews Burwell . President of Pakistan Wasim Sajjad ; former prime minister of Malta Dom Mintoff ; former Australian prime ministers Tony Abbott , Bob Hawke and Malcolm Turnbull ; and the current deputy prime minister of Canada , Chrystia Freeland are also Rhodes Scholars . Other notable Rhodes Scholars include journalist and American television host Rachel Maddow , author Naomi Wolf , former 2020 presidential candidate and New Jersey senator Cory Booker , 2020 presidential candidate and former mayor of South Bend Pete Buttigieg , former president of Planned Parenthood Leana Wen , Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrow , and president of the Walmart Foundation Kathleen McLaughlin .

  "/wiki/Barrister": "A barrister is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions . Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation . Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals , drafting legal pleadings , researching the philosophy , hypothesis and history of law , and giving expert legal opinions . Barristers are distinguished from solicitors , who have more direct access to clients , and may do transactional-type legal work . It is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges , and they are rarely hired by clients directly . In some legal systems , including those of Scotland , South Africa , Scandinavia , Pakistan , India , Bangladesh , and the British Crown dependencies of Jersey , Guernsey and the Isle of Man , the word barrister is also regarded as an honorific title . In a few jurisdictions , barristers are usually forbidden from conducting litigation , and can only act on the instructions of a solicitor , who performs tasks such as corresponding with parties and the court , and drafting court documents . In England and Wales , barristers may seek authorisation from the Bar Standards Board to conduct litigation . This allows a barrister to practise in a 'dual capacity ' , fulfilling the role of both barrister and solicitor . In some countries with common law legal systems , such as New Zealand and some regions of Australia , lawyers are entitled to practise both as barristers and solicitors , but it remains a separate system of qualification to practise exclusively as a barrister .",

In addition to the standard periodization , proponents of a long Renaissance put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century . The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past , but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages . The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism , derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy , such as that of Protagoras , who said that Man is the measure of all things . This new thinking became manifest in art , architecture , politics , science and literature . Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete . Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century , the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe : the very first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century , in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto . As a cultural movement , the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures , beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources , which contemporaries credited to Petrarch ; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting ; and gradual but widespread educational reform . In politics , the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy , and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning . Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits , as well as social and political upheaval , it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo , who inspired the term Renaissance man . The Renaissance began in the 14th century in Florence , Italy . Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics , focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time : its political structure , the patronage of its dominant family , the Medici , and the migration of Greek scholars and their texts to Italy following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks .",

Charles was born into the House of Stuart as the second son of King James VI of Scotland , but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603 ( as James I ) , he moved to England , where he spent much of the rest of his life . He became heir apparent to the three kingdoms of England , Scotland and Ireland in 1612 on the death of his elder brother Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales . An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations . Two years later he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France . After his succession in 1625 , Charles quarrelled with the Parliament of England , which sought to curb his royal prerogative . Charles believed in the divine right of kings , and was determined to govern according to his own conscience . Many of his subjects opposed his policies , in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent , and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch . His religious policies , coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic , generated the antipathy and mistrust of Reformed groups such as the English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters , who thought his views were too Catholic . He supported high church Anglican ecclesiastics , such as Richard Montagu and William Laud , and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years ' War . His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops ' Wars , strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments , and helped precipitate his own downfall . From 1642 , Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War .",

  "/wiki/American_History": "The history of the United States , a country in North America , started with the arrival of Native Americans in the United States from before 15,000 B.C . Numerous indigenous cultures formed , and many disappeared before 1500 . The arrival of Christopher Columbus in the year 1492 started the European colonization of the Americas . Most colonies were formed after 1600 , and the early records and writings of John Winthrop make the United States the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded . By the 1760s , the thirteen British colonies contained 2.5 million people along the Atlantic Coast east of the Appalachian Mountains . After defeating France , the British government imposed a series of taxes , including the Stamp Act of 1765 , rejecting the colonists ' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval . Resistance to these taxes , especially the Boston Tea Party in 1773 , led to Parliament issuing punitive laws designed to end self-government in Massachusetts . Armed conflict began in 1775 . In 1776 in Philadelphia , the Second Continental Congress declared the independence of the colonies as the United States . Led by General George Washington , it won the Revolutionary War with large support from France . The peace treaty of 1783 gave the land east of the Mississippi River ( except Canada and Florida ) to the new nation . The Articles of Confederation established a central government , but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer .",
