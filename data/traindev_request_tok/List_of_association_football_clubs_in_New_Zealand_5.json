  "/wiki/Caversham,_New_Zealand": "Caversham /\u02c8k\u00e6v\u0259r\u0283\u0259m/ is one of the older suburbs of the city of Dunedin , in New Zealand 's South Island . It is sited at the western edge of the city 's central plain at the mouth of the steep Caversham Valley , which rises to the saddle of Lookout Point . Major road and rail routes south lie nearby ; the South Island Main Trunk railway runs through the suburb , and a bypass skirts its main retail area , connecting Dunedin 's one-way street system with the Dunedin Southern Motorway . The suburb is linked by several bus routes to its neighbouring suburbs and central Dunedin . The suburb was founded by wealthy pioneer William Henry Valpy , and its name reflects his family connections with the town of Reading , in the English county of Berkshire . Caversham grew rapidly during the Central Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s because of its location on routes south to the Otago hinterland . By the end of the 19th century , Caversham was heavily industrialised , and its population included many skilled or semi-skilled tradespeople . This , combined with the community 's strong Protestant roots , led to the area 's generally left-leaning political stance . Caversham 's early history has been the subject of the Caversham Project , a major historical and archaeological study by the University of Otago . Caversham was a separate borough until 1904 , when it was amalgamated with Dunedin city . It is currently administered as part of the city 's South Dunedin ward . At a national level , it is part of the Dunedin South electorate .",

The suburb takes its name from the similarly named town in Scotland . Musselburgh 's 2001 population was 2,835 .

The Rise is located close to the southernmost point of the Otago Harbour immediately to the west of the Andersons Bay Inlet . Another outcrop , geologically part of the same formation , lies several hundred metres to the east , and has been extensively quarried . The rise lends its name to the suburb 's main street , Musselburgh Rise ( differentiated in name from the outcrop by always being written without the definite article ) , which connects with the southern end of Andersons Bay Road and skirts the southern flank of the outcrop . Musselburgh Rise contains the suburb 's small retail area , consisting of some dozen or so shops .
