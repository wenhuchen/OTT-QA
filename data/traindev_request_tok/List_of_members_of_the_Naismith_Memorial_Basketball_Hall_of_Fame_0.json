  "/wiki/Helms_Athletic_Foundation": "Founded in 1936 by Bill Schroeder and Paul Helms , the Helms Athletic Foundation was based in Los Angeles , California . The name was a misnomer , as there actually was no foundation in place to sustain the operation . Instead the organization was subsidized completely by the Paul Helms Bakery operations . Schroeder selected the foundation 's national champion teams and made All-America team selections in a number of college sports , including football and basketball . He continued to select national champions for the Helms Foundation until 1982 , its final year of selections . Schroeder also retroactively selected national champions in college football dating from 1947 back to the 1883 season and in college basketball from 1942 back to the 1900-01 season . The Helms Foundation also operated a hall of fame for both college sports . The retroactive Helms titles were the well-researched opinions of one person about teams that played during an era when , due to factors outside their control ( e.g. , minimal schedules , lack of intersectional play , differing rule interpretations , minimal statistics ) , it is difficult to know or assess the relative strength of the teams . Besides collegiate athletics , the foundation operated halls of fame for professional football , Major League Baseball , the Pacific Coast League , basketball , fencing , golf , tennis , swimming , auto racing , track and fieldand soaring . After Paul Helms ' death in 1957 , United Savings and Loan became the Helms Foundation 's benefactor and when United merged with Citizen Savings Bank in 1973 , the Athletic Foundation became known as the Citizens Savings Athletic Foundation . It was again renamed in 1982 when First Interstate Bank assumed sponsorship for the foundation 's final year . Paul Helms started Helms Bakery in Southern California , which was the official bread ( Helms Olympic bread ) of the 1932 Olympics .",
