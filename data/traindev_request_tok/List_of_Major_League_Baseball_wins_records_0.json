  "/wiki/Jack_Chesbro": "John Dwight Chesbro ( June 5 , 1874 - November 6 , 1931 ) was an American Major League Baseball ( MLB ) pitcher . Nicknamed Happy Jack , Chesbro played for the Pittsburgh Pirates ( 1899-1902 ) , the New York Highlanders ( 1903-1909 ) , and the Boston Red Sox ( 1909 ) . Chesbro finished his career with a 198-132 win-loss record , a 2.68 earned run average , and 1,265 strikeouts . His 41 wins during the 1904 season remains an American League record . Though some pitchers have won more games in some seasons prior to 1901 , historians demarcating 1901 as the beginning of 'modern-era ' major league baseball refer to and credit Jack Chesbro and his 1904 win-total as the modern era major league record and its holder . Some view Chesbro 's 41 wins in a season as an unbreakable record . Chesbro 's 1904 pitching totals of 51 games started and 48 complete games also fall into the same historical category as his 1904 wins total , as they are all-time American League single-season records . These 1904 single-season totals for games started and complete games , like the wins total , are also the most recorded by a pitcher in either the American or National League since the beginning of the twentieth century and the co-existence of the American and National Leagues as major leagues . If one demarcates 1901 as the beginning of major league baseball 's modern era , Jack Chesbro holds the modern era major league historical single-season records for wins by a pitcher ( 41 ) , games started by a pitcher ( 51 ) , and complete games pitched ( 48 ) . Chesbro was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 by the Veterans Committee , though he had received little consideration from the Baseball Writers ' Association of America ( BBWAA ) . Some baseball historians consider the 1946 election a mistake , and believe that Chesbro was elected solely on the basis of his 1904 season .",

In 1936 , Johnson was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its first five inaugural members .
