  "/wiki/Flood": "A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry . In the sense of flowing water , the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide . Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture , civil engineering and public health . Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies , such as a river , lake , or ocean , in which the water overtops or breaks levees , resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries , or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood . While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt , these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals . Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel , particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway . Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers . While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water , people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry . Some floods develop slowly , while others can develop in just a few minutes and without visible signs of rain . Additionally , floods can be local , impacting a neighborhood or community , or very large , affecting entire river basins .",

Although Broome was a small pearling port at the time , it was also a refuelling point for aircraft , on the route between the Netherlands East Indies and major Australian cities . As a result , Broome was on a line of flight for Dutch and other refugees , following the Japanese invasion of Java , and had become a significant Allied military base . During a two-week period in February-March 1942 , more than a thousand refugees from the Dutch East Indies - many of them in flying boats , which often served as airliners at the time - passed through Broome . The number of refugees has previously been given as 8,000 , but new research by Dr Tom Lewis contends that this figure is massively overstated . The figure was first quoted in the relevant Australian Official War History and has been reproduced in many publications since . The actual number of aerial evacuees passing through Broome at this time is estimated to have been only 1,350 . Most of these were military personnel .

  "/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies": "The Dutch East Indies ( or Netherlands East-Indies ; Dutch : Nederlands ( ch ) -Indi\u00eb ; Indonesian : Hindia Belanda ) was a Dutch colony consisting of what is now Indonesia . It was formed from the nationalised colonies of the Dutch East India Company , which came under the administration of the Dutch government in 1800 . During the 19th century , the Dutch possessions and hegemony were expanded , reaching their greatest territorial extent in the early 20th century . This colony was one of the most valuable colonies under the Dutch Empire 's rule , and contributed to Dutch global prominence in spice and cash crop trade in the 19th to early 20th century . The colonial social order was based on rigid racial and social structures with a Dutch elite living separate from but linked to their native subjects . The term Indonesia came into use for the geographical location after 1880 . In the early 20th century , local intellectuals began developing the concept of Indonesia as a nation state , and set the stage for an independence movement . Japan 's World War II occupation dismantled much of the Dutch colonial state and economy . Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945 , Indonesian nationalists declared independence which they fought to secure during the subsequent Indonesian National Revolution . The Netherlands formally recognized sovereignty of the United States of Indonesia at the 1949 Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference with the exception of the Netherlands New Guinea ( Western New Guinea ) , whose administration was transferred under authority of Resolution 1752 ( XVII ) to the United Nations 13 years later in 1962 ( also see New York Agreement ) .",

On the evening of 10 February 1964 , the two ships were performing manoeuvres off Jervis Bay . Melbourne 's aircraft were performing flying exercises , and Voyager was tasked as plane guard , positioned behind and to port ( left ) of the carrier in order to rescue the crew of any ditching or crashing aircraft . After a series of turns effected to reverse the courses of the two ships , Voyager ended up ahead and to starboard ( right ) of the carrier . The destroyer was ordered to resume plane guard position , which would involve turning to starboard , away from the carrier , then looping around behind . Instead , Voyager began a starboard turn , but then came around to port . The bridge crew on Melbourne assumed that Voyager was zig-zagging to let the carrier overtake her , and would then assume her correct position . Senior personnel on Voyager were not paying attention to the manoeuvre . At 20:55 , officers on both ships began desperate avoiding manoeuvres , but by then a collision was inevitable . Melbourne struck Voyager at 20:56 , with the carrier 's bow striking just behind the bridge and cutting the destroyer in two .

Melbourne was the only Commonwealth naval vessel to sink two friendly warships in peacetime collisions . Melbourne was laid down for the Royal Navy as the lead ship of the Majestic class in April 1943 , and was launched as HMS Majestic ( R77 ) in February 1945 . At the end of the Second World War , work on the ship was suspended until she was purchased by the RAN in 1947 . At the time of purchase , it was decided to incorporate new aircraft carrier technologies into the design , making Melbourne the third ship to be constructed with an angled flight deck . Delays in construction and integrating the enhancements meant that the carrier was not commissioned until 1955 . Melbourne never fired a shot in anger during her service career , having only peripheral , non-combat roles in relation to the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation and the Vietnam War . She was , however , involved in two major collisions with allied vessels ; though Melbourne was found not to be the primary cause of either incident . The first collision occurred on the evening of 10 February 1964 , in which Melbourne rammed and sank the RAN destroyer HMAS Voyager , when the latter altered course across her bow . 82 of Voyager 's personnel were killed , and two Royal Commissions were held to investigate the incident . The second collision occurred in the early morning of 3 June 1969 , when Melbourne also rammed the United States Navy ( USN ) destroyer USS Frank E. Evans in similar circumstances . 74 American personnel died , and a joint USN-RAN Board of Inquiry was held .",

Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 .

Years of severe drought and extreme weather combined to create one of Australia 's worst fire days in a century . The fires became the deadliest bushfire in Australian history until the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 . In Victoria , 47 people died . There were 28 deaths in South Australia . This included 14 CFA and 3 CFS volunteer fire-fighters who died across both states that day . Many fatalities were as a result of firestorm conditions caused by a sudden and violent wind change in the evening which rapidly changed the direction and size of the fire front . The speed and ferocity of the flames , aided by abundant fuels and a landscape immersed in smoke , made fire suppression and containment impossible . In many cases , residents fended for themselves as fires broke communications , cut off escape routes and severed electricity and water supplies . Up to 8,000 people were evacuated in Victoria at the height of the crisis and a state of disaster was declared for the first time in South Australia 's history .

  "/wiki/Cyclone_Tracy": "Cyclone Tracy was a tropical cyclone that devastated the city of Darwin , Northern Territory , Australia from 24 to 26 December 1974 . The storm was the second-smallest tropical cyclone on record ( in terms of gale-force wind diameter ) , behind only Tropical Storm Marco in 2008 . The small , developing easterly storm had been observed passing clear of the city initially , but then turned towards it early on 24 December . After 10:00 p.m. ACST , damage became severe , and wind gusts reached 217 kilometres per hour ( 134.84 mph ) before instruments failed . Residents of Darwin were celebrating Christmas , and did not immediately acknowledge the emergency , partly because they had been alerted to an earlier cyclone ( Selma ) that passed west of the city . Additionally , news outlets had only a skeleton crew on duty over the holiday . Tracy killed 71 people , caused A $ 837 million in damage ( 1974 dollars ) , or approximately A $ 6.85 billion ( 2018 dollars ) , or $ 4.79 billion 2018 USD . It destroyed more than 70 percent of Darwin 's buildings , including 80 percent of houses .

  "/wiki/Tasmania": "Tasmania ( /t\u00e6z\u02c8me\u026ani\u0259/ ; abbreviated as TAS , nicknamed Tassie ) is an island state of Australia . It is located 240 km ( 150 mi ) to the south of the Australian mainland , separated by Bass Strait . The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania , the 26th-largest island in the world , and the surrounding 334 islands . The state has a population of around 533,308 as of March 2019 [ update ] . Just over forty percent of the population resides in the Greater Hobart precinct , which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city , Hobart . Tasmania 's area is 68,401 km2 ( 26,410 sq mi ) , of which the main island covers 64,519 km2 ( 24,911 sq mi ) . It is promoted as a natural state , and protected areas of Tasmania cover about 42% of its land area , which includes national parks and World Heritage Sites . Tasmania was the founding place of the first environmental political party in the world . The island is believed to have been occupied by indigenous peoples for 30,000 years before British colonisation . It is thought Aboriginal Tasmanians were separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 10,000 years ago when the sea rose to form Bass Strait . The Aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of colonisation , but was almost wiped out within 30 years by a combination of violent guerrilla conflict with settlers known as the Black War , intertribal conflict , and from the late 1820s , the spread of infectious diseases to which they had no immunity . The conflict , which peaked between 1825 and 1831 , and led to more than three years of martial law , cost the lives of almost 1,100 Aboriginals and settlers .",
