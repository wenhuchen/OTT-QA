England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills ) .",

  "/wiki/Wherwell": "Wherwell is a village on the River Test in Hampshire , England . The name may derive from its bubbling springs resulting in the Middle Ages place name Hwerwyl noted in AD 955 , possibly meaning kettle springs or cauldron springs . Pronunciation of the name has ranged from Hurrell to Wer-rel to present-day Wher-well . Before the Dissolution , the parish of Wherwell was in the hands of an important abbey of Benedictine nuns , whose abbess was Lady of the Manor of an area much larger than the existing parish . The town is associated with the Cockatrice . The story is that the cockatrice terrorised the village until it was imprisoned in the dungeons below Wherwell Priory . A prize of land was offered to anyone who could kill the creature . None were successful , until a man named Green lowered a mirror into the dungeon . The cockatrice battled against its own reflection until exhausted , at which point Green was able to kill it . Today there is an area of land near Wherwell called Green 's Acres . For many years a weather vane in the shape of a cockatrice adorned the church of St. Peter and Holy Cross in Wherwell until it was removed to Andover Museum .",
