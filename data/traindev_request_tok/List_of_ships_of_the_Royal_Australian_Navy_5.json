  "/wiki/HMAS_Darwin_(FFG_04)": "HMAS Darwin ( FFG 04 ) , named for the capital city of the Northern Territory , is an Adelaide-class guided-missile frigate , formerly in service with the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . One of four ships ordered from the United States , Darwin entered service in 1984 . During her career , she has operated in the Persian Gulf , as part of the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce , and off the Solomon Islands . The frigate underwent a major upgrade during 2007 and 2008 . She was decommissioned on 9 December 2017 and was supposed to be scuttled as a dive wreck in Tasmania , but the deal was pulled by the Tasmanian Government and her fate remains uncertain .",
  "/wiki/Adelaide-class_frigate": "The Adelaide class was a ship class of six guided missile frigates constructed in Australia and the United States of America for service in the Royal Australian Navy . The class was based on the United States Navy 's Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates , but modified for Australian requirements . The first four vessels were built in the United States , while the other two were constructed in Australia . The first ship entered service in November 1980 . Canberra and Adelaide were paid off in 2005 and 2008 respectively , and later sunk as dive wrecks : their decommissioning was to offset the cost of a A $ 1 billion weapons and equipment upgrade to the remaining four ships . Sydney was decommissioned in late 2015 , after spending most of the year as a moored training ship . Darwin was decommissioned in late 2017 , Newcastle in June 2019 and Melbourne the last in October 2019 . The Hobart-class air-warfare destroyers progressively replaced the last four frigates from 2016 onwards .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Deloraine": "HMAS Deloraine ( J232/M232 ) , named for the town of Deloraine , Tasmania , was one of 60 Bathurst-class corvettes constructed during World War II , and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . In January 1942 she evaded an attack by the Japanese submarine I-124 north-west of Darwin and was jointly credited with the submarines ' sinking after she inflicted the initial damage . She was present at the bombing of Darwin and survived unscathed .",
  "/wiki/Bathurst-class_corvette": "The Bathurst-class corvettes were a class of general purpose vessels produced in Australia during World War II . Originally classified as minesweepers , but widely referred to as corvettes , the Bathurst-class vessels fulfilled a broad anti-submarine , anti-mine , and convoy escort role . Sixty Bathurst-class corvettes were built in eight Australian shipyards to an Australian design . 36 were constructed for the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , 20 were built on British Admiralty orders but manned and commissioned by the RAN , and 4 served in the Royal Indian Navy . Three more were ordered for construction in India , but were cancelled . Although designed for the anti-submarine and anti-mine role , the Bathursts operated as maids-of-all-work during the war ; serving as troop and supply transports , supporting amphibious landings , providing air defence for convoys and disabled ships , participating in shore bombardments , and undertaking hydrographic surveys . Three ships were lost during the war - one to Japanese air attack and two to collisions with friendly merchant ships - while a fourth struck a friendly mine while sweeping the Great Barrier Reef in 1947 and sank . After the war , the Admiralty ships were sold to the Turkish Navy , Royal Netherlands Navy , and civilian operators , while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy , temporarily reactivated to facilitate National Service Training , or sold to civilians . Four of the Netherlands Bathursts were sold onward to the Indonesian Navy , one of which was destroyed in 1956 by rebels opposing the 'Guided Democracy ' political system . The rest of the RAN and Admiralty ships were sold for scrap to help fund other projects . Two vessels are preserved as museum ships .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Derwent_(DE_49)": "HMAS Derwent ( F22/DE 22/DE 49 ) , named for the Derwent River , was a River-class destroyer escort of the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . She was laid down by Williamstown Naval Dockyard in 1959 , and commissioned into the RAN in 1964 . During the ship 's career , she was deployed to South East Asia on 23 occasions , including operations during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation , and escort of the troopship HMAS Sydney to and from the Vietnam War . Multiple flag-showing cruises were also embarked upon , with port visits throughout Asia , the Indian Ocean , and the Pacific Ocean . Derwent was also briefly used to portray a fictional vessel for the British drama series Warship . A major modernisation occurred between 1981 and 1985 . In 1987 , the ship 's home port was changed to HMAS Stirling ( Fleet Base West ) . In addition to usual exercises and operations , Derwent assisted with the 1987 America 's Cup and the First Fleet Re-enactment Voyage . Between 1992 and 1993 , the ship was used for pilotage training cruises . Derwent was paid off in 1994 , and used by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation ( DSTO ) for ship survivability testing . Although it was originally intended to sink the ship as a dive wreck , the nature of the damage from the DSTO program made it unaffordable to render the ship diver-safe , so Derwent was towed to deep water off Rottnest Island and scuttled .",
  "/wiki/River-class_destroyer_escort": "The River class was a class of six destroyer escorts ( originally designated anti-submarine frigates ) operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Plans to acquire four vessels , based on the British Type 12M ( or Rothesay-class ) frigate , began in the 1950s . The first two vessels had some slight modifications to the design , while the next two underwent further changes . Two more ships were ordered in 1964 , following the Melbourne-Voyager collision ; these were based on the Type 12I ( or Leander-class ) frigate . By the 1990s , all six ships had left service . Two were sunk as part of tests , and a third was scuttled as an artificial reef , while the other three ships were scrapped .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Diamantina_(K377)": "HMAS Diamantina ( K377/F377/A266/GOR266 ) , named after the Diamantina River in Queensland , is a River-class frigate that served the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Constructed in the mid-1940s , Diamantina was active from 1945 until 1946 , was placed in reserve , then was recommissioned as a survey ship from 1959 until 1980 . Following her second decommissioning , the frigate was preserved at the Queensland Maritime Museum as a museum ship . She was the last World War II-era frigate to leave RAN service , and of the 151 River-class frigates constructed for 19 navies worldwide , Diamantina is the only one preserved as a museum ship .",
  "/wiki/River-class_frigate": "The River class was a class of 151 frigates launched between 1941 and 1944 for use as anti-submarine convoy escorts in the North Atlantic . The majority served with the Royal Navy ( RN ) and Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) , with some serving in the other Allied navies : the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , the Free French Navy ( FFN ) , the Royal Netherlands Navy and , post-war , the South African Navy ( SAN ) . The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 , and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom , giving name to the class . In Canada , they were named for towns and cities , though they kept the same designation . Originally called a twin-screw corvette , the name frigate was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy . Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941 . The design was too big for the locks on the Lachine Canal so it was not built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal . In all , Canada ordered the construction of 70 frigates , including ten for the Royal Navy , which transferred two to the United States Navy . Twelve were built in Australia for the RAN ( four to a modified design ) . After World War II , they found employment in many other navies the world over ; several RCN ships were sunk as breakwaters . One , HMCS Stormont , was purchased by Aristotle Onassis and converted into the luxury yacht Christina O .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Doomba": "HMAS Doomba was a Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) warship of World War II . Built for the Royal Navy around the end of World War I as the Hunt-class minesweeper HMS Wexford , the ship only saw two years of service before she was decommissioned in 1921 and sold to the Doomba Shipping Company . The vessel was renamed SS Doomba , converted into a passenger ship , and operated in the waters around Brisbane until 1939 , when she was requisitioned by the RAN for wartime service . Serving first as an auxiliary minehunter , then an auxiliary anti-submarine vessel , HMAS Doomba was purchased outright by the RAN in 1940 , and served until early 1946 , when she was sold and converted into a linseed oil lighter . Doomba was scuttled off Dee Why , New South Wales in 1976 .",
  "/wiki/Hunt-class_minesweeper_(1916)": "The Hunt-class minesweeper was a class of minesweeping sloop built between 1916 and 1919 for the Royal Navy . They were built in two discrete groups , the earlier Belvoir group designed by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company and the subsequent ( and slightly larger ) Aberdare group designed by the Admiralty . They were classed as Fleet Minesweeping Sloops , that is ships intended to clear open water . The Belvoir group were named after British fox hunts . Those of the Aberdare group were originally named after coastal towns , watering places and fishing ports , some of which happened to be hunts by coincidence . However , all were soon renamed after inland locations to prevent confusion caused by the misunderstanding of signals and orders .",

  "/wiki/Fremantle-class_patrol_boat": "The Fremantle-class patrol boats were coastal patrol vessels operated by the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) from 1979 to 2007 . Designed by British shipbuilder Brooke Marine and constructed in Australia by North Queensland Engineers and Agents , the Fremantle class were larger , more powerful , and more capable than the preceding Attack class , and the two primary patrol boat bases required infrastructure upgrades to support them . Although up to 30 vessels were planned , fifteen were ordered and constructed , with an unexercised option for five more . Their retirement was announced in 2001 and a decommissioning schedule published in 2004 . From May 2005 they were replaced by the Armidale-class patrol boats with the last two Fremantles decommissioning in May 2007 . Most of the class were scrapped , with two marked for preservation as museum ships . The Fremantle class has also appeared in two drama television series based on the Royal Australian Navy .",
  "/wiki/HMAS_Duchess_(D154)": "HMAS Duchess was a Daring-class destroyer that served in the Royal Navy as HMS Duchess from 1952 to 1964 , and in the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) from 1964 to 1980 . She was laid down by John I. Thornycroft and Company , and commissioned into the Royal Navy in 1952 . Initially assigned to the Home Fleet , Duchess spent her early career on exercises and port visits . She was involved in celebrations for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II during 1953 , and escorted the royal yacht Britannia in 1954 . The destroyer was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet in late 1954 , and was involved in exercises , port visits , and anti-weapons-smuggling patrols of Cyprus . During the 1956 Suez Crisis , Duchess operated as plane guard and escort to the British carrier force , and was the last ship to leave Port Said after the British-French invasion failed . The destroyer was reassigned to the Home Fleet in early 1957 , then was sent back to the Mediterranean as leader of the 5th Destroyer Squadron later that year . A modernisation refit ran from late 1958 to the start of 1961 , after which , Duchess resumed operations with the Mediterranean Fleet . In 1963 , tensions leading to the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation resulted in Duchess being assigned to the Far East Fleet as part of a strengthening of British assets in South East Asia . Following the 1964 Melbourne-Voyager collision , Duchess was loaned to the RAN as a temporary replacement for Voyager . The ship was deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve throughout the 1960s , and operated as an escort for the Vietnam War troopship Sydney on several occasions . The original four-year loan was extended to 1972 , at which point the ship was purchased outright by the Australian government .",
  "/wiki/Daring-class_destroyer_(1949)": "The Daring class was a class of eleven destroyers built for the Royal Navy ( RN ) and Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Constructed after World War II , and entering service during the 1950s , eight ships were constructed for the RN , and three ships for the RAN . Two of the RN destroyers were subsequently sold to and served in the Peruvian Navy ( MGP ) . A further eight ships were planned for the RN but were cancelled before construction commenced , while a fourth RAN vessel was begun but was cancelled before launch and broken up on the slipway . The Daring-class ships were both the largest and most heavily armed ships serving in Commonwealth navies to be classified as destroyers . They were intended to fill some of the duties of Cruisers , which post WW2 were considered both expensive and obsolete by Naval Planners , and were briefly officially considered a hybrid type ( Darings ) before being rated as destroyers . They were also the last destroyers of the RN and RAN to possess guns as their main armament ( instead of guided missiles ) , which saw use during the Indonesian Confrontation and the Vietnam War . The Daring-class destroyers were in service in the RN and RAN from the 1950s to the 1980s . Following decommissioning , two RN Darings were sold to Peru , which operated one ship until 1993 and the other until 2007 . One ship of the class is preserved : HMAS Vampire as a museum ship at the Australian National Maritime Museum .",
