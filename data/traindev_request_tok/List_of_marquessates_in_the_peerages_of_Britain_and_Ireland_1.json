The second Scottish creation was in 1651 , and became extinct in 1715 . The Earldom of Ormonde , and later Marquisate of Ormond , in the Peerage of Scotland , originates from the caput of Ormond Castle at Avoch in the Black Isle , held by the Douglas family when they first obtained the title . Between 1488 and 1504 it was a subsidiary title of the Dukes of Ross , until the latter 's extinction in 1504 .

The Dukedom , named after the Clan Gordon , was first created for the 4th Marquess of Huntly , who on 3 November 1684 was created Duke of Gordon , Marquess of Huntly , Earl of Huntly and Enzie ( all three of which he already held by an older creation ) , Viscount of Inverness , and Lord Strathaven , Balmore , Auchindoun , Garthie and Kincardine . On 2 July 1784 , the 4th Duke was created Earl of Norwich , in the County of Norfolk , and Baron Gordon , of Huntley in the County of Gloucester , in the Peerage of Great Britain . The principal family seat was Gordon Castle . The Dukedom became extinct in 1836 , along with all the titles created in 1684 and 1784 . Most of the Gordon estates passed to the son of the 5th Duke 's eldest sister , the 5th Duke of Richmond , whose main seat was Goodwood House in Sussex . In 1876 his son , the 6th Duke of Richmond and Lennox , was created Duke of Gordon , of Gordon Castle in Scotland , and Earl of Kinrara , in the County of Inverness . Thus , the Duke holds four dukedoms ( including the titular Aubigny-sur-N\u00e8re ; see Duke of Aubigny ) , more than any other person in the realm . Aubigny is in the defunct Peerage of France and the central arms of the Duke are based on the original Jacobean ones for the Union of the Crowns , with the inherited but inactive English claims to the French throne also represented prominently .",

  "/wiki/Duke_of_York": "Duke of York is a title of nobility in the Peerage of the United Kingdom . Since the 15th century , it has , when granted , usually been given to the second son of English ( later British ) monarchs . The equivalent title in the Scottish peerage was Duke of Albany . However , King George I and Queen Victoria granted the second sons of their eldest sons the titles Duke of York and Albany and Duke of York respectively . Initially granted in the 14th century in the Peerage of England , the title Duke of York has been created eight times . The title Duke of York and Albany has been created three times . These occurred during the 18th century , following the 1707 unification of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland into a single , united realm . The double naming was done so that a territorial designation from each of the previously separate realms could be included . The current Duke of York is Prince Andrew , the second son of Queen Elizabeth II . The present Duke 's marriage produced two daughters only , and he has remained unmarried since his 1996 divorce . It therefore seems likely that the eighth creation of the title will be only the second ( after Richard of Shrewsbury ) not to become merged into the Crown upon the holder 's accession to the role of monarch .",
  "/wiki/Peerage_of_England": "The Peerage of England comprises all peerages created in the Kingdom of England before the Act of Union in 1707 . In that year , the Peerages of England and Scotland were replaced by one Peerage of Great Britain . English Peeresses obtained their first seats in the House of Lords under the Peerage Act 1963 from which date until the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999 all Peers of England could sit in the House of Lords . The ranks of the English peerage are , in descending order , Duke , Marquess , Earl , Viscount , and Baron . While most newer English peerages descend only in the male line , many of the older ones ( particularly older baronies ) can descend through females . Such peerages follow the old English inheritance law of moieties so all daughters ( or granddaughters through the same root ) stand as co-heirs , so some such titles are in such a state of abeyance between these . Baronets , while holders of hereditary titles , as such are not peers and not entitled to stand for internal delegation , that is election , in the House of Lords . Knights , Dames and holders of other non-hereditary orders , decorations and medals are also not peers . In the following table , each peer is listed only by his or her highest English title ( with the exception of the Duke of Norfolk/Earl of Arundel ) showing higher or equal titles in the other peerages .

One of the last Welsh princes , Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , was killed in battle in 1282 by Edward I , King of England , whose son Edward ( born in Caernarfon Castle in 1284 ) was invested as the first English Prince of Wales in 1301 . Since the 14th century , the title has been a dynastic title granted to the heir apparent to the English or British monarch , but the failure to be granted the title does not affect the rights to royal succession . The title is granted to the heir apparent as a personal honour or dignity , and is not heritable , merging with the Crown on accession to the throne . The title Earl of Chester is always given in conjunction with that of Prince of Wales . The Prince of Wales usually has other titles and honours . The current and longest-serving Prince of Wales is Prince Charles , the eldest son of Elizabeth II , who is Queen of the United Kingdom and 15 other independent Commonwealth realms as well as Head of the 53-member Commonwealth of Nations . The wife of the Prince of Wales is entitled to the title Princess of Wales . Prince Charles 's first wife , Diana , used that title , but his second wife , Camilla , uses only the title Duchess of Cornwall ( or of Rothesay when in Scotland ) because the other title has become so popularly associated with Diana .",

The Duke of Rothesay also holds other Scottish titles , including those of Earl of Carrick , Baron of Renfrew , Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland .

  "/wiki/Duke_of_Buccleuch": "The title Duke of Buccleuch /b\u0259\u02c8klu\u02d0/ , formerly also spelt Duke of Buccleugh , is a title in the Peerage of Scotland created twice on 20 April 1663 , first for James Scott , 1st Duke of Monmouth and second suo jure for his wife Anne Scott , 4th Countess of Buccleuch . Monmouth , the eldest illegitimate son of Charles II was attainted after his 1685 rebellion , but his wife 's title was unaffected and passed on to their descendants , who have successively borne the surnames Scott , Montagu-Scott , Montagu Douglas Scott and Scott again . In 1810 , the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch inherited the Dukedom of Queensberry , also in the Peerage of Scotland , thus separating that title from the Marquessate of Queensberry . The substantial origin of the ducal house of the Scotts of Buccleuch dates back to the large grants of lands in Scotland to Sir Walter Scott of Kirkurd and Buccleuch , a border chief , by James II , in consequence of the fall of William Douglas , 8th Earl of Douglas ( 1452 ) , but the family traced their descent back to a Sir Richard le Scott ( 1240-1285 ) . Sir Walter Scott of Branxholme and Buccleuch ( died 1552 ) distinguished himself at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh ( 1547 ) . His great-grandson Sir Walter was created Lord Scott of Buccleuch in 1606 . Other subsidiary titles associated with the Dukedom of Buccleuch are : Earl of Buccleuch ( 1619 ) , Earl of Dalkeith ( 1663 ) and Lord Scott of Whitchester and Eskdaill ( 1619 ) ( all in the Peerage of Scotland ) . The Duke also holds the two subsidiary titles of the attainted Dukedom of Monmouth , namely Earl of Doncaster ( 1663 ) and Baron Scott of Tindale ( 1663 ) ( both in the Peerage of England ) , and several subsidiary titles associated with the Dukedom of Queensberry , namely Marquess of Dumfriesshire ( 1683 ) , Earl of Drumlanrig and Sanquhar ( 1682 ) , Viscount of Nith , Tortholwald and Ross ( 1682 ) and Lord Douglas of Kilmount , Middlebie and Dornock ( 1682 ) ( all in the Peerage of Scotland ) . The Earldom of Doncaster and Barony of Scott of Tindale had been forfeit at the time of the first Duke 's attainder , but the titles were restored to the 2nd Duke of Buccleuch in 1742 . Until 1835 , the Dukes also held lands in the West Riding of Yorkshire and the ancient title of Lord of Bowland . The Duke of Buccleuch is the hereditary chief of Clan Scott . The holder is one of only five people in the UK to hold two or more different dukedoms , the others being the Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay , the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon , the Duke of Argyll ( who holds two dukedoms named Argyll ) , and the Duke of Richmond , Lennox and Gordon .",
