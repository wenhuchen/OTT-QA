  "/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award": "The Primetime Emmy Award is an American award bestowed by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences ( ATAS ) in recognition of excellence in American primetime television programming . First given out in 1949 , the award was originally referred to as simply the Emmy Awards until the first Daytime Emmy Award ceremony was held in 1974 and the word prime time was added to distinguish between the two . The Primetime Emmy Awards generally air in mid-September , on the Sunday before the official start of the fall television season . They are currently seen in rotation among the four major networks ( ABC , CBS , FOX , NBC ) . The ceremony is typically moved to late-August if it is broadcast by NBC ( such as in 2006 , 2010 , and 2014 ) , so that it does not conflict with NBC 's commitment to broadcasting Sunday-night NFL games ( due to another conflict , this time with the MTV Video Music Awards , the 2014 ceremony was also shifted to a Monday ) . However , the 2018 ceremony , broadcast by NBC , was moved back to September and aired on a Monday . They are considered television 's equivalent to the Academy Awards ( film ) , Grammy Awards ( music ) , and Tony Awards ( theater ) . The awards are divided into three categories : Primetime Emmy Awards , Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards , and Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards .",
  "/wiki/Progress_Medal_(RPS)": "The Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain , commonly known as the Royal Photographic Society ( RPS ) , is one of the world 's oldest photographic societies . It was founded in London , England , in 1853 as the Photographic Society of London with the objective of promoting the art and science of photography , and in 1853 received Royal patronage from Queen Victoria and Prince Albert . The Duchess of Cambridge became the Society 's Patron on 25 June 2019 , taking over from Her Majesty the Queen who had been patron since 1952 . A change to the society 's name to reflect the Royal patronage was , however , not considered expedient at the time . In 1874 it was renamed the Photographic Society of Great Britain , and from 1894 it became known as the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain . A registered charity since 1962 , in July 2004 , The Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain was granted a Royal charter recognising its eminence in the field of photography as a learned society . For most of its history the Society was based at various premises in London . It moved to Bath in 1979 , where it remained until 2019 . In January 2019 , the society opened its new headquarters and gallery in Bristol , England . Membership remains international and open to anyone with an interest in photography . In addition to standard membership , the Society also offers three levels of distinctions Licentiate , Associate and Fellow , which set recognised standards of achievement throughout the world , and can be applied for by both members and non-members , in all aspects of photography and vocational qualifications in the areas of Creative Industries and Imaging Science . The Society runs a programme of more than 300 events throughout the United Kingdom and abroad , through local groups and special interest groups .",

  "/wiki/Logic_gate": "A logic gate is an idealized or physical electronic device implementing a Boolean function , a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output . Depending on the context , the term may refer to an ideal logic gate , one that has for instance zero rise time and unlimited fan-out , or it may refer to a non-ideal physical device ( see Ideal and real op-amps for comparison ) . Logic gates are primarily implemented using diodes or transistors acting as electronic switches , but can also be constructed using vacuum tubes , electromagnetic relays ( relay logic ) , fluidic logic , pneumatic logic , optics , molecules , or even mechanical elements . With amplification , logic gates can be cascaded in the same way that Boolean functions can be composed , allowing the construction of a physical model of all of Boolean logic , and therefore , all of the algorithms and mathematics that can be described with Boolean logic . Logic circuits include such devices as multiplexers , registers , arithmetic logic units ( ALUs ) , and computer memory , all the way up through complete microprocessors , which may contain more than 100 million gates . In modern practice , most gates are made from MOSFETs ( metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors ) . Compound logic gates AND-OR-Invert ( AOI ) and OR-AND-Invert ( OAI ) are often employed in circuit design because their construction using MOSFETs is simpler and more efficient than the sum of the individual gates . In reversible logic , Toffoli gates are used .",
