In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century .

New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century .

Until the mid-20th century , most of Sussex County 's economy was based on agriculture ( chiefly dairy farming ) and the mining industry . With the decline of these industries in the 1960s , Sussex County was transformed into a bedroom community that absorbed population shifts from New Jersey 's more heavily populated areas . Recent studies estimate that 60% of Sussex County residents work outside of the county , many seeking or maintaining employment in New York City or New Jersey 's more suburban and urban areas .",
