It is 120 kilometers ( 75 mi ) long and runs 30-100 meters under the surface in bedrock . The purpose of the tunnel is to provide fresh water for the million plus people in Southern Finland in the cities of Helsinki , Espoo , Vantaa , Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 , J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 , Kerava , Kauniainen , Kirkkonummi , Sipoo , and Tuusula . The former Porvoo Rural Municipality , now merged with the municipality of Porvoo , also took part in the building of the scheme but has never drawn water from it for domestic use . The tunnel starts at Asikkalanselk\u00e4 in Lake P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne , which is the second largest lake in Finland , with an area of 1,080 square kilometres . The tunnel slopes slightly downhill so that water flows naturally . Water from the southern portion of Lake P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne is of rather good quality at the water tunnel intake and is usually drinkable without processing . The tunnel ends at the Silvola reservoir in Vantaa in the Greater Helsinki area . From the reservoir covering 0.5 square kilometres , water is pumped to water treatment plants in Pitk\u00e4koski and Vanhakaupunki . Since the constant low temperature in the deep tunnel ensures high quality during transport , only minimal processing is required before use . Tunnel construction started in 1972 and was completed in 1982 at a cost of approximately \u20ac200 million ( adjusted for inflation ) . In 1999 and 2001 , portions of the tunnel required repair due to rock falls .",

In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence . The post-independence period was tumultuous , characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes .",

On the Pearl River about 120 km ( 75 mi ) north-northwest of Hong Kong and 145 km ( 90 mi ) north of Macau , Guangzhou has a history of over 2,200 years and was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road , and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub , as well as one of China 's three largest cities . Guangzhou is at the heart of the most-populous built-up metropolitan area in mainland China that extends into the neighboring cities of Foshan , Dongguan , Zhongshan and Shenzhen , forming one of the largest urban agglomerations on Earth . Administratively , the city holds sub-provincial status and is one of China 's nine National Central Cities . At the end of 2018 , the population of the city 's expansive administrative area is estimated at 14,904,400 by city authorities , up 3.8% year from the previous year . Guangzhou is ranked as an Alpha global city . There is a rapidly increasing number of foreign temporary residents and immigrants from Southeast Asia , the Middle East , Eastern Europe and Africa . This has led to it being dubbed the Capital of the Third World . The domestic migrant population from other provinces of China in Guangzhou was 40% of the city 's total population in 2008 . Together with Shanghai , Beijing and Shenzhen , Guangzhou has one of the most expensive real estate markets in China . In the late 1990s and early 2000s , nationals of sub-Saharan Africa who had initially settled in the Middle East and other parts of Southeast Asia moved in unprecedented numbers to Guangzhou in response to the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis .

  "/wiki/Gotthard_Base_Tunnel": "The Gotthard Base Tunnel ( GBT ; German : Gotthard-Basistunnel , Italian : Galleria di base del San Gottardo , Romansh : Tunnel da basa dal Son Gottard ) is a railway tunnel through the Alps in Switzerland . It opened on 1 June 2016 , and full service began on 11 December 2016 . With a route length of 57.09 km ( 35.5 mi ) , it is the world 's longest railway and deepest traffic tunnel [ note 1 ] and the first flat , low-level route through the Alps . It lies at the heart of the Gotthard axis and constitutes the third tunnel connecting the cantons of Uri and Ticino , after the Gotthard Tunnel and the Gotthard Road Tunnel . The link consists of two single-track tunnels connecting Erstfeld ( Uri ) with Bodio ( Ticino ) and passing below Sedrun ( Graub\u00fcnden ) . It is part of the New Railway Link through the Alps ( NRLA ) project , which also includes the Ceneri Base Tunnel further south ( scheduled to open late 2020 ) and the L\u00f6tschberg Base Tunnel on the other main north-south axis . It is referred to as a base tunnel since it bypasses most of the existing Gotthard railway line , a winding mountain route opened in 1882 across the Saint-Gotthard Massif , which was operating at its capacity before the opening of the GBT . The new base tunnel establishes a direct route usable by high-speed rail and heavy freight trains . The main purpose of the Gotthard Base Tunnel is to increase local transport capacity through the Alpine barrier , especially for freight , notably on the Rotterdam-Basel-Genoa corridor , and more specifically to shift freight volumes from trucks to freight trains . This both significantly reduces the danger of fatal road crashes involving trucks , and reduces the environmental damage caused by heavy trucks . The tunnel provides a faster connection between the canton of Ticino and the rest of Switzerland , as well as between northern and southern Europe , cutting the Basel/Z\u00fcrich-Lugano-Milan journey time for passenger trains by one hour ( and from Lucerne to Bellinzona by 45 minutes ) . After 64 percent of Swiss voters accepted the NRLA project in a 1992 referendum , first preparatory and exploratory work began in 1996 .",

The Swiss Alps extend over both the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps , encompassing an area sometimes called Central Alps . While the northern ranges from the Bernese Alps to the Appenzell Alps are entirely in Switzerland , the southern ranges from the Mont Blanc massif to the Bernina massif are shared with other countries such as France , Italy , Austria and Liechtenstein . The Swiss Alps comprise almost all the highest mountains of the Alps , such as Dufourspitze ( 4,634 m ) , the Dom ( 4,545 m ) , the Liskamm ( 4,527 m ) , the Weisshorn ( 4,506 m ) and the Matterhorn ( 4,478 m ) .

While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory , the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau , where the largest cities are located , among them the two global cities and economic centres of Z\u00fcrich and Geneva . The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period , resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy . Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day . Since the Reformation of the 16th century , Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality ; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002 . Nevertheless , it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world .

It is a generalization of the notion of a straight line to a more general setting . The term geodesic comes from geodesy , the science of measuring the size and shape of Earth . In the original sense , a geodesic was the shortest route between two points on the Earth 's surface . For a spherical Earth , it is a segment of a great circle . The term has been generalized to include measurements in much more general mathematical spaces ; for example , in graph theory , one might consider a geodesic between two vertices/nodes of a graph . In a Riemannian manifold or submanifold geodesics are characterised by the property of having vanishing geodesic curvature . More generally , in the presence of an affine connection , a geodesic is defined to be a curve whose tangent vectors remain parallel if they are transported along it . Applying this to the Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian metric recovers the previous notion . Geodesics are of particular importance in general relativity . Timelike geodesics in general relativity describe the motion of free falling test particles .",

However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos , Faustus of Byzantium , Ghazar Parpetsi , Koryun , and Sebeos . The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk ( \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f ) , the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah , who , according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene ( Movsis Khorenatsi ) , defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region . The further origin of the name is uncertain . It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated , Hittite vassal states - the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi ( 1600-1200 BC ) .

[ note 1 ] The first section of the MRT opened on 7 November 1987 , and the network has since grown rapidly in accordance with Singapore 's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the backbone of the country 's public transportation system , with an average daily ridership of 3.384 million in 2019 , [ note 2 ] approximately 83% of the bus network 's 4.099 million in the same period . Singapore 's MRT infrastructure is built , operated , and managed in accordance with a hybridised quasi-nationalised regulatory framework called the New Rail Financing Framework ( NRFF ) , in which the lines are constructed and the assets owned by the Land Transport Authority , a statutory board of the Government of Singapore . The Land Transport Authority allocates operating concessions to two for-profit private corporations , namely SMRT and SBS Transit , both of which are responsible for asset maintenance on their respective lines . These operators also run bus and taxi services , thus facilitating the full integration of public transport services . As of January 2020 , the MRT network encompasses 203 kilometres ( 126 mi ) of route on standard gauge , with 122 stations in operation , spread across six lines set in a circle-radial topology . The network is expected to double to a total length of almost 400 kilometres ( 250 mi ) by 2040 as a result of ongoing expansion works to its six existing lines and the construction of three new lines . The network is complemented by a small number of local Light Rail Transit ( LRT ) networks in the suburban towns of Bukit Panjang , Sengkang , and Punggol that link MRT stations with HDB public housing estates , bringing the combined length of the domestic heavy and light rail network to 231.6 kilometres ( 143.9 mi ) , with a total of 159 stations in operation .

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",
