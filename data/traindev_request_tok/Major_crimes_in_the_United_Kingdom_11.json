  "/wiki/Burke_and_Hare_murders": "The Burke and Hare murders were a series of 16 killings committed over a period of about ten months in 1828 in Edinburgh , Scotland . They were undertaken by William Burke and William Hare , who sold the corpses to Robert Knox for dissection at his anatomy lectures . Edinburgh was a leading European centre of anatomical study in the early 19th century , in a time when the demand for cadavers led to a shortfall in legal supply . Scottish law required that corpses used for medical research should only come from those who had died in prison , suicide victims , or from foundlings and orphans . The shortage of corpses led to an increase in body snatching by what were known as resurrection men . Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed - such as the use of mortsafes - exacerbated the shortage . When a lodger in Hare 's house died , Hare turned to his friend Burke for advice and they decided to sell the body to Knox . They received what was , for them , the generous sum of \u00a37 10s . A little over two months later , when Hare was concerned that a lodger suffering from fever would deter others from staying in the house , he and Burke murdered her and sold the body to Knox . The men continued their murder spree , probably with the knowledge of their wives . Burke and Hare 's actions were uncovered after other lodgers discovered their last victim , Margaret Docherty , and contacted the police . A forensic examination of Docherty 's body indicated she had probably been suffocated , but this could not be proven .",

Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century , Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government , the Scottish Parliament and the supreme courts of Scotland . The city 's Palace of Holyroodhouse is the official residence of the monarch in Scotland . The city has long been a centre of education , particularly in the fields of medicine , Scots law , literature , philosophy , the sciences and engineering . It is the second largest financial centre in the United Kingdom ( after London ) and the city 's historical and cultural attractions have made it the United Kingdom 's second most popular tourist destination attracting 1.75 million visits from overseas in 2016 . Edinburgh is Scotland 's second most populous city and the seventh most populous in the United Kingdom . The official population estimates are 488,050 ( 2016 ) for the Locality of Edinburgh ( Edinburgh pre 1975 regionalisation plus Currie and Balerno ) , 518,500 ( 2018 ) for the City of Edinburgh , and 1,339,380 ( 2014 ) for the city region .

It is likely that she murdered three of her four husbands , apparently in order to collect on their insurance policies , and many others .

  "/wiki/Arsenic": "Arsenic is a chemical element with the symbol As and atomic number 33 . Arsenic occurs in many minerals , usually in combination with sulfur and metals , but also as a pure elemental crystal . Arsenic is a metalloid . It has various allotropes , but only the gray form , which has a metallic appearance , is important to industry . The primary use of arsenic is in alloys of lead ( for example , in car batteries and ammunition ) . Arsenic is a common n-type dopant in semiconductor electronic devices , and the optoelectronic compound gallium arsenide is the second most commonly used semiconductor after doped silicon . Arsenic and its compounds , especially the trioxide , are used in the production of pesticides , treated wood products , herbicides , and insecticides . These applications are declining due to the toxicity of arsenic and its compounds . A few species of bacteria are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory metabolites . Trace quantities of arsenic are an essential dietary element in rats , hamsters , goats , chickens , and presumably other species . A role in human metabolism is not known . However , arsenic poisoning occurs in multicellular life if quantities are larger than needed .",
  "/wiki/Amelia_Dyer": "Amelia Elizabeth Dyer ( n\u00e9e Hobley ; 1837 - 10 June 1896 ) was one of the most prolific serial killers in history , murdering infants in her care over a 30-year period in Victorian Britain . Trained as a nurse , and widowed in 1869 , she turned to baby farming - the practice of adopting unwanted infants in exchange for money - to support herself . She initially cared for the children legitimately , in addition to having two of her own , but whether intentionally or not , a number of them died in her care , leading to a conviction for negligence and six months ' hard labor . She then began directly murdering children she adopted , strangling at least some of them , and disposing of the bodies to avoid attention . Mentally unstable , she was committed to several mental asylums throughout her life , despite suspicions of feigning , and survived at least one serious suicide attempt . Dyer 's downfall came when the bagged corpse of an infant was discovered in the Thames , with evidence leading to her . She was arrested on 4 April 1896 , tried for the murder of infant Doris Marmon , and hanged on 10 June 1896 . At the time of her death , a handful of murders were attributed to her , but there is little doubt she was responsible for many more similar deaths - possibly 400 or more . Dubbed the Ogress of Reading , she inspired a popular ballad , and her case led to stricter laws for adoption .",
  "/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire": "Reading ( /\u02c8r\u025bd\u026a\u014b/ ( listen ) RED-ing ) is a large , historic university and minster town in Berkshire , South East England . It is in the Thames Valley at the confluence of the River Thames and River Kennet , and on both the Great Western Main Line railway and the M4 motorway . Reading is 70 miles ( 110 km ) east of Bristol , 24 miles ( 39 km ) south of Oxford , 40 miles ( 64 km ) west of London , 14 miles ( 23 km ) north of Basingstoke , 12 miles ( 19 km ) south-west of Maidenhead and 15 miles ( 24 km ) east of Newbury . The first evidence for Reading as a town dates from the 8th century . It was an important trading and ecclesiastical centre in the medieval period , as the site of Reading Abbey , one of the largest and richest monasteries of medieval England with strong royal connections , of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain . By 1525 , Reading was the largest town in Berkshire , and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth . The medieval town was seriously affected by the English Civil War , with a major siege and loss of trade , and played a pivotal role in the Revolution of 1688 , with that revolution 's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town . The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous . The 19th century saw the coming of the Great Western Railway and the development of the town 's brewing , baking and seed growing businesses . During that period , the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre . Today , [ when ? ] Reading is a major commercial centre , with involvement in information technology and insurance , and despite its proximity to London , has a net inward commuter flow .",
  "/wiki/Jack_the_Ripper": "Jack the Ripper was an unidentified serial killer active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888 . In both the criminal case files and contemporary journalistic accounts , the killer was called the Whitechapel Murderer and Leather Apron . Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations . The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge . Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888 , and letters were received by media outlets and Scotland Yard from a writer or writers purporting to be the murderer . The name Jack the Ripper originated in a letter written by an individual claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media . The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers ' circulation . The From Hell letter received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee came with half of a preserved human kidney , purportedly taken from one of the victims . The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as Jack the Ripper , mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal nature of the murders , and because of media treatment of the events . Extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper , and the legend solidified . A police investigation into a series of eleven brutal killings in Whitechapel up to 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888 . Five victims - Mary Ann Nichols , Annie Chapman , Elizabeth Stride , Catherine Eddowes , and Mary Jane Kelly - are known as the canonical five and their murders between 31 August and 9 November 1888 are often considered the most likely to be linked .",

It was split off as a separate parish in the 14th century . It became part of the County of London in 1889 and Greater London in 1965 . Because the area is close to the London Docklands and east of the City of London , it has been a popular place for immigrants and the working class . The area was the centre of the London Jewish community in the 19th and early 20th century , and the location of the infamous 11 Whitechapel murders ( 1888-91 ) , some of which were attributed to the mysterious serial killer known as Jack the Ripper . In the latter half of the 20th century , Whitechapel became a significant settlement for the British Bangladeshi community , and has the Royal London Hospital and East London Mosque .",
  "/wiki/John_Christie_(murderer)": "John Reginald Halliday Christie ( 8 April 1899 - 15 July 1953 ) , known to his family and friends as Reg Christie , was an English serial killer and necrophile from Halifax , who was active during the 1940s and early 1950s . He murdered at least eight people - including his wife , Ethel - by strangling them in his flat at 10 Rillington Place , Notting Hill , London . Christie moved out of Rillington Place during March 1953 ; soon afterward the bodies of three of his victims were discovered hidden in a wallpaper-covered alcove in the kitchen . Two further bodies were discovered in the garden , and his wife 's body was found beneath the floorboards of the front room . Christie was arrested and convicted of his wife 's murder , for which he was hanged . Two of Christie 's victims were Beryl Evans and her baby daughter Geraldine , who , along with Beryl 's husband , Timothy Evans , were tenants at 10 Rillington Place during 1948-49 . This case sparked huge controversy after Evans was charged with both murders , found guilty of the murder of his daughter and hanged in 1950 . Christie was a major prosecution witness ; when his own crimes were discovered three years later , serious doubts were raised about the integrity of Evans ' conviction . Christie himself subsequently admitted killing Beryl , but not Geraldine ; it is now generally accepted that Christie murdered both Beryl and Geraldine and that police mishandling of the original inquiry , as well as their incompetence during searches at the house , allowed Christie to escape detection and enabled him to murder four more women . The High Court , when overturning the conviction in the Evans case during the 2000s , accepted that Evans did not murder either his wife or his child , and that a miscarriage of justice therefore occurred when he was hanged .",

Historically part of Lanarkshire , the city now forms the Glasgow City council area , one of the 32 council areas of Scotland ; the local authority is Glasgow City Council . Glasgow is situated on the River Clyde in the country 's West Central Lowlands . It is the fifth most visited city in the UK . Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians or , informally , as Weegies . Glasgow is also known for the Glasgow patter , a distinct dialect of the Scots language that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city . Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland , and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain . Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh , and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the fifteenth century , it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the eighteenth century . From the eighteenth century onwards , the city also grew as one of Great Britain 's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies . With the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world 's pre-eminent centres of chemicals , textiles and engineering ; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry , which produced many innovative and famous vessels . Glasgow was the Second City of the British Empire for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period , although many cities argue the title was theirs . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Glasgow 's population grew rapidly , reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938 .",

The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England .

  "/wiki/Serial_killer": "A serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people , usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification , with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant period of time between them . Different authorities apply different criteria when designating serial killers . For example , while most authorities set a threshold of three murders , others extend it to four or lessen it to two . The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines serial killing as a series of two or more murders , committed as separate events , usually , but not always , by one offender acting alone . Although psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing , and most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim , the FBI states that the motives of serial killers can include anger , thrill-seeking , financial gain , and attention seeking . The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion . The victims may have something in common , for example , demographic profile , appearance , gender or race .

The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills ) .",

Sutcliffe had allegedly regularly used the services of prostitutes in Leeds and Bradford . He carried out murders over five years , including women who were not prostitutes . After his arrest in Sheffield by South Yorkshire Police for driving with false number plates in January 1981 , he was transferred to West Yorkshire Police , who questioned him about the killings . He confessed to being the perpetrator , saying that the voice of God had sent him on a mission to kill prostitutes . At his trial , Sutcliffe pleaded not guilty to murder on grounds of diminished responsibility , but he was convicted of murder on a majority verdict . Following his conviction , Sutcliffe began using his mother 's maiden name of Coonan . West Yorkshire Police were criticised for their failure to catch Sutcliffe despite having interviewed him nine times in the course of their five-year investigation .",

  "/wiki/Child_molestation": "Child sexual abuse , also called child molestation , is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent uses a child for sexual stimulation . Forms of child sexual abuse include engaging in sexual activities with a child ( whether by asking or pressuring , or by other means ) , indecent exposure ( of the genitals , female nipples , etc . ) , child grooming , child sexual exploitation or using a child to produce child pornography . Child sexual abuse can occur in a variety of settings , including home , school , or work ( in places where child labor is common ) . Child marriage is one of the main forms of child sexual abuse ; UNICEF has stated that child marriage represents perhaps the most prevalent form of sexual abuse and exploitation of girls . The effects of child sexual abuse can include depression , post-traumatic stress disorder , anxiety , complex post-traumatic stress disorder , propensity to further victimization in adulthood , and physical injury to the child , among other problems . Sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest and can result in more serious and long-term psychological trauma , especially in the case of parental incest . The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males . Most sexual abuse offenders are acquainted with their victims ; approximately 30% are relatives of the child , most often brothers , fathers , uncles , or cousins ; around 60% are other acquaintances , such as friends of the family , babysitters , or neighbors ; strangers are the offenders in approximately 10% of child sexual abuse cases . Most child sexual abuse is committed by men ; studies on female child molesters show that women commit 14% to 40% of offenses reported against boys and 6% of offenses reported against girls . The word pedophile is commonly applied indiscriminately to anyone who sexually abuses a child , but child sexual offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a strong sexual interest in prepubescent children . Under the law , child sexual abuse is often used as an umbrella term describing criminal and civil offenses in which an adult engages in sexual activity with a minor or exploits a minor for the purpose of sexual gratification .",
  "/wiki/Kidnapping": "In criminal law , kidnapping is the unlawful transportation , asportation and confinement of a person against their will . Thus , it is a composite crime . It can also be defined as false imprisonment by means of abduction , both of which are separate crimes that when committed simultaneously upon the same person merge as the single crime of kidnapping . The asportation/abduction element is typically but not necessarily conducted by means of force or fear . That is , the perpetrator may use a weapon to force the victim into a vehicle , but it is still kidnapping if the victim is enticed to enter the vehicle willingly , e.g. , in the belief it is a taxicab . Kidnapping may be done to demand for ransom in exchange for releasing the victim , or for other illegal purposes . Kidnapping can be accompanied by bodily injury which elevates the crime to aggravated kidnapping . Kidnapping of a child is also known as child abduction , and these are sometimes separate legal categories .",
  "/wiki/Rape": "Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person 's consent . The act may be carried out by physical force , coercion , abuse of authority , or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent , such as one who is unconscious , incapacitated , has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent . The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault . The rate of reporting , prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions . Internationally , the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged , per 100,000 people , from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median . Worldwide , rape is primarily committed by males against females . Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows , and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape . Widespread and systematic rape ( e.g. , war rape ) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict . These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes . Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a targeted ethnic group . People who have been raped can be traumatized and develop posttraumatic stress disorder . Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections .",
  "/wiki/Murder": "Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought .

Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent , recklessness . Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime , and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence ; and in a few , the death penalty may be imposed .",

  "/wiki/Peterborough": "Peterborough ( /\u02c8pi\u02d0t\u0259rb\u0259r\u0259 , -\u02ccb\u028cr\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is a cathedral city in Cambridgeshire , England , with a population of 202,110 in 2017 . Historically part of Northamptonshire , it is 76 miles ( 122 km ) north of London , on the River Nene which flows into the North Sea 30 miles ( 48 km ) to the north-east . The railway station is an important stop on the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh . The city is also 70 miles ( 110 km ) east of Birmingham , 38 miles ( 61 km ) east of Leicester , 81 miles ( 130 km ) south of Kingston upon Hull and 65 miles ( 105 km ) west of Norwich . The local topography is flat , and in some places the land lies below sea level , for example in parts of the Fens to the east of Peterborough . Human settlement in the area began before the Bronze Age , as can be seen at the Flag Fen archaeological site to the east of the current city centre , also with evidence of Roman occupation . The Anglo-Saxon period saw the establishment of a monastery , Medeshamstede , which later became Peterborough Cathedral . The population grew rapidly after the railways arrived in the 19th century , and Peterborough became an industrial centre , particularly known for its brick manufacture . After the Second World War , growth was limited until designation as a New Town in the 1960s . Housing and population are expanding and a \u00a31 billion regeneration of the city centre and immediately surrounding area is under way . Industrial employment has fallen since then , a significant proportion of new jobs being in financial services and distribution .",
  "/wiki/Cambridgeshire": "Cambridgeshire ( abbreviated Cambs . ) [ note 1 ] is a county in the East of England , bordering Lincolnshire to the north , Norfolk to the north-east , Suffolk to the east , Essex and Hertfordshire to the south , and Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire to the west . The city of Cambridge is the county town . Modern Cambridgeshire was formed in 1974 as an amalgamation of the counties of Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely and Huntingdon and Peterborough , the former covering the historic county of Cambridgeshire ( including the Isle of Ely ) and the latter covering the historic county of Huntingdonshire and the Soke of Peterborough , historically part of Northamptonshire . It contains most of the region known as Silicon Fen . Local government is divided between Cambridgeshire County Council and Peterborough City Council , which , since 1998 , forms a separate unitary authority . Under the county council , there are five district councils , Cambridge City Council , South Cambridgeshire District Council , East Cambridgeshire District Council , Huntingdonshire District Council and Fenland District Council .",
  "/wiki/Whole_life_order": "In England and Wales , life imprisonment is a sentence which lasts until the death of the prisoner , although in most cases the prisoner will be eligible for parole ( officially termed early release ) after a fixed period set by the judge . This period is known as the minimum term ( previously known as the whole life tariff ) , usually a few years . In some exceptionally grave cases , however , a judge may order that a life sentence should mean life by making a whole life order . Murder has carried a mandatory life sentence in England and Wales since capital punishment was suspended in 1965 . There is currently no first degree or second degree definition . However , there were two degrees of murder between 1957 and 1965 , one carrying the death penalty and one life imprisonment . Life imprisonment is only applicable to defendants aged 21 or over . Those aged between 18 and 20 are sentenced to custody for life . Those aged under 18 are sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure for murder , or detention for life for other crimes where life imprisonment is the sentence for adults ; however , regardless of age all defendants including those under 18 sentenced to a life sentence can theoretically be held in custody for their whole life if required and a life sentence can only end if quashed by a judge or the person serving the sentence dies . In addition to the sentences mentioned above , until 2012 there were two other kinds of life sentence , imprisonment for public protection ( for those over 18 ) and detention for public protection ( for those under 18 ) . These were for defendants whose crimes were not serious enough to merit a normal life sentence , but who were considered a danger to the public and so should not be released until the Parole Board had decided that they no longer represented a risk . These sentences were abolished by the Legal Aid , Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 , although a number of prisoners remain imprisoned under the former legislation ."
