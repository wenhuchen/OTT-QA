He picked up a bronze medal in the welterweight at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima , and also competed in two editions of the Olympic Games ( 1992 and 2004 ) under different banners . Nourian 's career had been overshadowed by a doping controversy in 2000 , resulting to a ban from the Iranian boxing team at the Summer Olympics in Sydney and his emigration to Australia , where he later obtained a dual citizenship . Nourian made his official debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona , where he ousted his opening match to Italy 's Michele Piccirillo in men 's light welterweight division ( 63.5 kg ) , receiving a default score 5-23 . Two years later , Nourian came powerful with a bronze medal on his semifinal match 17-26 against Thailand 's Arkhom Chenglai in the welterweight category ( 70 kg ) at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima , Japan . At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney , Nourian sought his sights to compete for the Iranian team in the light welterweight division ( 63.5 kg ) . On 17 September 2000 , the International Amateur Boxing Association banned him from the Games after he was tested positive for the steroid nandrolone , permitting his opponent Ajose Olusegun of Nigeria to walk over with an effortless victory in the first round . As a result , Nourian left the Iranian boxing squad shortly to move to Sydney , Australia , and later became a naturalized citizen in February 2004 . Pursuing his sporting career outside of Iran , Nourian trained under the boxing squad for the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra . Twelve years after his Olympic debut , Nourian qualified for his newly joined Australian squad , as a 32-year-old veteran , in the men 's light welterweight division ( 63.5 kg ) at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens . Earlier in the process , he guaranteed a spot on the nation 's boxing team after finishing first from the AIBA Oceania Qualification Tournament in Tonga . Unlike his two previous Games , Nourian scored a convincing victory 22-51 over Seychelles ' Kitson Julie in the opening round , before losing out his next match to Italy 's Michele di Rocco with a decisive 25-33 count ."
