  "/wiki/Hagerstown,_Maryland": "Hagerstown /\u02c8he\u026a\u0261\u0259rzta\u028an/ is a city in Washington County , Maryland , United States . It is the county seat of Washington County . The population of Hagerstown city proper at the 2010 census was 39,662 , and the population of the Hagerstown-Martinsburg Metropolitan Area ( extending into West Virginia ) was 269,140 . Hagerstown ranks as Maryland 's sixth-largest incorporated city . Hagerstown has a distinct topography , formed by stone ridges running from northeast to southwest through the center of town . Geography accordingly bounds its neighborhoods . These ridges consist of upper Stonehenge limestone . Many of the older buildings were built from this stone , which is easily quarried and dressed onsite . It whitens in weathering and the edgewise conglomerate and wavy laminae become distinctly visible , giving a handsome and uniquely Cumberland Valley appearance . Several of Hagerstowns churches are constructed of Stonehenge limestone and its value and beauty as building rock may be seen particularly in St. Johns Episcopal Church on West Antietam Street and the Presbyterian Church at the corner of Washington and Prospect Streets . Brick and concrete eventually displaced this native stone in the construction process . Hagerstown anchors the Hagerstown-Martinsburg , MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area , which lies just northwest of the Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia , DC-MD-VA-WV Combined Statistical Area in the heart of the Great Appalachian Valley ."
