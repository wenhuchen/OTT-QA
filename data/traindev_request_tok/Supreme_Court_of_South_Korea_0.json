  "/wiki/Chief_Justice": "The chief justice is the presiding member of a supreme court in any of many countries with a justice system based on English common law , such as the Supreme Court of Bangladesh , the Supreme Court of Canada , the Supreme Court of Singapore , the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong , the Supreme Court of Japan , the Supreme Court of India , the Supreme Court of Pakistan , the Supreme Court of Nigeria , the Supreme Court of Nepal , the Constitutional Court of South Africa , the Supreme Court of Ireland , the Supreme Court of New Zealand , the High Court of Australia , the Supreme Court of the United States , and provincial or state supreme courts/high courts . The situation is slightly different in the three legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom . The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales ; in Northern Ireland 's courts , the equivalent position is the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland , and in the courts of Scotland the head of the judiciary of Scotland is the Lord President of the Court of Session , who is also Lord Justice General of Scotland . These three judges are not , though , part of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom , which operates across all three jurisdictions and is headed by the President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom . The chief justice can be selected in many ways , but , in many nations , the position is given to the most senior justice of the court , while , in the United States , it is often the President 's most important political nomination , subject to approval by the United States Senate . Although the title of this top American jurist is , by statute , Chief Justice of the United States , the term Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is often used unofficially . In some courts , the chief justice has a different title , e.g . president of the supreme court . In other courts , the title of chief justice is used , but the court has a different name , e.g . the Supreme Court of Judicature in colonial ( British ) Ceylon , and the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia ( in the US state of West Virginia ) .",
