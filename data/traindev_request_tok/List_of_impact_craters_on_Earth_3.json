Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub , after which the crater is named . It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometers ( 6.8 to 50.3 miles ) in diameter , the Chicxulub impactor , striking the Earth . The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary ( commonly known as the K-Pg boundary ) , slightly less than 66 million years ago , and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event , a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct , including all non-avian dinosaurs . The crater is estimated to be 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ) in diameter and 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) in depth , well into the continental crust of the region of about 10-30 kilometers ( 6.2-18.6 miles ) depth . It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth , and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research . The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield , geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula during the late 1970s . Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search . Later , through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990 , Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature . Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz , a gravity anomaly , and tektites in surrounding areas . In 2016 , a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater , hundreds of meters below the current sea floor , to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself . The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects .",

  "/wiki/Popigai_crater": "The Popigai crater ( or astrobleme ) in Siberia , Russia , is tied with the Manicouagan Crater as the fourth largest verified impact crater on Earth . A large bolide impact created the 100-kilometre ( 62 mi ) diameter crater approximately 35 million years ago during the late Eocene epoch ( Priabonian stage ) . It might be linked to the Eocene-Oligocene extinction event . The crater is 300 km ( 190 mi ) east from the outpost of Khatanga and 880 km ( 550 mi ) northeast of the city of Norilsk , NNE of the Anabar Plateau . It is designated by UNESCO as a Geopark , a site of special geological heritage . There is a small possibility that the Popigai impact crater may have formed simultaneously with the approximately 35-million-year-old Chesapeake Bay and Toms Canyon impact craters . For decades the Popigai crater has fascinated paleontologists and geologists , but the entire area was completely off limits because of the diamonds found there . However , a major investigatory expedition was undertaken in 1997 , which greatly advanced understanding of the enigmatic structure . The impactor in this event has been identified as either an 8 km ( 5.0 mi ) diameter chondrite asteroid , or a 5 km ( 3.1 mi ) diameter stony asteroid . The shock pressures from the impact instantaneously transformed graphite in the ground into diamonds within a 13.6 km ( 8.5 mi ) radius of the impact point . These diamonds are usually 0.5 to 2 mm ( 0.020 to 0.079 in ) in diameter , though a few exceptional specimens are 10 mm ( 0.39 in ) in size . The diamonds not only inherited the tabular shape of the original graphite grains but they additionally preserved the original crystals ' delicate striations .",

  "/wiki/Acraman_crater": "Acraman crater is a deeply eroded impact crater in the Gawler Ranges of South Australia . Its location is marked by Lake Acraman , a circular ephemeral playa lake about 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) in diameter . The discovery of the crater and independent discovery of its ejecta were first reported in the journal Science in 1986 . The evidence for impact includes the presence of shatter cones and shocked quartz in shattered bedrock on islands within Lake Acraman . The crater is deeply eroded and its original size must be inferred by indirect means . Some authors estimate an original diameter of up to 85 to 90 kilometres ( 53 to 56 mi ) , while other suggest a smaller size , perhaps only 35 to 40 kilometres ( 22 to 25 mi ) , closer to that of the depression in which Lake Acraman is centred .

Nova Scotia 's capital and largest city is Halifax , which is today home to about 45 per cent of the province 's population , is the thirteenth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada , the largest city in Atlantic Canada , and Canadas second largest coastal city ( after Vancouver ) .",
  "/wiki/Araguainha_crater": "The Araguainha crater or Araguainha dome is an impact crater on the border of Mato Grosso and Goi\u00e1s states , Brazil , between the villages of Araguainha and Ponte Branca . With a diameter of 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) , it is the largest known impact crater in South America . The crater has most recently been dated to 254.7 \u00b1 2.5 million years ago , when the region was probably a shallow sea . The margins of error of this date overlap the time of the Permian-Triassic extinction event , one of the largest mass extinction events in Earth 's history . The impact punched through Paleozoic sedimentary units belonging to the Paran\u00e1 Basin formations , and exposed the underlying Ordovician granite basement rocks . It is estimated that the crater was initially 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) wide and 2.4 kilometres ( 1.5 mi ) deep , which then widened to 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) as its walls subsided inwards .",

At 8.5 million square kilometers ( 3.2 million square miles ) and with over 211 million people , Brazil is the world 's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous . Its capital is Bras\u00edlia , and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo . The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states , the Federal District , and the 5,570 municipalities . It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas ; it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations , due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world . Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east , Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers ( 4,655 mi ) . It borders all other countries in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent 's land area . Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro . In 1815 , the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves .",

  "/wiki/Virginia": "Virginia ( /v\u0259r\u02c8d\u0292\u026ani\u0259/ ( listen ) ) , officially the Commonwealth of Virginia , is a state in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States located between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains . The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay , which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna . The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond ; Virginia Beach is the most populous city , and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision . The Commonwealth 's estimated population as of 2018 [ update ] is over 8.5 million . The area 's history begins with several indigenous groups , including the Powhatan . In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World . Virginia 's state nickname , the Old Dominion , is a reference to this status . Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony 's early politics and plantation economy . Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution . In the American Civil War , Virginia 's Secession Convention resolved to join the Confederacy , and Virginia 's First Wheeling Convention resolved to remain in the Union ; that led to the creation of West Virginia . Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction , both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia . The Virginia General Assembly is the oldest continuous law-making body in the New World .",

Known among Russians in the Middle Ages as the Murman Sea ( Norwegian Sea ) , the current name of the sea is after the historical Dutch navigator Willem Barentsz . This is a rather shallow shelf sea , with an average depth of 230 metres ( 750 ft ) , and it is an important site for both fishing and hydrocarbon exploration . The Barents Sea is bordered by the Kola Peninsula to the south , the shelf edge towards the Norwegian Sea to the west , and the archipelagos of Svalbard to the northwest , Franz Josef Land to the northeast and Novaya Zemlya to the east . The islands of Novaya Zemlya , an extension of the northern end of the Ural Mountains , separate the Barents Sea from the Kara Sea . Although part of the Arctic Ocean , the Barents Sea has been characterised as turning into the Atlantic because of its status as the Arctic warming hot spot . Hydrologic changes due to global warming have led to a reduction in sea ice and in stratification of the water column , which could produce major changes in weather in Eurasia .",

  "/wiki/Manitoba": "Manitoba ( /\u02ccm\u00e6n\u026a\u02c8to\u028ab\u0259/ ( listen ) ) is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada . It is often considered one of the three prairie provinces ( with Alberta and Saskatchewan ) and is Canada 's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.369 million people . Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres ( 250,900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape , stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived on two major river systems , what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system . A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson 's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert 's Land . During the next 200 years , communities continued to grow and evolve , with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg . The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba . There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province . Manitoba 's capital and largest city , Winnipeg , is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada .",

  "/wiki/Western_Australia": "Western Australia [ a ] ( abbreviated as WA ) is a state occupying the entire western third of Australia . It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the north and west , and the Southern Ocean to the south , [ b ] the Northern Territory to the north-east , and South Australia to the south-east . Western Australia is Australia 's largest state , with a total land area of 2,529,875 square kilometres ( 976,790 sq mi ) , and the second-largest country subdivision in the world , surpassed only by Russia 's Sakha Republic . The state has about 2.6 million inhabitants - around 11 percent of the national total - of whom the vast majority ( 92 per cent ) live in the south-west corner , 79 per cent of the population living in the Perth area , leaving the remainder of the state sparsely populated . The first European visitor to Western Australia was the Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog , who visited the Western Australian coast in 1616 . The first European settlement of Western Australia occurred following the landing by Major Edmund Lockyer on 26 December 1826 of an expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial government . He established a convict-supported military garrison at King George III Sound , at present-day Albany , and on 21 January 1827 formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown . This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829 , including the site of the present-day capital , Perth . York was the first inland settlement in Western Australia . Situated 97 kilometres ( 60 miles ) east of Perth , it was settled on 16 September 1831 . Western Australia achieved responsible government in 1890 and federated with the other British colonies in Australia in 1901 . Today , its economy mainly relies on mining , oil and gas , services and construction ."
