  "/wiki/NY_30": "New York State Route 30 ( NY 30 ) is a state highway in the central part of New York in the United States . It extends for 300.71 miles ( 483.95 km ) from an interchange with NY 17 ( Future Interstate 86 ) in the Southern Tier to the US-Canada border in the state 's North Country , where it continues into Quebec as Route 138 . On a regional level , the route serves to connect the Catskill Park to the Adirondack Park . In the latter , NY 30 is known as the Adirondack Trail . Aside from the state parks , the route serves the city of Amsterdam ( where it meets the New York State Thruway ) and several villages . NY 30 was assigned in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to most of its modern routing south of Wells , replacing a series of designations that had been assigned to the highway in the 1920s . The portion of what is now NY 30 north of Speculator was initially part of NY 10 . When that route was truncated to Arietta c. 1960 , NY 30 was extended northward over NY 10 's former alignment by way of an overlap with NY 8 .",

  "/wiki/NY_5S": "New York State Route 5S ( NY 5S ) is an east-west state highway located in the Mohawk Valley of New York in the United States .

The route runs along the south side of the Mohawk River for its entire length and parallels NY 5 , which runs along the north side of the Mohawk River ( hence the S in the route number of NY 5S ) . In some locations , NY 5S has been upgraded into a super two or an expressway , mostly in Utica and western Herkimer County . The route is part of New York State Bicycle Route 5 west of its junction with NY 103 in Schenectady County . When NY 5S was assigned in 1930 , the route stretched from Oneida in the west to Schenectady in the east . It was later truncated on both ends to eliminate overlaps with other state routes and to accommodate the construction of other roadways , most notably Interstate 890 ( I-890 ) in western Schenectady .",
