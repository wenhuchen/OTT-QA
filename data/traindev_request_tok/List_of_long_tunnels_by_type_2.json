It is operated by the state-owned Guangzhou Metro Corporation and was the fourth metro system to be built in mainland China , after those of Beijing , Tianjin and Shanghai . The earliest efforts to build an underground rapid transit system in Guangzhou date back to 1960 . In the two decades that followed , the project was brought into the agenda five times , but ended up abandoned each time due to financial and technical difficulties . Preparation of what would lead to today 's Guangzhou Metro did not start until the 1980s , and it was not until 1993 that construction of the first line , Line 1 , officially began .

  "/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)": "The Mass Rapid Transit , abbreviated and referred to in local parlance as the MRT , is a heavy rail rapid transit system that constitutes the bulk of the railway network in Singapore , spanning - with the exception of the forested core and the island 's rural northwest - the length and width of the city-state 's main island . [ note 1 ] The first section of the MRT opened on 7 November 1987 , and the network has since grown rapidly in accordance with Singapore 's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the backbone of the country 's public transportation system , with an average daily ridership of 3.384 million in 2019 , [ note 2 ] approximately 83% of the bus network 's 4.099 million in the same period . Singapore 's MRT infrastructure is built , operated , and managed in accordance with a hybridised quasi-nationalised regulatory framework called the New Rail Financing Framework ( NRFF ) , in which the lines are constructed and the assets owned by the Land Transport Authority , a statutory board of the Government of Singapore . The Land Transport Authority allocates operating concessions to two for-profit private corporations , namely SMRT and SBS Transit , both of which are responsible for asset maintenance on their respective lines . These operators also run bus and taxi services , thus facilitating the full integration of public transport services . As of January 2020 , the MRT network encompasses 203 kilometres ( 126 mi ) of route on standard gauge , with 122 stations in operation , spread across six lines set in a circle-radial topology . The network is expected to double to a total length of almost 400 kilometres ( 250 mi ) by 2040 as a result of ongoing expansion works to its six existing lines and the construction of three new lines . The network is complemented by a small number of local Light Rail Transit ( LRT ) networks in the suburban towns of Bukit Panjang , Sengkang , and Punggol that link MRT stations with HDB public housing estates , bringing the combined length of the domestic heavy and light rail network to 231.6 kilometres ( 143.9 mi ) , with a total of 159 stations in operation . [ note 3 ] The MRT is the oldest , busiest , and most comprehensive rapid transit system ( both by length and number of stations ) in Southeast Asia . [ note 4 ] More than S $ 85 billion ( US $ 63 billion ) has been spent on the construction of all currently operational lines in the network , the procurement of rolling stock and other rail assets , and the periodical renewal of assets , making the MRT one of the costliest rapid transit networks and public transportation projects in the world on both a per-kilometre and absolute basis . [ note 5 ] The system has the added distinctions of having the longest fully automated and driverless network in the world , as well as some of the longest and deepest subway tunnel sections in the world . The MRT is also unique in that the vast majority of underground stations in the network double as purpose-built Singapore Civil Defence Force bunkers and air raid shelters , being built with hardened boundary walls , reinforced concrete floor and roof slabs , and concrete or steel doors for the purpose of withstanding conventional aerial bomb and chemical attacks .",

The system is the 12th longest rapid transit system in the world , with a total length of 293 km ( 182 mi ) . Its growth between 1995 and 2007 put it among the fastest growing networks in the world at the time , rivaling many Asian metros such as the Shanghai Metro , Guangzhou Metro , Beijing Subway , and Delhi Metro . However , the European debt crisis greatly slowed expansion plans , with many projects being postponed and canceled . Unlike normal Spanish road and rail traffic , which drive on the right , Madrid Metro trains use left-hand running on all lines because traffic in Madrid drove on the left until 1924 , five years after the system started operating . Trains are in circulation every day from 6:00 am until 1:30 am , though during the weekends , this schedule is to be extended by one more hour in the morning in 2020 . Furthermore , the regional government intends to keep stations opened around the clock during these days from 2023 onwards .

  "/wiki/Toei_Oedo_Line": "The \u014cedo Line is the first Tokyo subway line to use linear motor propulsion ( and the second in Japan after the Osaka Metro Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line ) , which allows it to use smaller cars and smaller tunnels ( a benefit similarly achieved by the Advanced Rapid Transit system manufactured by Bombardier ) . This technology , though , is incompatible with other railway and subway lines , which can only operate with vehicles utilizing conventional rotary motors , thus preventing \u014cedo Line trains from operating through services onto them . Although vehicles with rotary motor propulsion can technically operate on the \u014cedo Line , its smaller tunnels and loading gauge prevents such occurrences , hence making the \u014cedo Line the first self-enclosed subway line in Tokyo in over 40 years , and the first such line operated by Toei . The line is deep ( as low as 48 meters below ground at points ) through central Tokyo , including three underground crossings of the Sumida River . Originally budgeted at \u00a5682.6 billion and 6 years , the construction ended up taking nearly 10 years and estimates of the final cost of construction range from the official \u00a5988.6 billion to over \u00a51,400 billion yen , making it the most expensive subway line ever built . ( Yokohama 's Minato Mirai Line , however , was even costlier if measured per kilometer . ) Ridership projections originally estimated 1 million users daily , a figure scaled down to 820,000 before opening . At the end of 2006 , the line was averaging 720,000 passengers/day . However , its ridership has increased by about five percent each year since its opening , following new commercial and residential development around major stations such as Roppongi and Shiodome .
