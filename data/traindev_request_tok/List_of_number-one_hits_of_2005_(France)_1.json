Madonna is often cited as an influence by other artists . Born and raised in Michigan , Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance . After performing as a drummer , guitarist , and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy , Madonna signed with Sire Records in 1982 and released her eponymous debut album the next year .

  "/wiki/Confessions_on_a_Dancefloor": "Confessions on a Dance Floor is the tenth studio album by American singer and songwriter Madonna . It was released on November 15 , 2005 , by Warner Bros. Records . A complete departure from her previous studio album American Life ( 2003 ) , the album includes influences of 1970s and 1980s disco , as well as modern-day club music . Initially , she began working with Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef for the album but later felt that their collaboration was not going in the direction she desired . Madonna took her collaboration with Stuart Price who was overviewing her documentary I 'm Going to Tell You a Secret . The album was mainly recorded at Price 's home-studio where Madonna spent most of her time during the recordings . Musically , the album is structured like a DJ 's set . The songs are sequenced and blended so that they are played continuously without any gaps . The title arrived from the fact that the album tracklisting consists of light-hearted and happy songs in the beginning , and progresses to much darker melodies and lyrics describing personal feelings and commitments . Songs on the album sample and reference the music of other dance-oriented artists like ABBA , Donna Summer , Pet Shop Boys , the Bee Gees and Depeche Mode , as well as Madonna 's 1980s output . Madonna promoted the album through several live performances and a promotional tour . She embarked on the Confessions Tour in 2006 , which became the highest-grossing tour ever for a female artist at that time .",
