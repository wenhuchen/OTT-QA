  "/wiki/Mockumentary": "A mockumentary ( a portmanteau of mock and documentary ) or docucomedy is a type of movie or television show depicting fictional events but presented as a documentary . These productions are often used to analyze or comment on current events and issues by using a fictional setting , or to parody the documentary form itself . While mockumentaries are usually comedic , pseudo-documentaries are their dramatic equivalents . However , pseudo-documentary should not be confused with docudrama , a fictional genre in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events . Also , docudrama is different from docufiction ; a genre in which documentaries are contaminated with fictional elements . Mockumentaries are often presented as historical documentaries , with B roll and talking heads discussing past events , or as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pieces following people as they go through various events . Examples emerged during the 1950s when archival film footage became available . A very early example was a short piece on the Swiss Spaghetti Harvest that appeared as an April Fools ' prank on the British television program Panorama in 1957 . The term mockumentary , which originated in the 1960s , was popularized in the mid-1980s when This Is Spinal Tap director Rob Reiner used it in interviews to describe that film . Mockumentaries are often partly or wholly improvised , as an unscripted style of acting helps to maintain the pretense of reality . Comedic mockumentaries rarely have laugh tracks , also to sustain the atmosphere , although exceptions exist . Music is often employed to expose the ambiguities and fallacies of conventional storytelling ; for instance by pointing at the paradoxes of the distinction between diegetic and extradiegetic music .",

The development of samizdat , opposition demonstrations held in Moscow such as the 1965 Glasnost meeting and 1968 Red Square demonstration , and the harsh repressions unleashed by Soviet authorities against dissenters including forced psychiatric treatment , prison camps and deportations , are all part of the film 's narrative . The third episode deals with events leading to the collapse of Soviet dictatorship and the democratic revolution of August 1991 . The final episode is dedicated to the period after 1991 ; in it former dissidents discuss why the emergence of democracy in Russia proved to be short-lived , and how it was possible that a former KGB officer , Vladimir Putin , was elected to the Russian presidency . They Chose Freedom is narrated primarily through the interviews of dissidents themselves . The film 's participants are Vladimir Bukovsky , Elena Bonner , Sergei Kovalev , Alexander Yessenin-Volpin , Anatoly Sharansky , Yuri Fyodorovich Orlov , Alexander Podrabinek , Eduard Kuznetsov , Pavel Litvinov , Naum Korzhavin , Natalya Gorbanevskaya , Viktor Fainberg and Vladimir Dremlyuga .
