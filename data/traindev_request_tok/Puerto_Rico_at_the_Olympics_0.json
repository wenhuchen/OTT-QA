The 1940 Olympic Games had been scheduled for Tokyo , and then for Helsinki ; the 1944 Olympic Games had been provisionally planned for London . This was the second occasion that London had hosted the Olympic Games , having previously hosted them in 1908 , forty years earlier . The Olympics would again return to London 64 years later in 2012 , making London the first city to have hosted the games three times , and the only such city until Paris and Los Angeles host their third games in 2024 and 2028 , respectively . The 1948 Olympic Games were the first of two summer Olympic Games held under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edstr\u00f6m . The event came to be known as the Austerity Games , because of the difficult economic climate and rationing imposed in the aftermath of World War II . No new venues were built for the games ( with events taking place mainly at Empire Stadium and the Empire Pool at Wembley Park ) , and athletes were housed in existing accommodation at the Wembley area instead of an Olympic Village , as were the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games and the subsequent 1952 Games in Helsinki . A record 59 nations were represented by 4,104 athletes , 3,714 men and 390 women , in 19 sport disciplines . Germany and Japan were not invited to participate in the games ; the Soviet Union was invited but chose not to send any athletes , sending observers instead to prepare for the 1952 Olympics . One of the star performers at the Games was Dutch sprinter Fanny Blankers-Koen . Dubbed The Flying Housewife , the thirty-year-old mother of two won four gold medals in athletics .",

While US athletes typically turned pro after the Olympics , while still in their early twenties , Cubans and the Soviets were not allowed to do so and stayed on in the amateurs , participating in multiple Olympic cycles . Journalist George Vecsey remarked after the conclusion of the games that Despite all the flag-waving euphoria in the United States over all those medals in Los Angeles , the Summer Games were a made-in-Disneyland reproduction of the Games because there were no Soviet runners , no Cuban boxers , no East German swimmers .
