This level was once called the University Division of the NCAA , in contrast to the lower level College Division ; these terms were replaced with numeric divisions in 1973 . The University Division was renamed Division I , while the College Division was split in two ; the College Division members that offered scholarships or wanted to compete against those who did became Division II , while those who did not want to offer scholarships became Division III . For college football only , D-I schools are further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and those institutions that do not have any football program . FBS teams have higher game attendance requirements and more players receiving athletic scholarships than FCS teams . The FBS is named for its series of postseason bowl games , with various polls ranking teams after the conclusion of these games , while the FCS national champion is determined by a multi-team bracket tournament . For the 2014-15 school year , Division I contained 345 of the NCAA 's 1,066 member institutions , with 125 in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , 125 in the Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) , and 95 non-football schools , with six additional schools in the transition from Division II to Division I .

A twelfth team , Macarthur FC , based in Sydney , is scheduled to join the league in the 2020-21 season . It has been officially known since its inception as the Hyundai A-League through a series of sponsorship arrangements with the Hyundai Motor Company . Seasons run from October to May and include a 26-round regular season followed by a Finals Series playoff involving the highest-placed teams , culminating in a grand final match . The winner of the regular season tournament is dubbed the 'premier ' while the winner of the grand final is the season 's 'champion ' . This differs from the other major football codes in Australia , where 'premier ' refers to the winner of the grand final and the winner of the regular season is the 'minor premier ' . Successful A-League clubs gain qualification into the Asian continental club competition , the Asian Football Confederation Champions League ( ACL ) also known as AFC Champions League , in 2014 the Western Sydney Wanderers became the first and only winning Australian club . Similar to the United States and Canada 's Major League Soccer , as well as other professional sports leagues in Australia , Australia 's A-League does not practice promotion and relegation . Since the league 's inaugural season , a total of seven clubs have been crowned A-League Premiers and six clubs have been crowned A-League Champions .",

  "/wiki/James_Watt": "James Watt FRS FRSE ( /w\u0252t/ ; 30 January 1736 ( 19 January 1736 OS ) - 25 August 1819 ) was a Scottish inventor , mechanical engineer , and chemist who improved on Thomas Newcomen 's 1712 Newcomen steam engine with his Watt steam engine in 1776 , which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both his native Great Britain and the rest of the world . While working as an instrument maker at the University of Glasgow , Watt became interested in the technology of steam engines . He realised that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder . Watt introduced a design enhancement , the separate condenser , which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power , efficiency , and cost-effectiveness of steam engines . Eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion , greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water . Watt attempted to commercialise his invention , but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with Matthew Boulton in 1775 . The new firm of Boulton and Watt was eventually highly successful and Watt became a wealthy man . In his retirement , Watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work . He developed the concept of horsepower , and the SI unit of power , the watt , was named after him .",

  "/wiki/National_Football_League": "The National Football League ( NFL ) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams , divided equally between the National Football Conference ( NFC ) and the American Football Conference ( AFC ) . The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America and the highest professional level of American football in the world . The NFL 's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December , with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season , six teams from each conference ( four division winners and two wild card teams ) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC . The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season . After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings , a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966 . Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the American Football League ( AFL ) , the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970 . Today , the NFL has the highest average attendance ( 67,591 ) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States . The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world , with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen 's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015 .

  "/wiki/National_Football_League_Players_Association": "The National Football League Players Association , or NFLPA , is the labor organization representing the professional American football players in the National Football League ( NFL ) . The NFLPA , which has headquarters in Washington , D.C. , is led by president Eric Winston and executive director DeMaurice Smith . Founded in 1956 , the NFLPA is the second-oldest labor union of the four major professional sports leagues ; it was established to provide players with formal representation to negotiate compensation and the terms of a collective bargaining agreement ( CBA ) . The NFLPA is a member of the AFL-CIO , the largest federation of unions in the United States . In the early years of the NFL , contractual negotiations took place between individual players and management ; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining . A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union 's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners . League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation ; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA . However , the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968 , when a CBA was signed . The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011 . In addition to conducting labor negotiations , the NFLPA represents and protects the rights of the players ; the organization 's actions include filing grievances against player discipline that it deems too severe . The union also ensures that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement are adhered to by the league and the teams . It negotiates and monitors retirement and insurance benefits and enhances and defends the image of players and their profession .",
