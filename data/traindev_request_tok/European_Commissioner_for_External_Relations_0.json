  "/wiki/Flemish_Liberals_and_Democrats": "Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats ( Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten ) , commonly known as Open VLD or simply as the VLD , is a conservative-liberal Flemish political party in Belgium . The party was created in 1992 from the former Party for Freedom and Progress ( PVV ) and politicians from other parties . The party led the government for three cabinets under Guy Verhofstadt from 1999 until March 2008 .

Ideologically , Open VLD started as an economically liberal , somewhat Thatcherite party under its founder , Guy Verhofstadt . The VLD rapidly became more centrist and gave up much of its free market approach , partly under the influence of Verhofstadt 's political scientist brother Dirk Verhofstadt . Party chairman Bart Somers called in November 2006 for a revolution within the party , saying that a liberal party , like the VLD , can be only progressive and social . From 2000 to 2004 , during the second period of its participation in the Belgian federal government and under Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt , the VLD allegedly lost most of its ideological appeal . Several of its thinkers such as ( former member ) Boudewijn Bouckaert , president of Nova Civitas , heavily criticised the party . Many others resented the priority it placed on the 'Belgian compromise ' , which enabled the French Community 's Socialist Party to gain a dominant position in the formulation of Belgian federal government policy .",
