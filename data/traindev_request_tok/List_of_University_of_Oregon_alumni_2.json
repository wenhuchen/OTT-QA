The combination of the Macintosh 's graphical user interface , PageMaker publishing software , and the Apple LaserWriter laser printer marked the beginning of the desktop publishing revolution . Ported to PCs running Windows 1.0 in 1987 , PageMaker helped to popularize both the Macintosh platform and the Windows environment . A key component that led to PageMaker 's success was its native support for Adobe Systems ' PostScript page description language . After Adobe purchased the majority of Aldus ' assets ( including FreeHand , PressWise , PageMaker etc . ) in 1994 and subsequently phased out the Aldus name , version 6 was released . The program remained a major force in the high-end DTP market through the early 1990s , but new features were slow in coming . By the mid-1990s , it faced increasing competition from QuarkXPress on the Mac , and to a lesser degree , Ventura on the PC , and by the end of the decade it was no longer a major force . Quark proposed buying the product and cancelling it , but instead , in 1999 Adobe released their Quark Killer , Adobe InDesign .

  "/wiki/Desktop_publishing": "Desktop publishing ( DTP ) is the creation of documents using page layout software on a personal ( desktop ) computer . It was first used almost exclusively for print publications , but now it also assists in the creation of various forms of online content . Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic-quality text and images comparable to traditional typography and printing . Desktop publishing is also the main reference for digital typography . This technology allows individuals , businesses , and other organizations to self-publish a wide variety of content , from menus to magazines to books , without the expense of commercial printing . Desktop publishing often requires the use of a personal computer and WYSIWYG page layout software to create documents for either large-scale publishing or small-scale local multifunction peripheral output and distribution - although a non-WYSIWYG system such as LaTeX could also be used for the creation of highly-structured and technically-demanding documents as well . Desktop publishing methods provide more control over design , layout , and typography than word processing . However , word processing software has evolved to include most , if not all , capabilities previously available only with professional printing or desktop publishing . The same DTP skills and software used for common paper and book publishing are sometimes used to create graphics for point of sale displays , presentations , infographics , brochures , business cards , promotional items , trade show exhibits , retail package designs and outdoor signs . Although what is classified as DTP software is usually limited to print and PDF publications , DTP is n't limited to print . The content produced by desktop publishers may also be exported and used for electronic media . The job descriptions that include DTP , such as DTP artist , often require skills using software for producing e-books , web content , and web pages , which may involve web design or user interface design for any graphical user interface .",
