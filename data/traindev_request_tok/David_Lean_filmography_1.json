  "/wiki/A_Passage_to_India_(film)": "A Passage to India is a 1984 epic historical drama film written , directed and edited by David Lean . The screenplay is based on the play of the same name by Santha Rama Rau , which was in turn based on the 1924 novel of the same name by E.M. Forster . Set in the 1920s during the period of the British Raj , the film tells the story of the interactions of several characters in the fictional city of Chandrapore , namely Dr. Aziz , Mrs Moore , Adela Quested , and Richard Fielding . When newcomer to India Adela accuses Aziz of an attempted rape within the famed Marabar Caves , the city is split between the British elite and the native underclass as the budding friendship between Aziz and Fielding is tested . The film explores themes of racism , imperialism , religion , and the nature of relationships both friendly and marital . This was the final film of Lean 's prestigious career , and the first feature-film he had directed in fourteen years , since Ryan 's Daughter in 1970 . Receiving universal critical acclaim upon its release with many praising it as Lean 's finest since Lawrence of Arabia , A Passage to India received eleven nominations at the Academy Awards , including Best Picture , Best Director for Lean , and Best Actress for Judy Davis for her portrayal as Adela Quested . Peggy Ashcroft won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal as Mrs Moore , making her , at 77 , the oldest actress to win the award , and Maurice Jarre won his third Academy Award for Best Original Score .",
  "/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Film_Editing": "The Academy Award for Best Film Editing is one of the annual awards of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) . Nominations for this award are closely correlated with the Academy Award for Best Picture . For 33 consecutive years , 1981 to 2013 , every Best Picture winner had also been nominated for the Film Editing Oscar , and about two thirds of the Best Picture winners have also won for Film Editing . Only the principal , above the line editor ( s ) as listed in the film 's credits are named on the award ; additional editors , supervising editors , etc . are not currently eligible . The nominations for this Academy Award are determined by a ballot of the voting members of the Editing Branch of the Academy ; there were 220 members of the Editing Branch in 2012 . The members may vote for up to five of the eligible films in the order of their preference ; the five films with the largest vote totals are selected as nominees . The Academy Award itself is selected from the nominated films by a subsequent ballot of all active and life members of the Academy . This process is essentially the reverse of that of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts ( BAFTA ) ; nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Editing are done by a general ballot of Academy voters , and the winner is selected by members of the editing chapter .",
  "/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Adapted_Screenplay": "The Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay is one of the Academy Awards , also known as the Oscars . They are overwhelmingly considered by both entertainment industry insiders as well as the movie-going public to be the most prestigious film awards in the United States . The Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay is awarded each year to the writer of a screenplay adapted from another source ( as opposed to the Oscar for best original screenplay [ italics added ] , for which no additional works are cited by the author ( s ) as forming the basis for their screenplay , either in part or as a whole ) . The most frequently adapted media are long-form prose , aka novels ; but other adapted narrative formats include plays , musicals , and other theatrical works ; short stories ; TV series ; and even other films , for example , foreign language films . All sequels are automatically considered adaptations by this standard , since the sequel must be based on the story set forth in the original film . See also : the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay , a similar award for screenplays that are not adaptations . As of the 2020 ceremony , Taika Waititi is the most recent winner in this category for Jojo Rabbit .",

Until 1986 , it was known as the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film , meaning that any non-American film could be honoured . In 1987 , it was changed to Best Foreign Language Film , so that non-American English-language films are now considered for the Best Motion Picture awards . Additionally , this change makes American films primarily in another language eligible for this award , including winners like Letters from Iwo Jima and nominees Apocalypto , The Kite Runner , and In the Land of Blood and Honey . Note that since the 1987 change in the criteria for this award , its eligibility criteria have been considerably broader than those for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film ( known before 2020 as Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film } . American films have never been eligible for this award , and even non-U.S. films had to have principal dialogue in a native ( non-English ) language of the submitting country until 2006 . Before 1974 , the award was given only infrequently , and with several films being jointly honoured per year . The most honored country in this category is the United Kingdom , with seven films honored . The most honoured countries after 1987 are Spain and France .",
