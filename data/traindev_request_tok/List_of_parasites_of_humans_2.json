  "/wiki/Clonorchiasis": "Clonorchiasis is an infectious disease caused by the Chinese liver fluke , Clonorchis sinensis , and two related species . Clonorchiasis is a known risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma , a neoplasm of the biliary system . Symptoms of opisthorchiasis caused by Opisthorchis viverrini and by O. felineus are indistinguishable from clonorchiasis caused by Clonorchis sinensis , so the disease by these three parasites should be referred as clonorchiasis .",
  "/wiki/Clonorchis_sinensis": "Clonorchis sinensis , the Chinese liver fluke , is a liver fluke belonging to the class Trematoda , phylum Platyhelminthes . It infects fish-eating mammals including humans . In humans , it infects the common bile duct and gall bladder , feeding on bile . It was discovered by a British physician James McConnell at the Medical College Hospital in Calcutta ( Kolkata ) in 1874 . The first description was given by Thomas Spencer Cobbold , who named it Distoma sinense . The fluke passes its life cycle in three different hosts , namely freshwater snail as first intermediate hosts , freshwater fish as second intermediate host , and mammals as definitive hosts . Endemic to Asia and Russia , C. sinensis is the most prevalent human fluke in Asia and third-most in the world . It is still actively transmitted in Korea , China , Vietnam , and Russia . Most infection ( about 85% ) is in China . The infection , called clonorchiasis , generally appears as jaundice , indigestion , biliary inflammation , bile duct obstruction , even liver cirrhosis , cholangiocarcinoma , and hepatic carcinoma . As a major causative agent of bile duct cancer ( cholangiocarcinoma ) , the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified C. sinensis as a Group 1 biological carcinogen in 2009 .",

  "/wiki/Liver_fluke": "Liver fluke is a collective name of a polyphyletic group of parasitic trematodes under the phylum Platyhelminthes . They are principally parasites of the liver of various mammals , including humans . Capable of moving along the blood circulation , they can occur also in bile ducts , gallbladder , and liver parenchyma . In these organs , they produce pathological lesions leading to parasitic diseases . They have complex life cycles requiring two or three different hosts , with free-living larval stages in water .",
  "/wiki/Fasciolosis": "Fasciolosis is a parasitic worm infection caused by the common liver fluke Fasciola hepatica as well as by Fasciola gigantica . The disease is a plant-borne trematode zoonosis , and is classified as a neglected tropical disease ( NTD ) . It affects humans , but its main host is ruminants such as cattle and sheep . The disease progresses through four distinct phases ; an initial incubation phase of between a few days up to three months with little or no symptoms ; an invasive or acute phase which may manifest with : fever , malaise , abdominal pain , gastrointestinal symptoms , urticaria , anemia , jaundice , and respiratory symptoms . The disease later progresses to a latent phase with less symptoms and ultimately into a chronic or obstructive phase months to years later . In the chronic state the disease causes inflammation of the bile ducts , gall bladder and may cause gall stones as well as fibrosis . While chronic inflammation is connected to increased cancer rates , it is unclear whether fasciolosis is associated with increased cancer risk . Up to half of those infected display no symptoms , and diagnosis is difficult because the worm eggs are often missed in fecal examination . The methods of detection are through fecal examination , parasite-specific antibody detection , or radiological diagnosis , as well as laparotomy . In case of a suspected outbreak it may be useful to keep track of dietary history , which is also useful for exclusion of differential diagnoses . Fecal examination is generally not helpful because the worm eggs can seldom be detected in the chronic phase of the infection . Eggs appear in the feces first between 9-11 weeks post-infection .",
  "/wiki/Fasciola_hepatica": "Fasciola hepatica , also known as the common liver fluke or sheep liver fluke , is a parasitic trematode ( fluke or flatworm , a type of helminth ) of the class Trematoda , phylum Platyhelminthes . It infects the livers of various mammals , including humans . The disease caused by the fluke is called fasciolosis or fascioliasis , which is a type of helminthiasis and has been classified as a neglected tropical disease . Fasciolosis is currently classified as a plant/food-borne trematode infection , often acquired through eating the parasite 's metacercariae encysted on plants . F. hepatica , which is distributed worldwide , has been known as an important parasite of sheep and cattle for decades and causes significant economic losses in these livestock species , up to \u00a323 million in the UK alone . Because of its relatively large size and economic importance , it has been the subject of many scientific investigations and may be the best-known of any trematode species . F. hepatica 's closest relative is Fasciola gigantica . These two flukes are sister species ; they share many morphological features and can mate with each other .",
  "/wiki/Fasciola_gigantica": "Fasciola gigantica is a parasitic flatworm of the class Trematoda , which causes tropical fascioliasis . It is regarded as one of the most important single platyhelminth infections of ruminants in Asia and Africa . Estimates of infection rates are as high as 80-100% in some [ which ? ] countries . The infection is commonly called fasciolosis . The prevalence of F. gigantica often overlaps with that of Fasciola hepatica , and the two species are so closely related in terms of genetics , behaviour , and morphological and anatomical structures that it is notoriously difficult to distinguish them . Therefore , sophisticated molecular techniques are required to correctly identify and diagnose the infection .",

The disease is spread by contact with fresh water contaminated with the parasites . These parasites are released from infected freshwater snails . The disease is especially common among children in developing countries , as they are more likely to play in contaminated water . Other high-risk groups include farmers , fishermen , and people using unclean water during daily living . It belongs to the group of helminth infections .

Adult flatworms parasitize blood capillaries of either the mesenteries or plexus of the bladder , depending on the infecting species . They are unique among trematodes and any other flatworms in that they are dioecious with distinct sexual dimorphism between male and female . Thousands of eggs are released and reach either the bladder or the intestine ( according to the infecting species ) , and these are then excreted in urine or feces to fresh water .
