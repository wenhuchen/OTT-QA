It officially became U.S. territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846 , but a separate Idaho Territory was not organized until 1863 , instead being included for periods in Oregon Territory and Washington Territory . Idaho was eventually admitted to the Union on July 3 , 1890 , becoming the 43rd state . Forming part of the Pacific Northwest ( and the associated Cascadia bioregion ) , Idaho is divided into several distinct geographic and climatic regions . The state 's north , the relatively isolated Idaho Panhandle , is closely linked with Eastern Washington with which it shares the Pacific Time Zone - the rest of the state uses the Mountain Time Zone .
