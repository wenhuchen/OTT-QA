  "/wiki/Membra_Jesu_Nostri": "Membra Jesu Nostri ( English : The Limbs of our Jesus ) , BuxWV 75 , is a cycle of seven cantatas composed by Dieterich Buxtehude in 1680 , and dedicated to Gustaf D\u00fcben . The full Latin title Membra Jesu nostri patientis sanctissima translates to The most holy limbs of our suffering Jesus . This work is known as the first Lutheran oratorio . The main text are stanzas from the Medieval hymn Salve mundi salutare - also known as the Rhythmica oratio - a poem formerly ascribed to Bernard of Clairvaux , but now thought more likely to have been written by Medieval poet Arnulf of Leuven ( died 1250 ) . It is divided into seven parts , each addressed to a different part of Christ 's crucified body : feet , knees , hands , sides , breast , heart , and face . In each part , biblical words referring to the limbs frame verses of the poem .",

  "/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach": "Johann Sebastian Bach [ a ] ( 31 March [ O.S . 21 March ] 1685 - 28 July 1750 ) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period . He is known for instrumental compositions such as the Brandenburg Concertos and the Goldberg Variations , and for vocal music such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor . Since the 19th-century Bach Revival he has generally been regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time . The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach . After being orphaned at age 10 , he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph , after which he continued his musical formation in L\u00fcneburg . From 1703 he was back in Thuringia , working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and , for longer stretches of time , at courts in Weimar , where he expanded his organ repertory , and K\u00f6then , where he was mostly engaged with chamber music . From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor ( cantor at St. Thomas ) in Leipzig . He composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city , and for its university 's student ensemble Collegium Musicum . From 1726 he published some of his keyboard and organ music . In Leipzig , as had happened during some of his earlier positions , he had difficult relations with his employer , a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign , Augustus , Elector of Saxony and King of Poland , in 1736 . In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions .",

When he was 35 , he moved to Hamburg to work as the director of music for the Johanneum and for civic musical events . The next ten years were a golden age in the musical tradition of Hamburg : Bernhard and his good friend Matthias Weckmann performed together and directed the latest compositions from Italy and Vienna , as well as composing an important collection of music in finely-wrought counterpoint . The Elector of Saxony recalled Bernhard to Dresden in 1674 , where he returned as assistant kapellmeister . Six years later , the large - and primarily Italian - musical establishment in the city was greatly reduced , until Bernhard remained the only kapellmeister at court . He continued composing , directing and caring for the music library in Dresden until his death in 1692 , at the age of 64 .

Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712 ; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727 . He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition . Within fifteen years , Handel had started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera . Musicologist Winton Dean writes that his operas show that Handel was not only a great composer ; he was a dramatic genius of the first order . As Alexander 's Feast ( 1736 ) was well received , Handel made a transition to English choral works . After his success with Messiah ( 1742 ) he never composed an Italian opera again . Almost blind , and having lived in England for nearly fifty years , he died in 1759 , a respected and rich man . His funeral was given full state honours , and he was buried in Westminster Abbey in London . Born the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach and Domenico Scarlatti , Handel is regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era , with works such as Messiah , Water Music , and Music for the Royal Fireworks remaining steadfastly popular .",

His father 's name is also given as Gilead , and , as his mother is described as a prostitute , this may indicate that his father might have been any of the men of that area . Jephthah led the Israelites in battle against Ammon and , in exchange for defeating the Ammonites , made a vow to sacrifice whatever would come out of the door of his house first . When his daughter was the first to come out of the house , he immediately regretted the vow , which would require him to sacrifice his daughter to God . Jephthah then carried out his vow , though some commentators have disputed as to whether or not the sacrifice was actually carried out . Traditionally , Jephthah is listed among major judges because of the length of the biblical narrative referring to him , but his story also shares features with those of the minor judges , such as his short tenure - only six years - in office .",

  "/wiki/Dido_and_Aeneas": "Dido and Aeneas ( Z . 626 ) is an opera in a prologue and three acts , written by the English Baroque composer Henry Purcell with a libretto by Nahum Tate . The dates of the composition and first performance of the opera are uncertain . It was composed no later than July 1688 , and had been performed at Josias Priest 's girls ' school in London by the end of 1689 . Some scholars argue for a date of composition as early as 1683 . The story is based on Book IV of Virgil 's Aeneid . It recounts the love of Dido , Queen of Carthage , for the Trojan hero Aeneas , and her despair when he abandons her . A monumental work in Baroque opera , Dido and Aeneas is remembered as one of Purcell 's foremost theatrical works . It was also Purcell 's only true opera , as well as his only all-sung dramatic work . One of the earliest known English operas , it owes much to John Blow 's Venus and Adonis , both in structure and in overall effect . The influence of Cavalli 's opera Didone is also apparent . Both works use the prologue/three acts format and there are similarities between , for instance , Mercury 's solo in Didone and the solo Come away fellow sailors in Purcell 's work .",
