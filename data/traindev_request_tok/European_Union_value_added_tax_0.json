It is composed of nine federated states ( Bundesl\u00e4nder ) , one of which is Vienna , Austria 's capital and its largest city . It is bordered by Germany to the northwest , Czech Republic to the north , Slovakia to the northeast , Hungary to the east , Slovenia and Italy to the south , and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west . Austria occupies an area of 83,879 km2 ( 32,386 sq mi ) and has a population of nearly 9 million people . While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects . Austria initially emerged as a margraviate around 976 and developed into a duchy and archduchy . In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds . It is divided into three highly autonomous regions : the Flemish Region in the north , Wallonia in the south , and the Brussels-Capital Region . Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region , as well as the richest region in terms of GDP per capita . Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups or communities : the Dutch-speaking Flemish Community , which constitutes about 60 percent of the population , and the French-speaking Community , which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians . A small German-speaking Community , numbering around one percent , exists in the East Cantons . The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual ( French and Dutch ) , although French is the dominant language . Belgium 's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of governance , made up of six different governments .",

It is bordered by Romania to the north , Serbia and North Macedonia to the west , Greece and Turkey to the south , and the Black Sea to the east . The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",

The earliest known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC . Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia , and Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world . Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC . As a strategic location in the Middle East , it was subsequently occupied by several major powers , including the empires of the Assyrians , Egyptians and Persians , from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great . Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) . Cyprus was placed under the UK 's administration based on the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914 . While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population , the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s . Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an extension of Anatolia by them ; while , since the 19th century , the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece , which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s . Following nationalist violence in the 1950s , Cyprus was granted independence in 1960 .",

It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language , spanning at least 3,500 years of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic , and many other writing systems . The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics . During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world , West Asia and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , Greek is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , and Turkey and by the Greek diaspora .

Like other Slavic languages , Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology and relatively flexible word order . Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin and German . The Czech-Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period , and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech-Slovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period . In the later 18th to mid-19th century , the modern written standard became codified in the context of the Czech National Revival . The main non-standard variety , known as Common Czech , is based on the vernacular of Prague , but is now spoken as an interdialect throughout most of the Czech Republic . The Moravian dialects spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech , although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak . Czech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory , comprising ten monophthongs , three diphthongs and 25 consonants ( divided into hard , neutral and soft categories ) . Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether . Czech has a raised alveolar trill , which is known to occur as a phoneme in only a few other languages , represented by the grapheme \u0159.

Croatia has an area of 56,594 square kilometres ( 21,851 square miles ) and a population of 4.28 million , most of whom are Roman Catholics . Croatia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Age . The Croats arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into two duchies by the 9th century . Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke Branimir . Tomislav became the first king by 925 , elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom , which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries . During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended , Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102 . In 1527 , faced with Ottoman conquest , the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of Austria to the Croatian throne . In October 1918 , in the final days of World War I , the State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs , independent from Austria-Hungary , was proclaimed in Zagreb , and in December 1918 it was merged into the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 ) .

It is the official and literary standard of Croatia and one of the official languages of the European Union . Croatian is also one of the official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a recognized minority language in Serbia and neighboring countries . Standard Croatian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian , Shtokavian , more specifically on Eastern Herzegovinian , which is also the basis of Standard Serbian , Bosnian , and Montenegrin . In the mid-18th century , the first attempts to provide a Croatian literary standard began on the basis of the Neo-Shtokavian dialect that served as a supraregional lingua franca pushing back regional Chakavian , Kajkavian , and Shtokavian vernaculars . The decisive role was played by Croatian Vukovians , who cemented the usage of Ijekavian Neo-Shtokavian as the literary standard in the late 19th and the beginning of the 20th century , in addition to designing a phonological orthography . Croatian is written in Gaj 's Latin alphabet . Besides the Shtokavian dialect , on which Standard Croatian is based , there are two other main dialects spoken on the territory of Croatia , Chakavian and Kajkavian . These dialects , and the four national standards , are usually subsumed under the term Serbo-Croatian in English , though this term is controversial for native speakers , and paraphrases such as Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian are therefore sometimes used instead , especially in diplomatic circles .",

Over 1.4 million people live in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area , which produces one third of the country 's GDP . Swedish is the second official language of Finland , which is mainly spoken in certain coastal areas and on \u00c5land . A large majority of Finns are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church . Finland was inhabited when the last ice age ended , approximately 9000 BC . Comb Ceramic culture introduced pottery 5200 BC and Corded Ware culture coincided with the start of agriculture between 3000 and 2500 BC . The Bronze Age and Iron Age were characterised by extensive contacts with other cultures in the Fennoscandian and Baltic regions .",

Finnish , along with Swedish , is an official language of Finland ; Finnish is also an official minority language in Sweden . In Sweden , both Standard Finnish and Me\u00e4nkieli , its own language or a dialect of Finnish , are spoken . The Kven language , a dialect of Finnish or even a distinct language , is spoken in Northern Norway by a minority group of Finnish descent . The status of Kven and Me\u00e4nkieli is debated . Finnish is a member of the Finnic language family and is typologically between fusional and agglutinative languages . It modifies and inflects nouns , adjectives , pronouns , numerals and verbs , depending on their roles in the sentence . Sentences are normally formed following the subject-verb-object syntax , although the extensive use of inflection allows them to be ordered otherwise . Words are written using a Latin-script alphabet derived from the Swedish alphabet , and are meant to be spelled exactly as they are pronounced , with each letter representing one phoneme . Vowel length and geminated consonants are distinguished , and its phonology includes a range of diphthongs , although vowel harmony limits which diphthongs are possible .",
  "/wiki/Swedish_language": "Swedish ( svenska [ \u02c8sv\u025b\u0302n\u02d0ska ] ( listen ) ) is a North Germanic language spoken natively by 10 million people , predominantly in Sweden ( as the sole official language ) and in parts of Finland , where it has equal legal standing with Finnish . It is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Danish , although the degree of mutual intelligibility is largely dependent on the dialect and accent of the speaker . Written Norwegian and Danish are usually more easily understood by Swedish speakers than the spoken languages , due to the differences in tone , accent and intonation . Swedish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . It has the most speakers of the North Germanic languages . Standard Swedish , spoken by most Swedes , is the national language that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established by the beginning of the 20th century . While distinct regional varieties descending from the older rural dialects still exist , the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized . The standard word order is , as in most Germanic languages , V2 , which means that the finite verb ( V ) appears in the second position ( 2 ) of a declarative main clause . Swedish morphology is similar to English ; that is , words have comparatively few inflections . Swedish has two genders and is generally seen to have two grammatical cases - nominative and genitive ( except for pronouns that , as in English , also are inflected in the object form ) - although it is debated if the genitive in Swedish should be seen as a genitive case or just the nominative plus the so-called genitive s , then seen as a clitic . Swedish has two grammatical numbers - plural and singular . Adjectives have discrete comparative and superlative forms and are also inflected according to gender , number and definiteness .",

English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law .

The Baltic Sea moderates climate , although it has four distinct seasons and snowy winters . After centuries of Swedish , Polish and Russian rule , a rule mainly executed by the Baltic German aristocracy , the Republic of Latvia was established on 18 November 1918 when it broke away from the Russian Empire and declared independence in the aftermath of World War I . However , by the 1930s the country became increasingly autocratic after the coup in 1934 establishing an authoritarian regime under K\u0101rlis Ulmanis . The country 's de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II , beginning with Latvia 's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union , followed by the invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and the re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944 ( Courland Pocket in 1945 ) to form the Latvian SSR for the next 45 years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the Communist regime 's illegal takeover . It ended with the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia on 4 May 1990 and restoring de facto independence on 21 August 1991 .

In 1525 William Tyndale used the transliteration Melite in Acts 28:1 for \u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03ad\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f21 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 as found in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin . Melita is the spelling used in the Authorized ( King James ) Version of 1611 and in the American Standard Version of 1901 . Malta is widely used in more recent versions , such as The Revised Standard Version of 1946 and The New International Version of 1973 . Another conjecture suggests that the word Malta comes from the Phoenician word Maleth , a haven , or 'port ' in reference to Malta 's many bays and coves . Few other etymological mentions appear in classical literature , with the term Malta appearing in its present form in the Antonine Itinerary ( Itin . Marit . p. 518 ; Sil . Ital .",
  "/wiki/Maltese_language": "Maltese ( Maltese : Malti ) is a Semitic language spoken by the Maltese people of Malta . It is a standardised and Latinised variety of Arabic . It is the national language of the country and also serves as an official language of the European Union , the only Semitic language so distinguished . Maltese is descended from Siculo-Arabic , which developed as a Maghrebi Arabic dialect during the Emirate of Sicily between 831 and 1091 . As a result of the Norman invasion of Malta and the subsequent re-christianisation of the island , Maltese evolved independently of Classical Arabic in a gradual process of Latinisation . It is therefore exceptional as a variety of Arabic that has no diglossic relationship with Classical or Modern Standard Arabic . Maltese morphology has been deeply influenced by Romance languages , namely Italian and Sicilian . The original Arabic base comprises around one-third of the Maltese vocabulary , especially words that denote basic ideas and the function words , but about half of the vocabulary is derived from standard Italian and Sicilian ; and English words make up between 6% and 20% of the vocabulary . However , rural dialects of Maltese show more similarities to the original Siculo-Arabic ancestor as compared to Standard Maltese . A 2016 study shows that , in terms of basic everyday language , speakers of Maltese are able to understand less than a third of what is said to them in Tunisian Arabic , which is a Maghrebi Arabic dialect with a significant Latin substratum , whereas speakers of Tunisian Arabic are able to understand about 40% of what is said to them in Maltese . This reported level of asymmetric intelligibility is considerably lower than the mutual intelligibility found between other varieties of Arabic . Maltese has always been written in the Latin script , the earliest surviving example dating from the late Middle Ages .",
