  "/wiki/New_York_Yanks": "The New York Yanks were an American football team that played in the National Football League under that name in the 1950 and 1951 seasons . The team began as the Boston Yanks , owned by Kate Smith 's manager , Ted Collins . He wanted a team in New York City , but had to be content with one in Boston after the New York Giants refused to let his new team share the New York area . In 1949 , however , Collins , suspecting that the All-America Football Conference was on its last legs , got permission to move to New York . Rather than a formal relocation , however , Collins asked the NFL to fold his Boston franchise and grant him a new one for New York - most likely as a tax write-off . This new team played as the New York Bulldogs and shared the Polo Grounds with the Giants during the 1949 season . In 1950 , Collins changed his franchise 's name to the New York Yanks and moved to Yankee Stadium . For all intents and purposes , however , this was an almost entirely new team . Only four players from the 1949 Bulldogs ( Joe Domnanovich , Joe Golding , John Nolan and John Rauch ) played for the Yanks in 1950 . In contrast , there were 18 players from the New York Yankees of the AAFC ( Bruce Alford , George Brown , Brad Ecklund , Don Garza , Sherman Howard , Duke Iverson , Harvey Johnson , Bob Kennedy , Lou Kusseow , Pete Layden , Paul Mitchell , Barney Poole , Martin Ruby , Jack Russell , Ed Sharkey , Joe Signaigo , John Wozniak and Buddy Young ) .

  "/wiki/2014_NFL_Draft": "The 2014 NFL draft was the 79th annual meeting of National Football League ( NFL ) franchises to select newly eligible football players to the league . The draft , officially the Player Selection Meeting , was held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City , New York , on May 8th through May 10th , 2014 . One of the most anticipated drafts in recent years kicked off on May 8 , 2014 at 8 pm EDT . The draft was moved from its traditional time frame in late April due to a scheduling conflict at Radio City Music Hall . There was early discussion and rumors leading up to the draft on the future of staying at the current location in New York City , where it had been held since 1965 . Given the increased interest the draft had garnered over the past decade , there was belief that the event may have outgrown Radio City Music Hall , which had been the venue for the past nine drafts . The possibility of extending the draft to four days was also being discussed throughout the months leading up to the draft . The NFL decided in that summer that the 2015 NFL Draft will take place at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago , Illinois . The Houston Texans opened the draft by selecting defensive end Jadeveon Clowney from the University of South Carolina . The last time a defensive player was taken with the first overall selection was in 2006 , when the Texans selected Mario Williams . The Texans also closed the draft with the selection of safety Lonnie Ballentine of the University of Memphis as Mr . Irrelevant , which is the title given to the final player selected .",

  "/wiki/2015_NFL_Draft": "The 2015 NFL Draft was the 80th annual meeting of National Football League ( NFL ) franchises to select newly eligible football players . It took place in Chicago at the Auditorium Theatre and in Grant Park , from April 30 to May 2 . The previous fifty NFL drafts ( since 1965 ) had been held in New York City . The 2015 NFL draft was the first to feature an outdoor component , where fans would be able to see the Commissioner on the Auditorium Theatre stage from across the street in the park ; this area was called Draft Town . The Tampa Bay Buccaneers held the right to select first because they had the league 's worst record in the previous season . The Arizona Cardinals made the final pick in the draft , commonly called Mr . Irrelevant . One of the major storylines approaching the NFL draft was the competition between the previous two Heisman Trophy winners , Jameis Winston winning the award in 2013 and Marcus Mariota in 2014 . Both were considered excellent prospects and had the potential to become the first overall draft selection . Winston was considered to be a more polished pocket passer and pro-style quarterback , but had several off-the-field issues while playing at Florida State , ranging from a sexual assault allegation to shoplifting incidents . Mariota was considered a better athlete , the fastest quarterback in the draft , and had a better off-the-field reputation . However , Mariota ran a spread offense at Oregon which typically had not transitioned well from college to the NFL .",

  "/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals": "The Cincinnati Bengals are a professional American football franchise based in Cincinnati , Ohio . The Bengals compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) North division . Their home stadium is Paul Brown Stadium , located in downtown Cincinnati . Their divisional opponents are the Baltimore Ravens , Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers . The Bengals were founded in 1966 as a member of the American Football League ( AFL ) by former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown , and began play in the 1968 season . Brown was the Bengals ' head coach from their inception to 1975 . After being dismissed as the Browns ' head coach by Art Modell ( who had purchased majority interest in the team in 1961 ) in January 1963 , Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus . He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city , Hamilton County , and Major League Baseball 's Cincinnati Reds ( who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field ) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games . Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL , which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season , Brown agreed to join the AFL as its tenth and final franchise . The Bengals , like the other former AFL teams , were assigned to the AFC following the merger . Cincinnati was also selected because , like their neighbors the Reds , they could draw from several large neighboring cities ( Louisville and Lexington , Kentucky ; Columbus , Dayton , and Springfield , Ohio ) that are all no more than 110 miles ( 180 km ) away from downtown Cincinnati , along with Indianapolis , until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season . The Bengals won the AFC championship in 1981 and 1988 , but lost Super Bowls XVI and XXIII to the San Francisco 49ers ."
