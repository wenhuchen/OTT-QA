  "/wiki/Battle_of_Elsenborn_Ridge": "The Battle of Elsenborn Ridge refers to the northernmost German attacks during the Battle of the Bulge ; the area from Elsenborn Ridge itself to Monschau was the only sector of the American front line attacked during the Battle of the Bulge where the Germans failed to advance . :33 The battle centered on the boomerang-shaped Elsenborn Ridge east of Elsenborn , Belgium . In this region , Elsenborn Ridge marks the westernmost ridge of the Ardennes , rising more than 2,000 feet ( 600 m ) above sea level ; unlike the uplands further north , east and south , it has been extensively logged . West of Elsenborn Ridge , where the land descends in gentle hills to the cities of Li\u00e8ge and Spa , was a network of Allied supply bases and a well-developed road network . The Germans planned on using two key routes through the area to seize Antwerp and force a separate peace with the United States and Britain . :259-271 Capturing Monschau , the nearby village of H\u00f6fen , and the twin villages of Rocherath-Krinkelt just east of Elsenborn Ridge , were key to the success of the German plans , and Hitler committed his best armored units to the area . The untested troops of the 99th Infantry Division had been placed in the sector during mid-November because the Allies thought that the area was unlikely to see battle . The division was stretched thin over a 22-mile ( 35 km ) front , and all three regiments were in the line with no reserve . In early December , the 2nd Infantry Division was assigned to capture a crossroads named Wahlerscheid , at the southern tip of the Hurtgen Forest . German forces counterattacked in what the Americans initially thought was a localized spoiling action , but was actually a leading element of the Battle of the Bulge . The 2nd Division consolidated its lines , pulling back into H\u00fcnningen , then Rocherath-Krinkelt , and finally to the dug-in positions held by the 99th Division at Elsenborn Ridge . In a fierce battle lasting ten days , the American and German lines were often confused .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge": "The Battle of the Bulge , also known as the Ardennes Counteroffensive , was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II , and took place from 16 December 1944 to 25 January 1945 . It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region of Wallonia in eastern Belgium , northeast France , and Luxembourg , towards the end of the war in Europe . The offensive was intended to stop Allied use of the Belgian port of Antwerp and to split the Allied lines , allowing the Germans to encircle and destroy four Allied armies and force the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis powers ' favor . The Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944 , due to a combination of Allied overconfidence , preoccupation with Allied offensive plans , and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather . American forces bore the brunt of the attack and incurred their highest casualties of any operation during the war . The battle also severely depleted Germany 's armored forces , and they were largely unable to replace them . German personnel and , later , Luftwaffe aircraft ( in the concluding stages of the engagement ) also sustained heavy losses . The Germans had attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line , taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions that grounded the Allies ' overwhelmingly superior air forces . Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive , around Elsenborn Ridge , and in the south , around Bastogne , blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success . Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads . This , and terrain that favored the defenders , threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops . The farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-N\u00f4tre-Dame , south east of Dinant , being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944 .",
  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire . War in the Balkans , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz , and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Saint-Mihiel": "The Battle of Saint-Mihiel was a major World War I battle fought from 12-15 September 1918 , involving the American Expeditionary Forces ( AEF ) and 110,000 French troops under the command of General John J. Pershing of the United States against German positions . The U.S. Army Air Service played a significant role in this action . This battle marked the first use of the terms D-Day and H-Hour by the Americans . The attack at the Saint-Mihiel salient was part of a plan by Pershing in which he hoped that the Americans would break through the German lines and capture the fortified city of Metz . It was the first and only offensive launched mainly by the United States Army in World War I , and the attack caught the Germans in the process of retreating . This meant that their artillery was out of place and the American attack , coming up against disorganized German forces , proved more successful than expected . The Saint-Mihiel attack established the stature of the U.S. Army in the eyes of the French and British forces , and again demonstrated the critical role of artillery during World War I and the difficulty of supplying such massive armies while they were on the move . The U.S. attack faltered as artillery and food supplies were left behind on the muddy roads . The attack on Metz was not realized , as the Supreme Allied Commander Ferdinand Foch ordered the American troops to march towards Sedan and M\u00e9zi\u00e8res , which would lead to the Meuse-Argonne Offensive .",
  "/wiki/World_War_I": "World War I ( often abbreviated as WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . Contemporaneously described as the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , making it one of the largest wars in history . It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history , with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war , while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide . On 28 June 1914 , Gavrilo Princip , a Bosnian Serb Yugoslav nationalist , assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , leading to the July Crisis . In response , on 23 July , Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia . Serbia 's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians , and the two moved to a war footing . A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe . By July 1914 , the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions : the Triple Entente - consisting of France , Russia , and Britain - and the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy ( the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature , allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915 , when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated ) . Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia and , after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade on the 28 July , approved partial mobilisation . Full Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July ; on the 31st , Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same , while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within twelve hours . When Russia failed to comply , Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary , with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6 August ; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August . German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within six weeks , then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise ; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan .",

The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war 's turning point . Union Maj. Gen. George Meade 's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , halting Lee 's invasion of the North . After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 , Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North - the Gettysburg Campaign . With his army in high spirits , Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , or even Philadelphia . Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit , but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade . Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1 , 1863 , as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there , his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it . Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig . Gen. John Buford , and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry . However , two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north , collapsing the hastily developed Union lines , sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south . On the second day of battle , most of both armies had assembled . The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook .",
  "/wiki/American_Civil_War": "The American Civil War ( also known by other names ) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865 , fought between the northern United States ( loyal to the Union ) and the southern United States ( that had seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy ) . [ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people . War broke out in April 1861 when secessionist forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina shortly after Abraham Lincoln had been inaugurated as the President of the United States . The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country . [ f ] The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union . [ g ] The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf": "The Battle of Leyte Gulf ( Filipino : Labanan sa Look ng Leyte ) is considered to have been the largest naval battle of World War II and is , by some criteria , a contender for the title largest naval battle in history , with over 200,000 naval personnel involved . It was fought in waters near the Philippine islands of Leyte , Samar , and Luzon , from 23-26 October 1944 , between combined American and Australian forces and the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) , as part of the invasion of Leyte , which aimed to isolate Japan from the countries it had occupied in Southeast Asia which were a vital source of industrial and oil supplies . By the time of the battle , Japan had fewer capital ships ( aircraft carriers and battleships ) left than the Allied forces had total aircraft carriers , underscoring the disparity in force strength at this point in the war . Regardless , the IJN mobilized nearly all of its remaining major naval vessels in an attempt to defeat the Allied invasion , but it was repulsed by the U.S. Navy 's Third and Seventh fleets . The battle consisted of four main separate engagements : the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea , the Battle of Surigao Strait , the Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o and the Battle off Samar , as well as lesser actions . This was the first battle in which Japanese aircraft carried out organized kamikaze attacks , and the last naval battle between battleships in history . The IJN suffered heavy losses and never sailed in comparable force thereafter , stranded for lack of fuel in their bases for the rest of the war , and were unable to affect the successful Allied invasion of Leyte .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Spotsylvania": "The Battle of Spotsylvania Court House , sometimes more simply referred to as the Battle of Spotsylvania ( or the 19th-century spelling Spottsylvania ) , was the second major battle in Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant 's 1864 Overland Campaign of the American Civil War . Following the bloody but inconclusive Battle of the Wilderness , Grant 's army disengaged from Confederate General Robert E. Lee 's army and moved to the southeast , attempting to lure Lee into battle under more favorable conditions . Elements of Lee 's army beat the Union army to the critical crossroads of Spotsylvania Court House , Virginia , and began entrenching . Fighting occurred on and off from May 8 through May 21 , 1864 , as Grant tried various schemes to break the Confederate line . In the end , the battle was tactically inconclusive , but both sides declared victory . The Confederacy declared victory because they were able to hold their defenses . The United States declared victory because the Federal offensive continued and Lee 's army suffered losses that could not be replaced . With almost 32,000 casualties on both sides , Spotsylvania was the costliest battle of the campaign . On May 8 , Union Maj. Gens . Gouverneur K. Warren and John Sedgwick unsuccessfully attempted to dislodge the Confederates under Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson from Laurel Hill , a position that was blocking them from Spotsylvania Court House . On May 10 , Grant ordered attacks across the Confederate line of earthworks , which by now extended over 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) , including a prominent salient known as the Mule Shoe . Although the Union troops failed again at Laurel Hill , an innovative assault attempt by Col. Emory Upton against the Mule Shoe showed promise .",
  "/wiki/D-day": "The Normandy landings were the landing operations on Tuesday , 6 June 1944 of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II . Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred to as D-Day , it was the largest seaborne invasion in history . The operation began the liberation of German-occupied France ( and later western Europe ) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front . Planning for the operation began in 1943 . In the months leading up to the invasion , the Allies conducted a substantial military deception , codenamed Operation Bodyguard , to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings . The weather on D-Day was far from ideal , and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours ; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks , as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon , the tides , and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable . Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion . The amphibious landings were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment and an airborne assault - the landing of 24,000 American , British , and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight . Allied infantry and armoured divisions began landing on the coast of France at 06:30 . The target 50-mile ( 80 km ) stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into five sectors : Utah , Omaha , Gold , Juno , and Sword . Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions , particularly at Utah and Omaha . The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches , and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes , metal tripods , and barbed wire , making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous .",
  "/wiki/Operation_Overlord": "Operation Overlord was the codename for the Battle of Normandy , the Allied operation that launched the successful invasion of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II . The operation was launched on 6 June 1944 with the Normandy landings ( Operation Neptune , commonly known as D-Day ) . A 1,200-plane airborne assault preceded an amphibious assault involving more than 5,000 vessels . Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June , and more than two million Allied troops were in France by the end of August . The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943 . General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , and General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group , which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion . The coast of Normandy of northwestern France was chosen as the site of the invasion , with the Americans assigned to land at sectors codenamed Utah and Omaha , the British at Sword and Gold , and the Canadians at Juno . To meet the conditions expected on the Normandy beachhead , special technology was developed , including two artificial ports called Mulberry harbours and an array of specialised tanks nicknamed Hobart 's Funnies . In the months leading up to the invasion , the Allies conducted a substantial military deception , Operation Bodyguard , using both electronic and visual misinformation . This misled the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings . F\u00fchrer Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in charge of developing fortifications all along Hitler 's proclaimed Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an invasion .

The attack led to the United States ' formal entry into World War II the next day . The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI , and as Operation Z during its planning . Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States . Over the course of seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines , Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya , Singapore , and Hong Kong .

Both armies suffered heavy casualties , around 5,000 men killed in total , a harbinger of a bloody war of attrition by Grant against Lee 's army and , eventually , the Confederate capital , Richmond , Virginia . The battle was tactically inconclusive , as Grant disengaged and continued his offensive . Grant attempted to move quickly through the dense underbrush of the Wilderness of Spotsylvania , but Lee launched two of his corps on parallel roads to intercept him . On the morning of May 5 , the Union V Corps under Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren attacked the Confederate Second Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell , on the Orange Turnpike . That afternoon the Third Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill , encountered Brig . Gen. George W. Getty 's division ( VI Corps ) and Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock 's II Corps on the Orange Plank Road . Fighting until dark was fierce but inconclusive as both sides attempted to maneuver in the dense woods . At dawn on May 6 , Hancock attacked along the Plank Road , driving Hill 's Corps back in confusion , but the First Corps of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet arrived in time to prevent the collapse of the Confederate right flank . Longstreet followed up with a surprise flanking attack from an unfinished railroad bed that drove Hancock 's men back to the Brock Road , but the momentum was lost when Longstreet was wounded by his own men .

Part of the Maryland Campaign , it was the first field army-level engagement in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War to take place on Union soil . It was the bloodiest day in United States military history , with a combined tally of 22,717 dead , wounded , or missing . After pursuing the Confederate general Robert E. Lee into Maryland , Maj.

It was the longest battle on German ground during World War II and is the longest single battle the U.S. Army has ever fought . The U.S. commanders ' initial goal was to pin down German forces in the area to keep them from reinforcing the front lines farther north in the Battle of Aachen , where the US forces were fighting against the Siegfried Line network of fortified industrial towns and villages speckled with pillboxes , tank traps , and minefields . A secondary objective may have been to outflank the front line . [ citation needed ] The Americans ' initial tactical objectives were to take Schmidt and clear Monschau . In a second phase the Allies wanted to advance to the Rur River as part of Operation Queen . Generalfeldmarschall Walter Model intended to bring the Allied thrust to a standstill . While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of units than at the Battle of Arnhem , he still kept himself fully informed on the situation , slowing the Allies ' progress , inflicting heavy casualties , and taking full advantage of the fortifications the Germans called the Westwall , better known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line . The H\u00fcrtgen Forest cost the U.S. First Army at least 33,000 killed and wounded , including both combat and non-combat losses , with upper estimate at 55,000 ; German casualties were 28,000 . The city of Aachen in the north eventually fell on 22 October at high cost to the U.S. Ninth Army , but they failed to cross the Rur or wrest control of its dams from the Germans . The battle was so costly that it has been described as an Allied defeat of the first magnitude , with specific credit given to Model . :391 The Germans fiercely defended the area because it served as a staging area for the 1944 winter offensive Unternehmen : Wacht am Rhein ( later known as the Battle of the Bulge ) , and because the mountains commanded access to the Rur Dam [ notes 3 ] at the head of the Rur Reservoir ( Rurstausee ) .",

G. T. Beauregard second-in-command ) launched a surprise attack on Grant 's army from its base in Corinth , Mississippi . Johnston was mortally wounded during the fighting ; Beauregard took command of the army and decided against pressing the attack late in the evening . Overnight , Grant was reinforced by one of his divisions stationed further north and was joined by three divisions from the Army of the Ohio ( Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell ) . The Union forces began an unexpected counterattack the next morning which reversed the Confederate gains of the previous day . On April 6 , the first day of the battle , the Confederates struck with the intention of driving the Union defenders away from the river and into the swamps of Owl Creek to the west . Johnston hoped to defeat Grant 's army before the anticipated arrival of Buell and the Army of the Ohio . The Confederate battle lines became confused during the fighting , and Grant 's men instead fell back to the northeast , in the direction of Pittsburg Landing . A Union position on a slightly sunken road , nicknamed the Hornet 's Nest and defended by the divisions of Brig . Gens . Benjamin Prentiss and William H. L.

Withdrawing a few miles to the northwest , Jackson took up strong concealed defensive positions on Stony Ridge and awaited the arrival of the wing of Lee 's army commanded by Maj. Gen. James Longstreet . On August 28 , 1862 , Jackson attacked a Union column just east of Gainesville , at Brawner 's Farm , resulting in a stalemate but successfully getting Pope 's attention . On that same day , Longstreet broke through light Union resistance in the Battle of Thoroughfare Gap and approached the battlefield . Pope became convinced that he had trapped Jackson and concentrated the bulk of his army against him . On August 29 , Pope launched a series of assaults against Jackson 's position along an unfinished railroad grade . The attacks were repulsed with heavy casualties on both sides . At noon , Longstreet arrived on the field from Thoroughfare Gap and took position on Jackson 's right flank . On August 30 , Pope renewed his attacks , seemingly unaware that Longstreet was on the field . When massed Confederate artillery devastated a Union assault by Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter 's V Corps , Longstreet 's wing of 25,000 men in five divisions counterattacked in the largest simultaneous mass assault of the war .",
  "/wiki/Seven_Days_Battles": "The Seven Days Battles were a series of seven battles over seven days from June 25 to July 1 , 1862 , near Richmond , Virginia , during the American Civil War . Confederate General Robert E. Lee drove the invading Union Army of the Potomac , commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan , away from Richmond and into a retreat down the Virginia Peninsula . The series of battles is sometimes known erroneously as the Seven Days Campaign , but it was actually the culmination of the Peninsula Campaign , not a separate campaign in its own right . The Seven Days began on Wednesday , June 25 , 1862 , with a Union attack in the minor Battle of Oak Grove , but McClellan quickly lost the initiative as Lee began a series of attacks at Beaver Dam Creek ( Mechanicsville ) on June 26 , Gaines 's Mill on June 27 , the minor actions at Garnett 's and Golding 's Farm on June 27 and 28 , and the attack on the Union rear guard at Savage 's Station on June 29 . McClellan 's Army of the Potomac continued its retreat toward the safety of Harrison 's Landing on the James River . Lee 's final opportunity to intercept the Union Army was at the Battle of Glendale on June 30 , but poorly executed orders and the delay of Stonewall Jackson 's troops allowed his enemy to escape to a strong defensive position on Malvern Hill . At the Battle of Malvern Hill on July 1 , Lee launched futile frontal assaults and suffered heavy casualties in the face of strong infantry and artillery defenses . The Seven Days ended with McClellan 's army in relative safety next to the James River , having suffered almost 16,000 casualties during the retreat . Lee 's army , which had been on the offensive during the Seven Days , lost over 20,000 . As Lee became convinced that McClellan would not resume his threat against Richmond , he moved north for the northern Virginia campaign and the Maryland campaign .",
  "/wiki/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal": "The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal , sometimes referred to as the Third and Fourth Battles of Savo Island , the Battle of the Solomons , the Battle of Friday the 13th , or , in Japanese sources , the Third Battle of the Solomon Sea ( \u7b2c\u4e09\u6b21\u30bd\u30ed\u30e2\u30f3\u6d77\u6226 , Dai-san-ji Soromon Kaisen ) , took place from 12-15 November 1942 , and was the decisive engagement in a series of naval battles between Allied ( primarily American ) and Imperial Japanese forces during the months-long Guadalcanal Campaign in the Solomon Islands during World War II . The action consisted of combined air and sea engagements over four days , most near Guadalcanal and all related to a Japanese effort to reinforce land forces on the island . The only two U.S. Navy admirals to be killed in a surface engagement in the war were lost in this battle . Allied forces landed on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 and seized an airfield , later called Henderson Field , that was under construction by the Japanese military . There were several subsequent attempts to recapture the airfield by the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy using reinforcements delivered to Guadalcanal by ship , efforts which ultimately failed . In early November 1942 , the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield . Several Japanese warship forces were assigned to bombard Henderson Field with the goal of destroying Allied aircraft that posed a threat to the convoy . Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort , U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship attacks to defend Henderson Field and prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal . In the resulting battle , both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive surface engagements at night . Nevertheless , the U.S. succeeded in turning back attempts by the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships . Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented the majority of the Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal . Thus , the battle turned back Japan 's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi , resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in their favor .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Stones_River": "The Battle of Stones River ( also known as the Second Battle of Murfreesboro ) was a battle fought from December 31 , 1862 , to January 2 , 1863 , in Middle Tennessee , as the culmination of the Stones River Campaign in the Western Theater of the American Civil War . Of the major battles of the war , Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties on both sides . Although the battle itself was inconclusive , the Union Army 's repulse of two Confederate attacks and the subsequent Confederate withdrawal were a much-needed boost to Union morale after the defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg , and it dashed Confederate aspirations for control of Middle Tennessee . Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans 's Army of the Cumberland marched from Nashville , Tennessee , on December 26 , 1862 , to challenge General Braxton Bragg 's Army of Tennessee at Murfreesboro . On December 31 , each army commander planned to attack his opponent 's right flank , but Bragg struck first . A massive assault by the corps of Maj. Gen. William J. Hardee , followed by that of Leonidas Polk , overran the wing commanded by Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook . A stout defense by the division of Brig . Gen. Philip Sheridan in the right center of the line prevented a total collapse , and the Union assumed a tight defensive position backing up to the Nashville Turnpike . Repeated Confederate attacks were repulsed from this concentrated line , most notably in the cedar Round Forest salient against the brigade of Col. William B. Hazen . Bragg attempted to continue the assault with the division of Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge , but the troops were slow in arriving and their multiple piecemeal attacks failed . Fighting resumed on January 2 , 1863 , when Bragg ordered Breckinridge to assault the well-fortified Union position on a hill to the east of the Stones River . Faced with overwhelming artillery , the Confederates were repulsed with heavy losses .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Chickamauga": "The Battle of Chickamauga , fought on September 18 - 20 , 1863 , between U.S. and Confederate forces in the American Civil War , marked the end of a Union offensive , the Chickamauga Campaign , in southeastern Tennessee and northwestern Georgia . It was the first major battle of the war fought in Georgia , the most significant Union defeat in the Western Theater , and involved the second-highest number of casualties after the Battle of Gettysburg . The battle was fought between the Army of the Cumberland under Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans and the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Gen. Braxton Bragg , and was named for Chickamauga Creek , which meanders near the battle area in northwest Georgia ( and ultimately flows into the Tennessee River about 3.5 miles ( 5.6 km ) northeast of downtown Chattanooga ) . After his successful Tullahoma Campaign , Rosecrans renewed the offensive , aiming to force the Confederates out of Chattanooga . In early September , Rosecrans consolidated his forces scattered in Tennessee and Georgia and forced Bragg 's army out of Chattanooga , heading south . The Union troops followed it and brushed with it at Davis 's Cross Roads . Bragg was determined to reoccupy Chattanooga and decided to meet a part of Rosecrans 's army , to defeat it , and then to move back into the city . On September 17 he headed north , intending to attack the isolated XXI Corps . As Bragg marched north on September 18 , his cavalry and infantry fought with Union cavalry and mounted infantry , which were armed with Spencer repeating rifles . Fighting began in earnest on the morning of September 19 . Bragg 's men strongly assaulted but could not break the Union line . The next day , Bragg resumed his assault .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Chancellorsville": "The Battle of Chancellorsville was a major battle of the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , and the principal engagement of the Chancellorsville campaign . It was fought from April 30 to May 6 , 1863 , in Spotsylvania County , Virginia , near the village of Chancellorsville . Two related battles were fought nearby on May 3 in the vicinity of Fredericksburg . The campaign pitted Union Army Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker 's Army of the Potomac against an army less than half its size , General Robert E. Lee 's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia . Chancellorsville is known as Lee 's perfect battle because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory . The victory , a product of Lee 's audacity and Hooker 's timid decision-making , was tempered by heavy casualties , including Lt. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson . Jackson was hit by friendly fire , requiring his left arm to be amputated . He died of pneumonia eight days later , a loss that Lee likened to losing his right arm . Lee 's difficulty in replacing his lost men as well as his inability to prevent the Union withdrawal effectively have led to his great victory being regarded as a Pyrrhic one . The Chancellorsville campaign began with the crossing of the Rappahannock River by the Union army on the morning of April 27 , 1863 . Union cavalry under Maj. Gen. George Stoneman began a long-distance raid against Lee 's supply lines at about the same time . This operation was completely ineffectual .",
  "/wiki/Task_Force_Faith": "The Regimental Combat Team 31 ( RCT-31 ) , commonly referred to as Task Force Faith of the Chosin Few , is a United States Army unit known for its role in the Battle of Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War where 85.4% of its force was killed , wounded , and/or captured on the eastern side of the reservoir . RCT-31 primarily consisted of infantry , artillery , and tank units from the 7th Infantry Division including the 31st Infantry Regiment , 57th Field Artillery Battalion , 13th Engineer Combat Battalion , 73rd Heavy Tank Battalion , and the 15th Antiaircraft Automatic Weapons Battalion . It was also augmented by KATUSA ( also known as ROKs ) . The units of RCT-31 positioned at the Chosin Reservoir from 27 Nov - 2 Dec 1950 consisted of 3rd Battalion/31st Infantry , 1st Battalion/32nd Infantry Regiment , A and B Batteries/57th Field Artillery Battalion , D Battery/15th Anti-aircraft Automatic Weapons Battalion , and 750 KATUSA soldiers . Task Force Faith is a nickname coined by a U.S. Army historian in the 1960s ; the unit was not known by that name during the Korean War . Historians have subsequently also referred to RCT-31 as Task Force Ovenshine and Task Force MacLean to distinguish the various periods of command .",
  "/wiki/Korean_War": "The Korean War ( in South Korean Korean : \ud55c\uad6d\uc804\uc7c1 ; Hanja : \u97d3\u570b\u6230\u722d ; RR : Hanguk Jeonjaeng , Korean War ; in North Korean Korean : \uc870\uad6d\ud574\ubc29\uc804\uc7c1 ; Hanja : \u7956\u570b\u89e3\u653e\u6230\u722d ; MR : Choguk haebang ch\u014fnjaeng , Fatherland Liberation War ; 25 June 1950 - 27 July 1953 ) [ b ] was a war between North Korea ( with the support of China and the Soviet Union ) and South Korea ( with the support of the United Nations , principally from the United States ) . The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea . At the end of World War II , the Soviet Union and the United States liberated Korea from imperial Japanese colonial control on 15 August 1945 . After the war had ended , Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation , the Soviets administered the northern half and the Americans administered the southern half . With the border set at the 38th parallel in 1948 , two sovereign states were established as a result of geopolitical tensions of the Cold War ( between the Soviet Union and the United States ) . A socialist state was established in the north under the communist leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the anti-communist leadership of Syngman Rhee . Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea , and neither accepted the border as permanent . The conflict escalated into warfare when North Korean military ( KPA ) forces - supported by the Soviet Union and China - crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950 . The United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion . Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force , with the United States providing around 90% of the military personnel . After the first two months of war , South Korean Army ( ROKA ) and the US forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat . As a result , the ROKA and US troops retreated to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter ."
