  "/wiki/Call_to_the_Bar": "The call to the bar is a legal term of art in most common law jurisdictions where persons must be qualified to be allowed to argue in court on behalf of another party and are then said to have been called to the bar or to have received a call to the bar . The bar is now used as a collective noun for barristers , but literally referred to the wooden barrier in old courtrooms , which separated the often crowded public area at the rear from the space near the judges reserved for those having business with the Court . Barristers would sit or stand immediately behind it , facing the judge , and could use it as a table for their briefs . Like many other common law terms , the term originated in England in the Middle Ages , and the call to the bar refers to the summons issued to one found fit to speak at the 'bar ' of the royal courts . In time , English judges allowed only legally qualified men to address them on the law and later delegated the qualification and admission of barristers to the four Inns of Court . Once an Inn calls one of its members to its bar , they are thereafter a barrister . They may not , however , practise as a barrister until they have completed ( or been exempted from ) an apprenticeship called pupillage . After completing pupillage , they are considered to be a practising barrister with a right of audience before all courts . England and Wales and some other jurisdictions distinguish two types of lawyers , who are regulated by different bodies , with separate training , examinations , regulation and traditions :",

  "/wiki/Jesus_College,_Oxford": "Jesus College ( in full : Jesus College in the University of Oxford of Queen Elizabeth 's Foundation ) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England . It is in the centre of the city , on a site between Turl Street , Ship Street , Cornmarket Street and Market Street . The college was founded by Elizabeth I on 27 June 1571 for the education of clergy , though students now study a broad range of secular subjects . A major driving force behind the establishment of the college was Hugh Price ( or Ap Rhys ) , a churchman from Brecon in Wales . The oldest buildings , in the first quadrangle , date from the 16th and early 17th centuries ; a second quadrangle was added between about 1640 and about 1713 , and a third quadrangle was built in about 1906 . Further accommodation was built on the main site to mark the 400th anniversary of the college , in 1971 , and student flats have been constructed at sites in north and east Oxford . The life of the college was disrupted by the English Civil War . Leoline Jenkins , who became principal after the war in 1661 , put the college on a more stable financial footing . Little happened at the college during the 18th century , and the 19th century saw a decline in numbers and academic standards . Reforms of Oxford University after two Royal Commissions in the latter half of the 19th century led to removal of many of the restrictions placed on the college 's fellowships and scholarships , such that the college ceased to be predominantly full of Welsh students and academics . Students ' academic achievements rose in the early 20th century as fellows were appointed to teach in new subjects . Women were first admitted in 1974 and now form a large part of the undergraduate population .",
