  "/wiki/Chinese_yuan": "The renminbi ( abbreviated RMB ; simplified Chinese : \u4eba\u6c11\u5e01 ; traditional Chinese : \u4eba\u6c11\u5e63 ; pinyin : r\u00e9nm\u00ednb\u00ec ; literally : 'people 's currency ' ; symbol : \u5143/\u00a5 ; code : CNY ) is the official currency of the People 's Republic of China , and one of the world 's major reserve currencies . The yuan ( Chinese : \u5143 ; pinyin : yu\u00e1n ) is the basic unit of the renminbi , but is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally , especially in international contexts where Chinese yuan is widely used to refer to the renminbi . The distinction between renminbi and yuan is that renminbi is the name of the currency and yuan refers to its primary unit . One yuan is subdivided into 10 jiao ( Chinese : \u89d2 ; pinyin : ji\u01ceo ) , and a jiao in turn is subdivided into 10 fen ( Chinese : \u5206 ; pinyin : f\u0113n ) . The renminbi is issued by the People 's Bank of China , the monetary authority of China . The renminbi is sometimes referred to as the redback in the US financial press . Until 2005 , the value of the renminbi was pegged to the US dollar . As China pursued its transition from central planning to a market economy and increased its participation in foreign trade , the renminbi was devalued to increase the competitiveness of Chinese industry . It has previously been claimed that the renminbi 's official exchange rate was undervalued by as much as 37.5% against its purchasing power parity . However more recently , appreciation actions by the Chinese government , as well as quantitative easing measures taken by the American Federal Reserve and other major central banks , have caused the renminbi to be within as little as 8% of its equilibrium value by the second half of 2012 . Since 2006 , the renminbi exchange rate has been allowed to float in a narrow margin around a fixed base rate determined with reference to a basket of world currencies . The Chinese government has announced that it will gradually increase the flexibility of the exchange rate .",
