Born in Guangzhou but raised in Hong Kong and Shanghai , Pei drew inspiration at an early age from the garden villas at Suzhou , the traditional retreat of the scholar-gentry to which his family belonged . In 1935 , he moved to the United States and enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania 's architecture school , but he quickly transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . He was unhappy with the focus at both schools on Beaux-Arts architecture , and spent his free time researching emerging architects , especially Le Corbusier . After graduating , he joined the Harvard Graduate School of Design ( GSD ) and became a friend of the Bauhaus architects Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer . In 1948 , Pei was recruited by New York City real estate magnate William Zeckendorf , for whom he worked for seven years before establishing an independent design firm in 1955 , I. M. Pei & Associates . In 1966 that became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966 , and in 1989 became Pei Cobb Freed & Partners . Pei retired from full-time practice in 1990 . In his retirement , he worked as an architectural consultant primarily from his sons ' architectural firm Pei Partnership Architects . Pei 's first major recognition came with the Mesa Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado ( designed in 1961 , and completed in 1967 ) . His new stature led to his selection as chief architect for the John F. Kennedy Library in Massachusetts . He went on to design Dallas City Hall and the East Building of the National Gallery of Art .",
  "/wiki/Brutalist_architecture": "Brutalist architecture , or Brutalism , is an architectural style which emerged in the mid-20th century and gained popularity in the late 1950s and 1960s . It descended from the modernist architectural movement of the late 19th century and of the first half of 20th century , and is characterized by simple , block-like structures that often feature bare building materials . Exposed concrete is favored in construction ; however , some examples are primarily made of brick . Though beginning in Europe , Brutalist architecture can now be found around the world . The style has been most commonly used in the design of institutional buildings , such as libraries , courts , public housing and city halls . Brutalism 's stark , geometric designs contrast with the more ornate features of some architecture of the 1910s , 1920s , and 1930s . Brutalist designs have historically been polarising ; specific buildings , as well as the movement as a whole , have drawn a range of criticism and support from architects and the public . Many brutalist buildings have become architectural and cultural icons , with some UK buildings obtaining listed status .",

Its primary financial services revolve around commercial banking , wealth management , and investment banking . One branch of its history stretches back to Bank of Italy , founded by Amadeo Pietro Giannini in 1904 , which provided Italian immigrants who faced service discrimination various banking options . Originally headquartered in San Francisco , California , Giannini acquired Banca d'America e d'Italia ( Bank of America and Italy ) in 1922 . The passage of landmark federal banking legislation facilitated rapid growth in the 1950s , quickly establishing a prominent market share . After suffering a significant loss after the 1998 Russian bond default , BankAmerica , as it was then known , was acquired by the Charlotte-based NationsBank for US $ 62 billion . Following what was then the largest bank acquisition in history , the Bank of America Corporation was founded . Through a series of mergers and acquisitions , it built upon its commercial banking business by establishing Merrill Lynch for wealth management and Bank of America Merrill Lynch for investment banking in 2008 and 2009 , respectively ( since renamed BofA Securities ) .

  "/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",
