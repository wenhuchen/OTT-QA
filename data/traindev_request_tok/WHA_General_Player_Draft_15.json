  "/wiki/Canada": "Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 million square kilometres ( 3.85 million square miles ) , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area . Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

In August 1973 , the current three-division system of Division I , Division II , and Division III was adopted by the NCAA membership in a special convention . Under NCAA rules , Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to athletes for playing a sport . Division III schools may not offer any athletic scholarships . Generally , larger schools compete in Division I and smaller schools in II and III . Division I football was further divided into I-A and I-AA in 1978 . Subsequently , the term Division I-AAA was briefly added to delineate Division I schools which do not field a football program at all , but that term is no longer officially used by the NCAA . In 2006 , Divisions I-A and I-AA were respectively renamed the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) and Football Championship Subdivision ( FCS ) . Controversially , the NCAA severely caps the benefits that collegiate athletes can receive from their schools .",
