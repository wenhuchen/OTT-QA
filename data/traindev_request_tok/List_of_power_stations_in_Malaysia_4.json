Perak has diverse tropical rainforests and an equatorial climate . The state 's mountain ranges belong to the Titiwangsa Range , which is part of the larger Tenasserim Range connecting Thailand , Myanmar and Malaysia . Perak 's Mount Korbu is the highest point of the range . The discovery of an ancient skeleton in Perak supplied missing information on the migration of Homo sapiens from mainland Asia through Southeast Asia to the Australian continent . Known as Perak Man , the skeleton is dated at around 10,000 years old . An early Hindu or Buddhist kingdom , followed by several other minor kingdoms , existed before the arrival of Islam .",

  "/wiki/Steam_Turbine": "A steam turbine is a device that extracts thermal energy from pressurized steam and uses it to do mechanical work on a rotating output shaft . Its modern manifestation was invented by Charles Parsons in 1884 . The steam turbine is a form of heat engine that derives much of its improvement in thermodynamic efficiency from the use of multiple stages in the expansion of the steam , which results in a closer approach to the ideal reversible expansion process . Because the turbine generates rotary motion , it is particularly suited to be used to drive an electrical generator - about 85% of all electricity generation in the United States in the year 2014 was by use of steam turbines .",
  "/wiki/Palm_oil": "Palm oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp ( reddish pulp ) of the fruit of the oil palms , primarily the African oil palm Elaeis guineensis , and to a lesser extent from the American oil palm Elaeis oleifera and the maripa palm Attalea maripa . The use of palm oil in food products has attracted the concern of environmental activist groups ; the high oil yield of the trees has encouraged wider cultivation , leading to the clearing of forests in parts of Indonesia to make space for oil-palm monoculture . This has resulted in significant acreage losses of the natural habitat of the three surviving species of orangutan . One species in particular , the Sumatran orangutan , has been listed as critically endangered .",

  "/wiki/Biogas": "Biogas is the mixture of gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen ( anaerobically ) , primarily consisting of methane and carbon dioxide . Biogas can be produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste , manure , municipal waste , plant material , sewage , green waste or food waste . Biogas is a renewable energy source . In India , it is also known as Gobar Gas . Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion with methanogen or anaerobic organisms , which digest material inside a closed system , or fermentation of biodegradable materials . This closed system is called an anaerobic digester , biodigester or a bioreactor . Biogas is primarily methane ( CH4 ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , moisture and siloxanes . The gases methane , hydrogen , and carbon monoxide ( CO ) can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen . This energy release allows biogas to be used as a fuel ; it can be used for any heating purpose , such as cooking . It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat . Biogas can be compressed , the same way as natural gas is compressed to CNG , and used to power motor vehicles . In the United Kingdom , for example , biogas is estimated to have the potential to replace around 17% of vehicle fuel .",

The town has an estimated population of 157,330 while the surrounding municipal area has a total population of 396,290 . Before the founding of Sandakan , Sulu Archipelago was the source of dispute between Spain and the Sultanate of Sulu for economic dominance in the region . By 1864 , Spain had blockaded the Sultanate possessions in the Sulu Archipelago . The Sultanate of Sulu awarded a German consular service ex-member a piece of land in the Sandakan Bay to seek protection from Germany . In 1878 , the Sultanate sold north-eastern Borneo to an Austro-Hungarian consul who later left the territory to a British colonial merchant . The German presence over the area raised concern among the British . As a result , a protocol was signed between the British , German and the Spanish to recognise Spanish sovereignty over the Sulu Archipelago , in return for the Spanish not intervening in British affairs in northern Borneo . Sandakan began to prosper when the British North Borneo Company ( BNBC ) started to build a new settlement in 1879 , developing it into an active commercial and trading centre as well as making it the main administrative centre for North Borneo . The British also encouraged the migration of the Chinese from British Hong Kong to develop the economy of Sandakan .",

The World Business Council for Sustainable Development provides a definition : Selected waste and by-products with recoverable calorific value can be used as fuels in a cement kiln , replacing a portion of conventional fossil fuels , like coal , if they meet strict specifications . Sometimes they can only be used after pre-processing to provide tailor-made fuels for the cement process RDF consists largely of combustible components of such waste , as non recyclable plastics ( not including PVC ) , paper cardboard , labels , and other corrugated materials . These fractions are separated by different processing steps , such as screening , air classification , ballistic separation , separation of ferrous and non ferrous materials , glass , stones and other foreign materials and shredding into a uniform grain size , or also pelletized in order to produce a homogeneous material which can be used as substitute for fossil fuels in e.g . cement plants , lime plants , coal fired power plants or as reduction agent in steel furnaces . RDF can be also further specified into e.g . tyre derived fuels ( TDF ) from used tyres , or solid recovered fuels ( SRF ) Others describe the properties , such as :"
