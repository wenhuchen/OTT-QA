  "/wiki/IRAS": "The Infrared Astronomical Satellite ( IRAS ) was the first-ever space telescope to perform a survey of the entire night sky at infrared wavelengths . Following the end of its mission , the 1.1 metric-ton satellite was not deorbited and constitutes a space hazard . Launched on 25 January 1983 , its mission lasted ten months . The telescope was a joint project of the United States ( NASA ) , the Netherlands ( NIVR ) , and the United Kingdom ( SERC ) . Over 250,000 infrared sources were observed at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 micrometer wavelengths . Support for the processing and analysis of data from IRAS was contributed from the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology . Currently , the Infrared Science Archive at IPAC holds the IRAS archive . The success of IRAS led to interest in the 1985 Infrared Telescope ( IRT ) mission on the Space Shuttle , and the planned Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility which eventually transformed into the Space Infrared Telescope Facility , SIRTF , which in turn was developed into the Spitzer Space Telescope , launched in 2003 . The success of early infrared space astronomy led to further missions , such as the Infrared Space Observatory ( 1990s ) and the Hubble Space Telescope 's NICMOS instrument .",

  "/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope": "The Spitzer Space Telescope ( SST ) , formerly the Space Infrared Telescope Facility ( SIRTF ) , was an infrared space telescope launched in 2003 and retired on 30 January 2020 . The planned mission period was to be 2.5 years with a pre-launch expectation that the mission could extend to five or slightly more years until the onboard liquid helium supply was exhausted . This occurred on 15 May 2009 . Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate , most of the instruments were no longer usable . However , the two shortest-wavelength modules of the IRAC camera continued to operate with the same sensitivity as before the cryogen was exhausted , and continued to be used into early 2020 in the Spitzer Warm Mission . During the warm mission , the two short wavelength channels of IRAC operated at 30 K , which was predicted to experience little to no degradation compared to the nominal mission . To ascertain the performance pre-launch tests , as well as tests at the University of Rochester , were conducted and confirmed the performance of the detectors . The Spitzer data , from both the primary and warm phases , are archived at the Infrared Science Archive ( IRSA ) . In keeping with NASA tradition , the telescope was renamed after its successful demonstration of operation , on 18 December 2003 . Unlike most telescopes that are named by a board of scientists , typically after famous deceased astronomers , the new name for SIRTF was obtained from a contest open to the general public . The contest led to the telescope being named in honor of astronomer Lyman Spitzer , who had promoted the concept of space telescopes in the 1940s . Spitzer wrote a 1946 report for RAND Corporation describing the advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory and how it could be realized with available or upcoming technology .",

Herschel was the fourth and final cornerstone mission in the Horizon 2000 programme , following SOHO/Cluster II , XMM-Newton and Rosetta . NASA is a partner in the Herschel mission , with US participants contributing to the mission ; providing mission-enabling instrument technology and sponsoring the NASA Herschel Science Center ( NHSC ) at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center and the Herschel Data Search at the Infrared Science Archive . The observatory was carried into orbit in May 2009 , reaching the second Lagrangian point ( L2 ) of the Earth-Sun system , 1,500,000 kilometres ( 930,000 mi ) from Earth , about two months later . Herschel is named after Sir William Herschel , the discoverer of the infrared spectrum and planet Uranus , and his sister and collaborator Caroline Herschel . The observatory was capable of seeing the coldest and dustiest objects in space ; for example , cool cocoons where stars form and dusty galaxies just starting to bulk up with new stars . The observatory sifted through star-forming clouds - the slow cookers of star ingredients - to trace the path by which potentially life-forming molecules , such as water , form . The telescope 's lifespan was governed by the amount of coolant available for its instruments ; when that coolant ran out , the instruments would stop functioning correctly . At the time of its launch , operations were estimated to last 3.5 years ( to around the end of 2012 ) . It continued to operate until 29 April 2013 15:20 UTC , when Herschel ran out of coolant .",
  "/wiki/Sun": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System . It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma , with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process . It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth . Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers ( 864,000 miles ) , or 109 times that of Earth , and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth . It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System . Roughly three quarters of the Sun 's mass consists of hydrogen ( ~73% ) ; the rest is mostly helium ( ~25% ) , with much smaller quantities of heavier elements , including oxygen , carbon , neon , and iron . The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star ( G2V ) based on its spectral class . As such , it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf ( its light is closer to white than yellow ) . It formed approximately 4.6 billion [ a ] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud . Most of this matter gathered in the center , whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System . The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core . It is thought that almost all stars form by this process .",
  "/wiki/Earth": "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life . According to radiometric dating and other evidence , Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago . Earth 's gravity interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon , which is Earth 's only natural satellite . Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days , a period known as an Earth sidereal year . During this time , Earth rotates about its axis about 366.256 times . [ n 6 ] Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane , producing seasons on Earth . The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides , stabilizes Earth 's orientation on its axis , and gradually slows its rotation . Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets . Earth 's outer layer ( lithosphere ) is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years . About 71% of Earth 's surface is covered with water , mostly by oceans . The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together contain many lakes , rivers and other fresh water , which , together with the oceans , constitute the hydrosphere .

  "/wiki/Lagrangian_point": "In celestial mechanics , the Lagrangian points ( /l\u0259\u02c8\u0261r\u0251\u02d0nd\u0292i\u0259n/ also Lagrange points , L-points , or libration points ) are the points near two large bodies in orbit where a smaller object will maintain its position relative to the large orbiting bodies . At other locations , a small object would go into its own orbit around one of the large bodies , but at the Lagrangian points the gravitational forces of the two large bodies , the centripetal force of orbital motion , and ( for certain points ) the Coriolis acceleration all match up in a way that cause the small object to maintain a stable or nearly stable position relative to the large bodies . There are five such points , labeled L1 to L5 , all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies , for each given combination of two orbital bodies . For instance , there are five Lagrangian points L1 to L5 for the Sun-Earth system , and in a similar way there are five different Lagrangian points for the Earth-Moon system . L1 , L2 , and L3 are on the line through the centers of the two large bodies . L4 and L5 each form an equilateral triangle with the centers of the large bodies . L4 and L5 are stable , which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to the two large bodies . Several planets have trojan satellites near their L4 and L5 points with respect to the Sun . Jupiter has more than a million of these trojans . Artificial satellites have been placed at L1 and L2 with respect to the Sun and Earth , and with respect to the Earth and the Moon . The Lagrangian points have been proposed for uses in space exploration .",
  "/wiki/Wide-field_Infrared_Survey_Explorer": "Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE , observatory code C51 ) is a NASA infrared-wavelength astronomical space telescope launched in December 2009 , and placed in hibernation mode in February 2011 .

  "/wiki/Earth_orbit": "A geocentric orbit or Earth orbit involves any object orbiting the Earth , such as the Moon or artificial satellites . In 1997 NASA estimated there were approximately 2,465 artificial satellite payloads orbiting the Earth and 6,216 pieces of space debris as tracked by the Goddard Space Flight Center . Over 16,291 previously launched objects have decayed into the Earth 's atmosphere . A spacecraft enters orbit when its centripetal acceleration due to gravity is less than or equal to the centrifugal acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity . For a low Earth orbit , this velocity is about 7,800 m/s ( 28,100 km/h ; 17,400 mph ) ; by contrast , the fastest manned airplane speed ever achieved ( excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft ) was 2,200 m/s ( 7,900 km/h ; 4,900 mph ) in 1967 by the North American X-15 . The energy required to reach Earth orbital velocity at an altitude of 600 km ( 370 mi ) is about 36 MJ/kg , which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude . Spacecraft with a perigee below about 2,000 km ( 1,200 mi ) are subject to drag from the Earth 's atmosphere , which decreases the orbital altitude . The rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite 's cross-sectional area and mass , as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere . Below about 300 km ( 190 mi ) , decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days . Once a satellite descends to 180 km ( 110 mi ) , it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere . The escape velocity required to pull free of Earth 's gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about 11,200 m/s ( 40,300 km/h ; 25,100 mph ) ."
