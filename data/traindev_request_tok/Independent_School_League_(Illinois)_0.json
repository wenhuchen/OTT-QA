  "/wiki/Knights": "A knight is a man granted an honorary title of knighthood by a head of state ( including the pope ) or representative for service to the monarch , the church or the country , especially in a military capacity . The background of knighthood can be traced back to the Greek hippeis ( \u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 ) and Roman eques of classical antiquity . In the Early Middle Ages in Europe , knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors . During the High Middle Ages , knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility . By the Late Middle Ages , the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry , a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior . Often , a knight was a vassal who served as an elite fighter , a bodyguard or a mercenary for a lord , with payment in the form of land holdings . The lords trusted the knights , who were skilled in battle on horseback . Knighthood in the Middle Ages was closely linked with horsemanship ( and especially the joust ) from its origins in the 12th century until its final flowering as a fashion among the high nobility in the Duchy of Burgundy in the 15th century . This linkage is reflected in the etymology of chivalry , cavalier and related terms . In that sense , the special prestige accorded to mounted warriors in Christendom finds a parallel in the furusiyya in the Islamic world . In the Late Medieval period , new methods of warfare began to render classical knights in armour obsolete . Yet , the titles remained in many countries .",

  "/wiki/Bobcat": "The bobcat ( Lynx rufus ) is a medium-sized North American cat that first appeared during the Irvingtonian stage around 1.8 million years ago ( AEO ) . Containing two recognized subspecies , it ranges from southern Canada to central Mexico , including most of the contiguous United States . The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas , as well as semidesert , urban edge , forest edge , and swampland environments . It remains in some of its original range , but populations are vulnerable to local extinction ( extirpation ) by coyotes and domestic animals . With a gray to brown coat , whiskered face , and black-tufted ears , the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized genus Lynx . It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx , with which it shares parts of its range , but is about twice as large as the domestic cat . It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped , stubby ( or bobbed ) tail , from which it derives its name . Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares , it hunts insects , chickens , geese and other birds , small rodents , and deer . Prey selection depends on location and habitat , season , and abundance . Like most cats , the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary , although with some overlap in home ranges . It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries , including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces . The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months ."
