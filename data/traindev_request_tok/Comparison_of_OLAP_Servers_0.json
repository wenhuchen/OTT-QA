The ASF was formed from the Apache Group and incorporated on March 25 , 1999 . The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers . The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License and is free and open-source software ( FOSS ) . The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative , consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license . Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project . The ASF is a meritocracy , implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects . The ASF is considered a second generation open-source organization , in that commercial support is provided without the risk of platform lock-in . Among the ASF 's objectives are : to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache projects ; to prevent the Apache brand name from being used by other organizations without permission . The ASF also holds several ApacheCon conferences each year , highlighting Apache projects and related technology .",

  "/wiki/Essbase": "Essbase is a multidimensional database management system ( MDBMS ) that provides a multidimensional database platform upon which to build analytic applications . Essbase , whose name derives from extended spreadsheet database , began as a product of Arbor Software , which merged with Hyperion Software in 1998 . Oracle Corporation acquired Hyperion Solutions Corporation in 2007 , as of 2009 [ update ] Oracle marketed Essbase as Oracle Essbase ( an on-premises product ) and more recently , Essbase is offered as part of the Oracle Analytics Cloud . Until late 2005 IBM also marketed an OEM version of Essbase as DB2 OLAP Server . The database researcher E. F. Codd coined the term on-line analytical processing ( OLAP ) in a whitepaper that set out twelve rules for analytic systems ( an allusion to his earlier famous set of twelve rules defining the relational model ) . This whitepaper , published by Computerworld , was somewhat explicit in its reference to Essbase features , and when it was later discovered that Codd had been sponsored by Arbor Software , Computerworld withdrew the paper . In contrast to on-line transaction processing ( OLTP ) , OLAP defines a database technology optimized for processing human queries rather than transactions . The results of this orientation were that multidimensional databases oriented their performance requirements around a different set of benchmarks ( Analytic Performance Benchmark , APB-1 ) than that of RDBMS ( Transaction Processing Performance Council ( TPC ) ) . Hyperion renamed many of its products in 2005 , giving Essbase an official name of Hyperion System 9 BI+ Analytic Services , but the new name was largely ignored by practitioners . The Essbase brand was later returned to the official product name for marketing purposes , but the server software still carried the Analytic Services title until it was incorporated into Oracle 's Business Intelligence Foundation Suite ( BIFS ) product . In August 2005 , Information Age magazine named Essbase as one of the 10 most influential technology innovations of the previous 10 years , along with Netscape , the BlackBerry , Google , virtualization , Voice Over IP ( VOIP ) , Linux , XML , the Pentium processor , and ADSL . Editor Kenny MacIver said : Hyperion Essbase was the multi-dimensional database technology that put online analytical processing on the business intelligence map .",

  "/wiki/TM1": "IBM Planning Analytics powered by TM1 ( formerly IBM Cognos TM1 , formerly Applix TM1 , formerly Sinper TM/1 ) is a business performance management software suite designed to implement collaborative planning , budgeting and forecasting solutions , interactive what-if analyses , as well as analytical and reporting applications . The database server component of the software platform retains its historical name TM1 . Data is stored in in-memory multidimensional OLAP cubes , generally at the leaf level , and consolidated on demand . In addition to data , cubes can include encoded rules which define any on-demand calculations . By design , computations ( typically aggregation along dimensional hierarchies using weighted summation ) on the data are performed in near real-time , without the need to precalculate , due to a highly performant database design and calculation engine . These properties also allow the data to be updated frequently and by multiple users . TM1 is an example of a class of software products which implement the principles of the functional database model . The IBM Planning Analytics platform , in addition to the TM1 database server , includes an ETL tool , server management and monitoring tools and a number of user front ends which provide capabilities designed for common business planning and budgeting requirements , including workflow , adjustments , commentary , etc . The vendor currently offers the software both as a standalone on-premise product and in the SaaS model on the cloud .",

In the early 1970s , the software was primarily leased to other agricultural departments in order to analyze the effect soil , weather and seed varieties had on crop yields . The project was funded by the National Institutes of Health and later by a coalition of university statistics programs called the University Statisticians of the Southern Experiment Stations . By 1976 the software had 100 customers and 300 people attended the first SAS user conference in Kissimmee , Florida that year . Goodnight , Barr , Sall and another early participant , Jane Helwig , founded SAS Institute Inc. as a private company on July 1 , 1976 , in offices across the street from the university . Barr and Helwig later sold their interest in the company . SAS ' tradition of polling users for suggestions to improve the software through the SASWare Ballot was adopted during its first year of operation . Many of the company 's employee perks , such as fresh fruit , reasonable work hours and free M & M 's every Wednesday became part of the company 's practices that first year . In the late 1970s , the company established its first marketing department . SAS started building its current headquarters in a forested area of Cary , North Carolina in 1980 . Later that year it started providing on-site daycare in order to keep an employee who was planning on being a stay-at-home mom ."
