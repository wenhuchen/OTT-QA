  "/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Tracy": "The Trouble with Tracy is a Canadian television series produced by CTV for the 1970-1971 television season , with intended distribution by the U.S.-based National General Pictures . It is considered by some to be one of the worst situation comedies ever produced . The series was produced as a daily show , and aired weekday afternoons at 3:30 pm from September 14 , 1970 . The economic and time pressures of producing 130 episodes in a single season ( seven shows were filmed every five days ) meant cheap , wobbly sets , no outdoor filming , a laugh track instead of a live studio audience , the use of single takes , the reuse of 25-year-old radio scripts , and other shortcuts that resulted in a poor-quality product . Even flubbed lines and bloopers sometimes ended up airing , because the show could not afford retakes .",
