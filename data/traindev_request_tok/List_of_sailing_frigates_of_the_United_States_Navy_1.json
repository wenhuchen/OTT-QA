  "/wiki/USS_Baltimore_(1798)": "USS Baltimore was a ship of the United States Navy . This 20-gun ship was built in 1798 by Joseph Caverly in Baltimore , Maryland , as Adriana .

In August 1798 the Baltimore was ordered to join the Constellation and convoy a fleet of merchantmen home from Havana , Cuba . Late in 1798 , Baltimore and Constitution were escorting a large convoy to Havana , when the latter sprung her bowsprit and returned home . Baltimore later fell in with two British frigates , on 16 November 1798 , who impressed 55 of her crew ( 50 were returned ) . On his return to the United States , Captain Phillips was dismissed for permitting an outrage to the American flag . The incident also created much anti-British feeling among the Americans . During 1799 Baltimore took two prizes , and the following year three more , as well as recapturing three American vessels which had fallen into French hands . At the close of the Quasi-War with France , she carried the ratified peace treaty to France . Upon her return , Baltimore was sold at Philadelphia in 1801 .",

She was later recommissioned a number of times for service in various theaters , such as in the Mediterranean , in China and in the South Atlantic Ocean . During several instances she served as a role player in American gunboat diplomacy , a role she was well suited for with her large long-range 32-pounder guns and her short-range carronades which produced fragmentation and fire damage to the ship fired upon , as well as splinter and shrapnel injury to its crew .",
  "/wiki/USS_Chesapeake_(1799)": "Chesapeake was a 38-gun wooden-hulled , three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy . She was one of the original six frigates whose construction was authorized by the Naval Act of 1794 . Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young navy 's capital ships . Chesapeake was originally designed as a 44-gun frigate , but construction delays , material shortages and budget problems caused builder Josiah Fox to alter her design to 38 guns . Launched at the Gosport Navy Yard on 2 December 1799 , Chesapeake began her career during the Quasi-War with France and later saw service in the First Barbary War . On 22 June 1807 she was fired upon by HMS Leopard of the Royal Navy for refusing to allow a search for deserters . The event , now known as the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair , angered the American public and government and was a precipitating factor that led to the War of 1812 . As a result of the affair , Chesapeake 's commanding officer , James Barron , was court-martialed and the United States instituted the Embargo Act of 1807 against the United Kingdom . Early in the War of 1812 she made one patrol and captured five British merchant ships . She was captured by HMS Shannon shortly after sailing from Boston , Massachusetts , on 1 June 1813 . The Royal Navy took her into their service as HMS Chesapeake , where she served until she was broken up and her timbers sold in 1819 .

The name Congress was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed.Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young Navy 's capital ships , and so Congress and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than the standard frigates of the period . Her first duties with the newly formed United States Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi War with France and to defeat the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War . During the War of 1812 she made several extended length cruises in company with her sister ship President and captured , or assisted in the capture of twenty British merchant ships . At the end of 1813 , due to a lack of materials to repair her , she was placed in ordinary for the remainder of the war .

The name Constitution was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed . Joshua Humphreys designed the frigates to be the young Navy 's capital ships , and so Constitution and her sister ships were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period . She was built at Edmund Hartt 's shipyard in the North End of Boston , Massachusetts . Her first duties were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi-War with France and to defeat the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War .

The act called for the U.S. to build several ships-of-the-line and several new frigates , of which Cumberland was to be one . Money issues , however , prevented Cumberland from being finished in a timely manner . It was not until Secretary of the Navy Abel Parker Upshur came to office that the ship was finished . A war scare with Britain led Upshur to order the completion of several wooden sailing ships and for the construction of new steam powered ships . Designed by famed American designer William Doughty , Cumberland was one a series of frigates in a class called the Raritan-class . The design borrowed heavily from older American frigate designs such as Constitution and Chesapeake . Specifically , Doughty liked the idea of giving a frigate more guns than European designs called for . As a result , he called for Cumberland and her sister ships to have a fully armed spar deck , along with guns on the gun deck .",
