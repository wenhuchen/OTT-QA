Johnnie Walker is a brand name and the owners have a long history of tournament sponsorship . They also sponsored the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles which was a European Tour event played in Scotland . The event was originally called the Johnnie Walker Asian Classic . There was a tournament already called the Johnnie Walker Classic in Australia , but when that event ceased in 1992 , the word Asian was dropped from the name . In 1989 Johnnie Walker sponsored the Hong Kong Open , and it was decided to establish an additional tournament which it would sponsor on an ongoing basis . This tournament was called the Johnnie Walker Asian Classic , and was first staged in Hong Kong in 1990 . Subsequently , it became a touring event , essentially used by its sponsor as a marketing exercise in the Asia Pacific region . In 1992 it became the first event to be sanctioned by the European Tour in East Asia ( the Dubai Desert Classic was the first in Asia as a whole ) . In 1993 the word Asian was dropped from the title . In 2005 the tournament was held in China for the first time , as part of the European Tour 's push into China , which saw four events held in mainland China and one in Hong Kong in the 2005 season . The location of the tournament changes every year .",
  "/wiki/Thailand": "Thailand , [ a ] officially the Kingdom of Thailand and formerly known as Siam , [ b ] is a country at the centre of the Southeast Asian Indochinese Peninsula composed of 76 provinces . At 513,120 km2 ( 198,120 sq mi ) and over 68 million people , Thailand is the world 's 50th-largest country by total area and the 21st-most-populous country . The capital and largest city is Bangkok , a special administrative area . Thailand is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos , to the east by Laos and Cambodia , to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia , and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the southern extremity of Myanmar . Its maritime boundaries include Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast , and Indonesia and India on the Andaman Sea to the southwest . It is a unitary state . Although nominally the country is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy , the most recent coup , in 2014 , established a de facto military dictatorship under a junta . Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century ; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the exonym Siamese dates to the 12th century . Various Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon kingdoms , Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region , competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang , Sukhothai , Lan Na and Ayutthaya , which rivaled each other . Documented European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya , now one of the great powers in the region . Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan Narai 's reign ( 1656-1688 ) , gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the 1767 Burmese-Siamese War . Taksin ( r. 1767-1782 ) quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom .",

Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

The first event was held in January 2000 at the Houghton Golf Club in Johannesburg , and replaced the South African PGA Championship on the European Tour calendar . In 2004 , the tournament was rescheduled to December , resulting in two events being staged that year . Following this change , the Alfred Dunhill Championship has formed part of the following year 's European Tour season . In addition , the event was moved to the Leopard Creek Country Club , just south of the Kruger National Park in Malalane , Mpumalanga . The Dunhill Championship should not be confused with the Dunhill Links Championship , a much richer European Tour event with the same sponsor which is played in Scotland .

It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics .",

Singapore is located about one degree ( 137 kilometres or 85 miles ) north of the equator , and is situated off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula , and by extension , the southernmost extremity of continental Asia . The island country shares its southern maritime border with Indonesia 's Riau Islands , its northern , western , and eastern maritime borders with the Johor state of Peninsular Malaysia , and is in the vicinity of Sumatra to its west and Borneo to its east . It is enveloped by the littoral waters of the Johore Strait to its north and the Singapore Strait to its south , and is geographically positioned within the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans , being bounded by the Malacca Strait to its west and the South China Sea to its east . The country 's territory is composed of one main island and 58 smaller islets , the combined area of which has increased by almost 25% since the country 's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects . Although Singapore has been a constituent part of several Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empires and Islamic sultanates throughout its millennia-long history , modern Singapore , then part of the erstwhile Johor Sultanate , was founded in 1819 when Stamford Raffles , a British colonial officer , established a trading post of the East India Company on the island . In 1824 , the island and its satellite islets were fully ceded by the Johor Sultanate , and in 1826 , Singapore was incorporated into the Straits Settlements , a group of East India Company territories in the Malay peninsula . From 1830 to 1858 , the Straits Settlements were administered as a Malayan subdivision of the East India Company 's Bengal Presidency ; following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the Presidency and its constituent Settlements were reorganised into the British Raj . In 1867 , Britain 's colonial holdings in the Malay archipelago were separated from British India , and the administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from Calcutta to London , bringing the Straits Settlements under the direct control of the British Crown as a crown colony . From 1867 to the 1940s , Singapore grew into a successful entrep\u00f4t that attracted settlers and sojourners from the region and beyond . During the Second World War , Imperial Japan successfully invaded Singapore , resulting in an interregnum of British rule corresponding with a brief Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 . Following Japan 's surrender in 1945 , the Straits Settlements were dissolved , with Singapore being returned to British control as a standalone crown colony in 1946 .",

Human occupation of the present UAE has been traced back to the emergence of anatomically modern humans from Africa some 125,000 BCE through finds at the Faya-1 site in Mleiha , Sharjah . Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais . Known as Magan to the Sumerians , the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the Umm Al Nar period , which traded between the Indus Valley , Bahrain and Mesopotamia as well as Iran , Bactria and the Levant . The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba . The UAE 's long history of trade led to the emergence of Julfar , in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah , as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area .",

In 2013 , Stenson won the U.S. PGA Tour 's FedEx Cup and the European Tour 's Race to Dubai , thus becoming the first player to win both , and to do so in the same season , a historic double . Stenson described his feat as a double-double because in the process of winning these two seasonal points crowns , he also won the season finales of both tours .",
  "/wiki/Deutsche_Bank_-_SAP_Open_TPC_of_Europe": "The Deutsche Bank Players Championship of Europe was an annual 72-hole stroke play professional golf tournament for men . It was last played in Germany and was part of the European Tour schedule . The tournament was founded in 1992 as the Honda Open and acquired the tag of The Players Championship of Europe or TPC of Europe in 1995 . It was last played at Gut Kaden . The prize fund in 2007 was \u20ac3.6 million , which put it in the top group of European Tour events outside the major championships and World Golf Championships , but not at the head of the list . The parallels between this tournament and the PGA Tour 's Players Championship are not very strong . The European Players Championship was not the richest event on the European Tour and it was not played close to the Tour 's headquarters . The Players Championship 's closest parallel in Europe is perhaps the BMW PGA Championship , although that was originally the British PGA Championship , and thus equivalent to the PGA Championship , organised by the PGA of America , which is a major championship and is now a European Tour event . Before it was attached to the event in Germany , the TPC/Players Championship tag was applied briefly to European Tour events in England and Portugal . It was more of a marketing tool than a genuine indication that the event is different from other leading European Tour events in any important way . Tiger Woods has played in the tournament several times . He was said to have received large appearance fees , which give rise to some controversy as appearance fees are not normally paid by European Tour events which actually take place in Europe .",

Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity . A region named Germania was documented before AD 100 . Beginning in the 10th century , German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire . During the 16th century , northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation . After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire , the German Confederation was formed in 1815 . The German revolutions of 1848-49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights ."
