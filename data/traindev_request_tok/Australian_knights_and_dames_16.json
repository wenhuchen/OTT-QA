After playing cricket for Eton College , he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler , albeit one who was often injured . After leaving university , Allen played mainly for Middlesex . He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly . A change of career allowed him to play more cricket , and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team . He made his debut in 1930 , and remained in contention for a place , when he was available to play , for the rest of the decade . During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932-33 , Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates . From 1933 , Allen worked in the London Stock Exchange , which limited the amount of cricket he could play . Even so , he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936-37 tour of Australia , when the home team won 3-2 having lost the first two matches .",

In 1627 , the first permanent settlers arrived from England , and it became an English and later British colony .
