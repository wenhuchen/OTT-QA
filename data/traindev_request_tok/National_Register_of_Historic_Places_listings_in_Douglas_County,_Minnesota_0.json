  "/wiki/Alexandria,_Minnesota": "Alexandria is a city in and the county seat of Douglas County , Minnesota . First settled in 1858 , it was named after brothers Alexander and William Kinkead from Maryland . The form of the name alludes to Alexandria , Egypt , a center of learning and civilization . The village of Alexandria was incorporated February 20 , 1877 . Its city charter was adopted in 1908 , and it was incorporated as a city in 1909 . W. E. Hicks was pivotal to the town 's early development . He purchased the townsite in 1868 and established a mill , hotel , newspaper , and store . He donated property for a courthouse , jail , and two churches : Methodist and Congregational . The population was 11,070 as of the 2010 census . Alexandria is near Interstate 94 , along Minnesota State Highways 27 and 29 . It is ten miles south of Lake Carlos State Park . In 2013 , Alexandria was named a Top 10 Best Small Town by the Livability website .",
  "/wiki/Carnegie_library": "A Carnegie library is a library built with money donated by Scottish-American businessman and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie . A total of 2,509 Carnegie libraries were built between 1883 and 1929 , including some belonging to public and university library systems . 1,689 were built in the United States , 660 in the United Kingdom and Ireland , 125 in Canada , and others in Australia , South Africa , New Zealand , Serbia , Belgium , France , the Caribbean , Mauritius , Malaysia , and Fiji . At first , Carnegie libraries were almost exclusively in places where he had a personal connection - namely his birthplace in Scotland and the Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania area , his adopted home-town . Yet , beginning in the middle of 1899 , Carnegie substantially increased funding to libraries outside these areas . In later years few towns that requested a grant and agreed to his terms were refused . By the time the last grant was made in 1919 , there were 3,500 libraries in the United States , nearly half of them built with construction grants paid by Carnegie .",

It drew upon the principles of French neoclassicism , but also incorporated Gothic and Renaissance elements , and used modern materials , such as iron and glass . It was an important style in France until the end of the 19th century . It also had a strong influence on architecture in the United States , because of the many prominent American architects who studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts , including Henry Hobson Richardson , John Galen Howard , Daniel Burnham , and Louis Sullivan . :76",
  "/wiki/Woodland_period": "In the classification of archaeological cultures of North America , the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spanned a period from roughly 1000 BCE to European contact in the eastern part of North America , with some archaeologists distinguishing the Mississippian period , from 1000 CE to European contact as a separate period . The term Woodland Period was introduced in the 1930s as a generic term for prehistoric sites falling between the Archaic hunter-gatherers and the agriculturalist Mississippian cultures . The Eastern Woodlands cultural region covers what is now eastern Canada south of the Subarctic region , the Eastern United States , along to the Gulf of Mexico . This period is variously considered a developmental stage , a time period , a suite of technological adaptations or traits , and a family tree of cultures related to earlier Archaic cultures . It can be characterized as a chronological and cultural manifestation without any massive changes in a short time but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools , leather crafting , textile manufacture , cultivation , and shelter construction . Many Woodland peoples used spears and atlatls until the end of the period , when they were replaced by bows and arrows ; however , Southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns . The most cited technological distinction of this period was the widespread use of pottery ( although pottery manufacture had arisen during the Archaic period in some places ) , and the diversification of pottery forms , decorations , and manufacturing practices . The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex , consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation , also meant that groups became less mobile over time and , in some times and places , people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities . Intensive agriculture characterizes the Mississippian period from c. 1000-1400 CE and may have continued up to European contact , around 500 years ago .",

  "/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration": "The Works Progress Administration ( WPA ; renamed in 1939 as the Work Projects Administration ) was an American New Deal agency , employing millions of job-seekers ( mostly unskilled men ) to carry out public works projects , including the construction of public buildings and roads . It was established on May 6 , 1935 , by Executive Order 7034 . In one project , Federal Project Number One , the WPA employed musicians , artists , writers , actors and directors in large arts , drama , media , and literacy projects . The five projects dedicated to these were : the Federal Writers Project ( FWP ) , the Historical Records Survey ( HRS ) , the Federal Theatre Project ( FTP ) , the Federal Music Project ( FMP ) , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) . In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets . Thus , under the leadership of the WPA , more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built , in addition to many airports and much housing . The largest single project of the WPA was the Tennessee Valley Authority , which provided the impoverished Tennessee Valley with dams and waterworks to create an infrastructure for electrical power .",
  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 as the Great Northern Passenger Depot . The Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad reached Alexandria in 1878 . The Great Northern Railway promoted Alexandria as a tourist destination , with brochures and attractive fares , and the growing tourist traffic made it necessary to replace the original wood-frame depot . The new depot was built more ornately than the usual depots , which were executed from standardized plans developed by the railroads . The Alexandria depot had mosaic tile floors , birch woodwork , enameled brick wainscoting , and comfortable furniture , and it was located conveniently next to a nearby park . The new depot was one of the largest and most ornate along the Great Northern line in Minnesota . The Alexandria depot was an active passenger station until 1967 . Freight service continued until 1976 , at which point the depot was shuttered .

Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1939 . It responded to needs for relief , reform , and recovery from the Great Depression . Major federal programs and agencies included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . They provided support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly . The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply . New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the 3 Rs : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels , and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional [ clarification needed ] Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and non-whites and ethnic whites . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth and liberals in support .

  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes . Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures , including entrance gateways , hotels and lodges , park roads and bridges , visitor centers , trail shelters , informational kiosks , and even mundane maintenance and support facilities . Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",

This was similar to the Dawes Act of 1887 , which had applied to Native American lands in the Indian Territory .",
  "/wiki/Renaissance_Revival_architecture": "Renaissance Revival architecture ( sometimes referred to as Neo-Renaissance ) is a group of 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Greek Revival nor Gothic Revival but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes . Under the broad designation Renaissance architecture nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Renaissance humanism ; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque . Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century : Neo-Renaissance might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called Italianate , or when many French Baroque features are present ( Second Empire ) . The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe , particularly in France and Italy , has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture . A comparison between the breadth of its source material , such as the English Wollaton Hall , Italian Palazzo Pitti , the French Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord , and the Russian Palace of Facets - all deemed Renaissance - illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take ."
