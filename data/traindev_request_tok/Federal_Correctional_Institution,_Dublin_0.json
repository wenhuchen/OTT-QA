His flamboyant methods of yellow journalism influenced the nation 's popular media by emphasizing sensationalism and human interest stories . Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 with Mitchell Trubitt after being given control of The San Francisco Examiner by his wealthy father . Moving to New York City , Hearst acquired the New York Journal and fought a bitter circulation war with Joseph Pulitzer 's New York World . Hearst sold papers by printing giant headlines over lurid stories featuring crime , corruption , sex , and innuendo . Acquiring more newspapers , Hearst created a chain that numbered nearly 30 papers in major American cities at its peak . He later expanded to magazines , creating the largest newspaper and magazine business in the world . Hearst controlled the editorial positions and coverage of political news in all his papers and magazines , and thereby often published his personal views . He sensationalized Spanish atrocities in Cuba while calling for war in 1898 against Spain . Historians reject his claims that he started the war with Spain . He was twice elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives . He ran unsuccessfully for President of the United States in 1904 , Mayor of New York City in 1905 and 1909 , and for Governor of New York in 1906 .",

  "/wiki/Perjury": "Perjury is the intentional act of swearing a false oath or falsifying an affirmation to tell the truth , whether spoken or in writing , concerning matters material to an official proceeding . [ A ] In some jurisdictions , contrary to popular misconception , no crime has occurred when a false statement is ( intentionally or unintentionally ) made while under oath or subject to penalty . Instead , criminal culpability attaches only at the instant the declarant falsely asserts the truth of statements ( made or to be made ) that are material to the outcome of the proceeding . For example , it is not perjury to lie about one 's age except if age is a fact material to influencing the legal result , such as eligibility for old age retirement benefits or whether a person was of an age to have legal capacity . Perjury is considered a serious offense , as it can be used to usurp the power of the courts , resulting in miscarriages of justice . In the United States , for example , the general perjury statute under federal law classifies perjury as a felony and provides for a prison sentence of up to five years . The California Penal Code allows for perjury to be a capital offense in cases causing wrongful execution . Perjury which caused the wrongful execution of another or in the pursuit of causing the wrongful execution of another is respectively construed as murder or attempted murder , and is normally itself punishable by execution in countries that retain the death penalty . Perjury is considered a felony in most U.S. states as well as most Australian states . In Queensland , under Section 124 of the Queensland Criminal Code Act 1899 , perjury is punishable by up to life in prison if it is committed to procure an innocent person for a crime that is punishable by life in prison . However , prosecutions for perjury are rare . In some countries such as France and Italy , suspects can not be heard under oath or affirmation and so can not commit perjury , regardless of what they say during their trial .",
  "/wiki/Superfund": "The United States federal Superfund law is officially known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation , and Liability Act of 1980 ( CERCLA ) . The federal Superfund program , administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) is designed to investigate and clean up sites contaminated with hazardous substances . Sites managed under this program are referred to as Superfund sites . There are 40,000 federal Superfund sites across the country , and approximately 1,600 of those sites have been listed on the National Priorities List ( NPL ) . Sites on the NPL are considered the most highly contaminated and undergo longer-term remedial investigation and remedial action ( cleanups ) . The EPA seeks to identify parties responsible for hazardous substances releases to the environment ( polluters ) and either compel them to clean up the sites , or it may undertake the cleanup on its own using the Superfund ( a trust fund ) and seek to recover those costs from the responsible parties through settlements or other legal means . Approximately 70% of Superfund cleanup activities historically have been paid for by the potentially responsible parties ( PRPs ) , the latter reflecting the polluter pays principle . However , 30% of the time the responsible party either can not be found or is unable to pay for the cleanup . In these circumstances , taxpayers pay for the cleanup . Through the 1980s , most of the funding came from a tax passed on to the consumers of petroleum and chemical products . However , in 1995 , Congress chose not to renew this tax and the burden of the cost was shifted to tax payers . Since 2001 , most of the cleanup of hazardous waste sites has been funded through taxpayers generally .",

  "/wiki/Tax_evasion": "Tax evasion is the illegal evasion of taxes by individuals , corporations , and trusts . Tax evasion often entails taxpayers deliberately misrepresenting the true state of their affairs to the tax authorities to reduce their tax liability and includes dishonest tax reporting , such as declaring less income , profits or gains than the amounts actually earned , or overstating deductions . Tax evasion is an activity commonly associated with the informal economy . One measure of the extent of tax evasion ( the tax gap ) is the amount of unreported income , which is the difference between the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authorities and the actual amount reported . In contrast , tax avoidance is the legal use of tax laws to reduce one 's tax burden .

  "/wiki/Money_laundering": "Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions . The overall scheme of this process returns the money to the launderer in an obscure and indirect way . One problem of criminal activities is accounting for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies . Considerable time and effort may be put into strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion . Implementing such strategies is generally called money laundering . After money has been laundered , it can be used for legitimate purposes . Law enforcement agencies of many jurisdictions have set up sophisticated systems in an effort to detect suspicious transactions or activities , and many have set up international cooperative arrangements to assist each other in these endeavors . The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) estimates that The estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is 2-5% of global GDP , or $ 800 billion - $ 2 trillion in current US dollars . In a number of legal and regulatory systems , the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime , and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system ( involving things such as securities , digital currencies , credit cards , and traditional currency ) , including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions . Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering ( which is concerned with source of funds ) with terrorism financing ( which is concerned with destination of funds ) when regulating the financial system . Some countries treat obfuscation of sources of money as also constituting money laundering , whether it is intentional or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations . Other countries define money laundering in such a way as to include money from activity that would have been a crime in that country , even if the activity was legal where the actual conduct occurred .",

  "/wiki/SUV": "Sport utility vehicle ( SUV ) is a category of motor vehicles that combine elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles , such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive . There is no commonly agreed definition of an SUV , and usage varies between countries . Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light truck chassis ; however , broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV . A crossover SUV is defined as an SUV built with a unibody construction ( as per passenger cars ) , however in many cases crossovers are simply referred to as SUVs . In some countries - such as the United States - SUVs have been classified as light trucks , resulting in more lenient regulations compared to passenger cars . The predecessors to SUVs date back to military and low-volume models from the late 1930s , and the four-wheel drive station wagons and carryalls that began to be introduced in 1949 . The 1984 Jeep Cherokee ( XJ ) is considered to be the first SUV in the modern style . Most SUVs produced today use unibody construction ( as per passenger cars ) ; however , in the past many SUVs used body-on-frame construction . During the late 1990s and early 2000s , the popularity of SUVs greatly increased , often at the expense of the popularity of large sedans and station wagons . More recently , smaller SUVs , mid-size and crossovers have become increasingly popular . SUVs are currently the world 's largest automotive segment and accounted for 36.8% of the world 's passenger car market in 2017 . SUVs are criticised for their impact on other road users and the environment .",

If a person survives , there may be long-term neurological problems . Toxic cyanide-containing compounds include hydrogen cyanide gas and a number of cyanide salts . Poisoning is relatively common following breathing in smoke from a house fire . Other potential routes of exposure include workplaces involved in metal polishing , certain insecticides , the medication nitroprusside , and certain seeds such as those of apples and apricots . Liquid forms of cyanide can be absorbed through the skin . Cyanide ions interfere with cellular respiration , resulting in the body 's tissues being unable to use oxygen . Diagnosis is often difficult . It may be suspected in a person following a house fire who has a decreased level of consciousness , low blood pressure , or high blood lactate .",
