However , Volume 6 's disclaimer states that it is not suitable for children , as opposed to Volumes 3-5 stating that they may not be suitable for children . This is due to that in addition to containing cartoons that have racial and/or ethnic stereotypes ( like in Volumes 3 , 4 , and 5 ) and references to sexism in Robert McKimson 's Wild Wife , Volume 6 also contains many cartoons that pertain to World War II , most of them containing depictions or references to Adolf Hitler and Hideki Tojo or to Nazis and Imperial Japan in general .

Volume 6 was originally only released in North America due to the poor sales of Volume 5 . However , the discs in this volume were not region-coded , making it easy for collectors outside of North America to import and play this set .",

The two men and Sidney sold the studio to Taft Broadcasting on December 29 , 1966 . By the mid-1980s , when the profitability of Saturday-morning cartoons was eclipsed by weekday afternoon syndication , Hanna-Barbera 's fortunes had declined . Turner Broadcasting System purchased the studio from Taft ( by then renamed Great American Broadcasting ) in late 1991 and used much of its back catalog as the foundation and programming for Cartoon Network and later Boomerang . After Turner purchased the company , Hanna and Barbera continued to serve as creative consultants and mentors . The studio became a subsidiary of Warner Bros . Animation in 1996 following Turner 's merger with Time Warner and was ultimately absorbed into Warner Bros . Animation in 2001 , existing in name only . As of 2020 , Warner Bros. continues to produce new animation based on Hanna-Barbera 's catalog using the Hanna-Barbera brand name .",
