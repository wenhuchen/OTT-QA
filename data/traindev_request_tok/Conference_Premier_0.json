In the Middle Ages , Barrow was a small hamlet within the parish of Dalton-in-Furness with Furness Abbey , now on the outskirts of the modern-day town , controlling the local economy before its dissolution in 1537 . The iron prospector Henry Schneider arrived in Furness in 1839 and , with other investors , opened the Furness Railway in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast . Further hematite deposits were discovered , of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel . For a period of the late 19th century , the Barrow Hematite Steel Company-owned steelworks was the world 's largest . Barrow 's location and the availability of steel allowed the town to develop into a significant producer of naval vessels , a shift that was accelerated during World War I and the local yard 's specialisation in submarines . The original iron- and steel-making enterprises closed down after World War II , leaving Vickers shipyard as Barrow 's main industry and employer .
