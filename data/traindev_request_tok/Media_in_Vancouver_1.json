  "/wiki/Sports_radio": "Sports radio ( or sports talk radio ) is a radio format devoted entirely to discussion and broadcasting of sporting events . A widespread programming genre that has a narrow audience appeal , sports radio is characterized by an often-boisterous on-air style and extensive debate and analysis by both hosts and callers . Many sports talk stations also carry play-by-play ( live commentary ) of local sports teams as part of their regular programming . Hosted by Bill Mazer , the first sports talk radio show in history launched in March 1964 on New York 's WNBC ( AM ) . Soon after WNBC launched its program , in 1965 Seton Hall University 's radio station , WSOU , started Hall Line , a call-in sports radio talk show focusing on the team 's basketball program . Having celebrated its 50th anniversary on air during the 2015-2016 season , Hall Line , which broadcasts to central and northern New Jersey as well as all five boroughs of New York , is the oldest and longest running sports talk call-in show in the NY-NJ Metropolitan area , and is believed to be the oldest in the nation . Enterprise Radio Network became the first national all-sports network , operating out of Avon , Connecticut , from New Year 's Day 1981 through late September of that year before going out of business . ER had two channels , one for talk and a second for updates and play-by-play . ER 's talk lineup included current New York Yankees voice John Sterling , New York Mets radio host Ed Coleman and former big-league pitcher Bill Denehy . Sports talk is available in local , network and syndicated forms , is available in multiple languages , and is carried in multiple forms on both major North American satellite radio networks . In the United States , most sports talk-formatted radio stations air syndicated programming from ESPN Radio , SB Nation Radio , Sports Byline USA , Fox Sports Radio , CBS Sports Radio , or NBC Sports Radio , while in the Spanish language , ESPN Deportes Radio is the largest current network . In contrast , Canadian sports talk stations may carry a national brand ( such as TSN Radio or Sportsnet Radio ) but carry mostly local programming , with American-based shows filling in gaps .",

  "/wiki/Talk_radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music . Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual , and often feature interviews with a number of different guests . Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation , usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who call in ( usually via telephone ) to the show . Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments . Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk ( increasingly known as progressive talk ) and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio , starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of live Internet website streaming and podcasts . Now , it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station . In addition , TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further . Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios , but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as TuneIn , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher and time-shifting services like DAR.fm .",

Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists . Campus radio supported U2 and REM Many campus radio stations carry a variety of programming including news ( often local ) , sports ( often relating to the campus ) , and spoken word programming as well as general music .

Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms , folk lyrics , and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , steel guitars ( such as pedal steels and dobros ) , and fiddles as well as harmonicas . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . According to Lindsey Starnes , the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . In 2009 in the United States , country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are found in the folk music of working class Americans and/or blue-collar American life , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional English ballads , cowboy songs , and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants .",
