  "/wiki/Watt-peak_AC": "The nominal power is the nameplate capacity of photovoltaic ( PV ) devices , such as solar cells , panels and systems , and is determined by measuring the electric current and voltage in a circuit , while varying the resistance under precisely defined conditions . These Standard Test Conditions ( STC ) are specified in standards such as IEC 61215 , IEC 61646 and UL 1703 ; specifically the light intensity is 1000 W/m2 , with a spectrum similar to sunlight hitting the earth 's surface at latitude 35\u00b0N in the summer ( airmass 1.5 ) , the temperature of the cells being 25 \u00b0C . The power is measured while varying the resistive load on the module between an open and closed circuit ( between maximum and minimum resistance ) . The highest power thus measured is the 'nominal ' power of the module in watts . This nominal power divided by the light power that falls on a given area of a photovoltaic device ( area \u00d7 1000 W/m2 ) defines its efficiency , the ratio of the device 's electrical output to the incident energy . The nominal power is important for designing an installation in order to correctly dimension its cabling and converters . If the available area is limited the solar cell efficiency and with it the nominal power per area ( e.g . kW/m2 ) is also relevant . For comparing modules , the price per nominal power ( e.g . $ /W ) is relevant . For a given installation 's physical orientation and location the expected annual production ( e.g . kWh ) per annual production assuming nominal power i.e .",

It is in the North American Southwest , primarily within southeastern California and southern Nevada , and it occupies 47,877 sq mi ( 124,000 km2 ) . Small areas also extend into Utah and Arizona . Its boundaries are generally noted by the presence of Joshua trees , which are native only to the Mojave Desert and are considered an indicator species , and it is believed to support an additional 1,750 to 2,000 species of plants . The central part of the desert is sparsely populated , while its peripheries support large communities such as Las Vegas , Barstow , Lancaster , Palmdale , Victorville , and St. George . The Mojave Desert is bordered by the Great Basin Desert to its north and the Sonoran Desert to its south and east . Topographical boundaries include the Tehachapi Mountains and the Sierra Pelona Ridge to the west , the Sierra Nevada and the Inyo Mountains to the northwest , and the San Gabriel Mountains and San Bernardino Mountains to the south . The mountain boundaries are distinct because they are outlined by the two largest faults in California - the San Andreas and Garlock faults . The Mojave Desert displays typical basin and range topography . Higher elevations above 2,000 ft ( 610 m ) in the Mojave are commonly referred to as the High Desert ; however , Death Valley is the lowest elevation in North America at 280 ft ( 85 m ) below sea level and is one of the Mojave Desert 's harshest climates and best known places . Large parts of the Mojave Desert are often referred to as the high desert , in contrast to the low desert , the Sonoran Desert to the south .
