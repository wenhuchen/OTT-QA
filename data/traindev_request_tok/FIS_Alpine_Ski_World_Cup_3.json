The overall titles were won by Marcel Hirscher of Austria and Tina Maze of Slovenia . A break in the schedule was for the biennial World Championships , held 4-17 February in Schladming , Austria . Changes for the 2013 season included the awarding of World Cup points for the slalom crystal globe for the limited field city events ( parallel slalom ) , not just in the overall standings . Also , a crystal globe trophy was no longer awarded for the combined event , as many organizers considered the event difficult to market , but its results still counted in the overall rankings . Maze became the first Slovenian to win an overall World Cup title ; she clinched it on 24 February after her eighth victory of the season , a super-combined race at M\u00e9ribel , France . Her victory in a downhill race at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany on 2 March gave her wins in all five disciplines for the season , and she became the first racer in World Cup history to score more than 2,000 points in a single season . The previous record of 2,000 points was held by Hermann Maier , set during the 2000 season . Maze broke various statistical records in this season , including the highest number of podiums in a season ( 24 , record previously held by Maier ( 22 ) and by Hanni Wenzel and Pernilla Wiberg for ladies ( 18 ) ) , highest number of top 5 finishes ( 31 , previously Maier and Wiberg ( 24 ) ) , highest number of points after first 10 races ( 677 , previously Katja Seizinger , 643 ) , largest percent of possible points won ( 69% , previously 61% by Wiberg ) , and the highest margin over the runner-up ( 1313 , compared to 743 for Maier and 578 for Lindsey Vonn ) .

She is also the only woman to remain at the top of the overall standings throughout the season - a feat previously achieved only by Bode Miller in 2005 .

  "/wiki/1969_Alpine_Skiing_World_Cup": "The 3rd World Cup season began in December 1968 and concluded in March 1969 .

Gertrude Gabl of Austria won the women 's overall title . For the first and only ( as of 2016 ) time in World Cup history , a discipline trophy was shared by more than two people , as four men ( 3 French , 1 Austrian ) tied for the Men 's Slalom trophy .

  "/wiki/1980_Alpine_Skiing_World_Cup": "The 14th World Cup season began in December 1979 in France and concluded in March 1980 in Austria . Andreas Wenzel of Liechtenstein edged out Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden for the men 's overall title . Wenzel 's older sister , Hanni Wenzel , won the women 's overall title for the second time , making them the first sibling combination to both win the overall World Cup title ( as of 2017 , joined only by Janica and Ivica Kosteli\u0107 from Croatia ) and the only one to win in the same year . The World Cup race scoring system was revised again , the third different system used in less than a year . The new system was a Top 15 points system ( ranging from 25 points for first , 20 for second , 15 for third , 12 for fourth , and 1 point less for each subsequent position down to 1 point for 15th ) . This system remained in effect through 1991 . The season championship for the Combined discipline also returned this year , for the first time since 1976 . A break in the schedule in February was for the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid , New York , U.S.A . This was the final time that the Winter Olympics also served as the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships ; the World Championships would become a separate competition held in odd-numbered years beginning in 1985 .",

  "/wiki/1975_Alpine_Skiing_World_Cup": "The 9th World Cup season began in December 1974 in France and concluded in March 1975 in Italy . Gustav Th\u00f6ni of Italy would regain the overall title , his fourth overall title in five seasons . Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll of Austria won the women 's overall title , her fifth consecutive . Three major changes took place on the World Cup circuit this season . First , Alpine combined races were recognized as World Cup events for the first time ; both the men 's and women 's seasons included three combined races , all of which were won by the overall winners ( Th\u00f6ni and Moser-Pr\u00f6ll ) ; in fact , Th\u00f6ni 's three combined wins were directly responsible for his edging out Ingemar Stenmark for the title . Second , a parallel slalom race was held at the end of the season , as parallel slalom had become popular on the professional skiing tour due to the visible head-to-head competition . Although parallel slalom skiing was used a few more times in World Cup competition , beginning in 1976 it became a permanent part of the season-ending Nations Cup events . Third , and more importantly , the new head of the International Olympic Committee , Lord Killanin , reached a compromise to preserve the amateur status of skiers receiving endorsements , manufacturer 's fees , and other payments , as long as the payments were made to the skier 's national association or Olympic committee and not directly to the skier , that also eliminated the prohibition on year-round training and competition in a sport . While further criticism of this rule , known as Olympics Rule 26 , would continue and would lead to future problems , such as the banning of World Cup champions Stenmark and Hanni Wenzel from the 1984 Winter Olympics , the immediate impact of this change was to check the steady migration of World Cup skiers to the professional circuit . Partially as a result , World Cup races this season took place in Europe , North America , and Asia .",
