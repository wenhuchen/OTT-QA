In the 9th century external Arabic writers described Gao as an important regional power , and by the end of the 10th century , the local ruler was said to be a Muslim . Towards the end of the 13th century Gao became part of the Mali Empire , but in first half of the 15th century the town regained its independence and with the conquests of Sunni Ali ( ruled 1464-1492 ) it became the capital of the Songhai Empire . The Empire collapsed after the Moroccan invasion in 1591 and the invaders chose to make Timbuktu their capital . By the time of Heinrich Barth 's visit in 1854 , Gao had declined to become an impoverished village with 300 huts constructed from matting . In 2009 , the urban commune had a population of 86,633 . On 31 March 2012 , Gao was captured from Malian government forces by National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad ( MNLA ) and Ansar Dine rebels .
