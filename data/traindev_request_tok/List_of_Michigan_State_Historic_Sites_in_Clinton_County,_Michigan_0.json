Prior to his timed explosives going off at the Bath Consolidated School school building , Kehoe had murdered his wife , Nellie Price Kehoe , and firebombed his farm . Arriving at the site of the school explosion , Kehoe died when he detonated explosives concealed in his truck . Kehoe , the 55-year-old school board treasurer , was angered by increased taxes and his defeat in the April 5 , 1926 election for township clerk . He was thought to have planned his murderous revenge after that public defeat . Kehoe had a reputation for difficulty on the school board and in personal dealings . In addition , he was notified that his mortgage was going to be foreclosed upon in June 1926 . For much of the next year , Kehoe purchased explosives and secretly planted them on his property and under the school . Kehoe murdered Nellie Kehoe some time between her being discharged from a hospital on May 16 and before the bombings two days later . He detonated incendiary explosives on his homestead on the morning of the 18th , causing the house and other farm buildings to be destroyed by the explosives ' blasts and subsequent fires . Almost simultaneously to the explosions and fire at the Kehoe farm , an explosion ripped through the north wing of the Bath Consolidated School building , killing 36 schoolchildren and two teachers .",
