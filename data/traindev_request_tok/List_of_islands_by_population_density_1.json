Taipei is the capital and largest metropolitan area . Other major cities include Kaohsiung , Taichung , Tainan and Taoyuan . With 23.7 million inhabitants , Taiwan is among the most densely populated states , and is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations ( UN ) . Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago . In the 17th century , Dutch rule opened the island to mass Han immigration . After the brief Kingdom of Tungning in parts of the southern and western areas of the island , the island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China , and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895 . Following the surrender of Japan in 1945 , the Republic of China , which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911 , took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies . The resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the loss of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of China , since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands .",

Adam 's Bridge , a land connection to the Indian mainland , is now mostly submerged with only a chain of limestone shoals remaining above sea level . According to temple records , this natural causeway was formerly complete , but was breached by a violent storm ( probably a cyclone ) in 1480 . The formation is also known as Rama 's Bridge , as according to Hindu mythology , it was constructed during the rule of Lord Rama . Sri Lanka 's climate includes tropical monsoons : the northeast monsoon ( December to March ) , and the southwest monsoon ( June to October ) .
