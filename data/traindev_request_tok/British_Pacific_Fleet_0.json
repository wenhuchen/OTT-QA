  "/wiki/Supermarine_Seafire": "The Supermarine Seafire was a naval version of the Supermarine Spitfire adapted for operation from aircraft carriers . It was analogous in concept to the Hawker Sea Hurricane , a navalised version of the Spitfire 's stablemate , the Hawker Hurricane . The name Seafire had been derived from the abbreviation of the longer name Sea Spitfire . The idea of adopting a navalised carrier-capable version of the Supermarine Spitfire had been mooted by the Admiralty as early as May 1938 . Despite a pressing need to replace various types of obsolete aircraft that were still in operation with the Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) , some opposed the notion , such as Winston Churchill , although these disputes were often a result of an overriding priority being placed on maximising production of land-based Spitfires instead . During 1941 and early 1942 , the concept was again pushed for by the Admiralty , culminating in an initial batch of Seafire Mk Ib fighters being provided in late 1941 , which were mainly used for pilots to gain experience operating the type at sea . While there were concerns over the low strength of its undercarriage , which had not been strengthened like many naval aircraft would have been , its performance was found to be acceptable . From 1942 onwards , further Seafire models were quickly ordered , including the first operationally-viable Seafire F Mk III variant . This led to the type rapidly spreading throughout the FAA . In November 1942 , the first combat use of the Seafire occurred during Operation Torch , the Allied landings in North Africa . In July 1943 , the Seafire was used to provide air cover for the Allied invasion of Sicily ; and reprised this role in September 1943 during the subsequent Allied invasion of Italy . During 1944 , the type was again used in quantity to provide aerial support to Allied ground forces during the Normandy landings and Operation Dragoon in Southern France .",

  "/wiki/Fairey_Barracuda": "The Fairey Barracuda was a British carrier-borne torpedo and dive bomber designed by Fairey Aviation . It was the first aircraft of this type operated by the Royal Navy 's Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) to be fabricated entirely from metal . The Barracuda was developed as a replacement for the Fairey Albacore biplanes . Development was protracted due to the original powerplant intended for the type , the Rolls-Royce Exe , being cancelled ; it was replaced by the less powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engine . On 7 December 1940 the first Fairey prototype conducted its maiden flight ; early testing revealed it to be somewhat underpowered . However , the definitive Barracuda Mk II had a more powerful model of the Merlin engine , while later versions were powered by the larger and even more powerful Rolls-Royce Griffon engine . The type was ordered in bulk to equip the FAA ; in addition to Fairey 's own production line , Barracudas were also built by Blackburn Aircraft , Boulton Paul , and Westland Aircraft . The type participated in numerous carrier operations during the conflict , being deployed in the Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea , and the Pacific Ocean against the Germans , Italians , and Japanese respectively during the latter half of the war . One of the Barracuda 's most noteworthy engagements was a large-scale attack upon the German battleship Tirpitz on 3 April 1944 . In addition to the FAA , the Barracuda was also used by the Royal Air Force , the Royal Canadian Navy , the Dutch Naval Aviation Service and the French Air Force . Following its withdrawal from service during the 1950s , no intact examples of the Barracuda were preserved despite its once-large numbers , although the Fleet Air Arm Museum has ambitions to assemble a full reproduction .",

The initial invasion of Okinawa on April 1 , 1945 , was the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific Theater of World War II . The 82-day battle lasted from April 1 until June 22 , 1945 . After a long campaign of island hopping , the Allies were planning to use Kadena Air Base on the large island of Okinawa as a base for Operation Downfall , the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands , 340 mi ( 550 km ) away . The United States created the Tenth Army , a cross-branch force consisting of the 7th , 27th , 77th , and 96th infantry divisions of the US Army with the 1st , 2nd , and 6th divisions of the Marine Corps , to fight on the island . The Tenth was unique in that it had its own tactical air force ( joint Army-Marine command ) , and was also supported by combined naval and amphibious forces . The battle has been referred to as the typhoon of steel in English , and tetsu no ame ( rain of steel ) or tetsu no b\u014df\u016b ( violent wind of steel ) in Japanese . The nicknames refer to the ferocity of the fighting , the intensity of Japanese kamikaze attacks , and the sheer numbers of Allied ships and armored vehicles that assaulted the island . The battle was one of the bloodiest in the Pacific , with approximately 160,000 casualties on both sides : at least 75,000 Allied and 84,166-117,000 Japanese , including drafted Okinawans wearing Japanese uniforms . 149,425 Okinawans were killed , committed suicide or went missing , a significant proportion of the estimated pre-war 300,000 local population . In the naval operations surrounding the battle , both sides lost considerable numbers of ships and aircraft , including the Japanese battleship Yamato .

  "/wiki/Rabaul": "Rabaul is a township in East New Britain province , on the island of New Britain , in the country of Papua New Guinea . It lies about 600 kilometres to the east of the island of New Guinea . Rabaul was the provincial capital and most important settlement in the province until it was destroyed in 1994 by falling ash from a volcanic eruption in its harbor . During the eruption ash was sent thousands of metres into the air , and the subsequent rain of ash caused 80% of the buildings in Rabaul to collapse . After the eruption the capital was moved to Kokopo , about 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) away . Rabaul is continually threatened by volcanic activity because it is on the edge of the Rabaul caldera , a flooded caldera of a large pyroclastic shield . Rabaul was planned and built around the harbor area known as Simpsonhafen ( Simpson Harbour ) during the German New Guinea administration which controlled the region between 1884 and formally through 1919 . From 1910 Rabaul was the headquarters of German New Guinea until it was captured by the British Empire during the early days of World War I . It became the capital of the Australian mandated Territory of New Guinea until 1937 , when it was first destroyed by a volcano . During World War II it was captured by Japan in 1942 , and became its main base of military and naval activity in the South Pacific . Settlements and military installations around the edge of the caldera are often collectively called Rabaul , although the old town of Rabaul was reduced to practical insignificance by the volcanic eruption in 1937 . As a tourist destination , Rabaul is popular for its volcanoes , scuba diving and for snorkeling sites , spectacular harbour and other scenery , World War II history , flora and fauna , and the cultural life of the Tolai people .",

  "/wiki/Fairey_Firefly": "The Fairey Firefly was a Second World War-era carrier-borne fighter aircraft and anti-submarine aircraft principally operated by the Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) . It was developed and built by the British aircraft manufacturer Fairey Aviation Company . Development of the Firefly can be traced back to pair of specifications issued by the British Air Ministry in 1938 , calling for new naval fighter designs . Designed to the contemporary FAA concept of a two-seat fleet reconnaissance/fighter , the pilot and navigator/weapons officer were positioned at separate stations . In flight , the Firefly was superior in terms of both performance and firepower to its predecessor , the Fairey Fulmar . Due to a protracted development , the type only entered operational service towards the end of the conflict , at which point it was no longer competitive as a fighter . The limitations of a single engine in a relatively heavy airframe reduced its performance , but the Firefly proved to be fairly sturdy , long-ranged , and docile aircraft during carrier operations . The Fairey Firefly served in the Second World War as a fleet fighter . During the post-war era , it was soon superseded in the fighter role by the arrival of more modern jet aircraft , thus the Firefly was adapted to perform in other roles , including strike operations and anti-submarine warfare . In these capacities , it remained a mainstay of the FAA until the mid-1950s . Both British and Australian Fireflies routinely performed ground-attack operations from various aircraft carriers during the Korean War . In foreign service , the type was in operation with the naval air arms of Australia , Canada , India and the Netherlands .",
