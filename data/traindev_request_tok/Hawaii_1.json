Situated in the western Pacific Ocean , it consists of about 7,641 islands that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south : Luzon , Visayas and Mindanao . The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City , both part of Metro Manila . Bounded by the South China Sea on the west , the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest , the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north , Japan to the northeast , Vietnam to the west , Palau to the east , and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south . The Philippines ' location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons , but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world 's greatest biodiversity . The Philippines is the world 's 5th largest island country with an area of 300,000 km2 ( 120,000 sq mi ) . As of 2015 , it had a population of at least 100 million . As of January 2018 [ update ] , it is the eighth-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world . Approximately 10 million additional Filipinos lived overseas , comprising one of the world 's largest diasporas . Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands . In prehistoric times , Negritos were some of the archipelago 's earliest inhabitants . They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples .",

Ireland has been inhabited for about 12,500 years according to archaeological studies ( see Prehistoric Ireland ) . For most of Ireland 's recorded history , the Irish have been primarily a Gaelic people ( see Gaelic Ireland ) . From the 9th century , small numbers of Vikings settled in Ireland , becoming the Norse-Gaels . Anglo-Normans conquered parts of Ireland in the 12th century , while England 's 16th/17th-century ( re ) conquest and colonisation of Ireland brought many English and Lowland Scots people to parts of the island , especially the north . Today , Ireland is made up of the Republic of Ireland ( an independent state ) and the smaller Northern Ireland ( a part of the United Kingdom ) . The people of Northern Ireland hold various national identities including British , Irish , Northern Irish or some combination thereof . The Irish have their own customs , language , music , dance , sports , cuisine and mythology . Although Irish ( Gaeilge ) was their main language in the past , today most Irish people speak English as their first language . Historically , the Irish nation was made up of kin groups or clans , and the Irish also had their own religion , law code , alphabet and style of dress . There have been many notable Irish people throughout history .

In contrast to Ireland , surveys since the 1970s have shown consistent majorities or pluralities of Americans who self-identify as being of Irish ancestry as also self-identifying as being Protestant , and are actually mostly Scotch-Irish , the American descendants of Ulster Protestants ( mostly Ulster Scots ) who emigrated from Ireland to the United States . Three million people separately self-identified as Scotch-Irish , but demographers have long assumed the U.S. Census Bureau self-identification estimate of the Scotch-Irish to be a serious undercount ( in part , because along with English and other British ancestries , many Scotch-Irish self-identify as being of American ancestry ) . While some argue that the Scotch-Irish should be considered Irish , considering that conversions by Irish Catholics during the Reformation in Ireland to Protestant churches were historically rare , and that intermarriage between Protestants and Catholics in both Ireland and in the United States was also historically rare [ list 1 ] while interethnic and interdenominational marriage amongst Protestants in Ulster was relatively common , [ list 2 ] multiple historians have argued instead that the Scotch-Irish distinction remains necessary as the Ulster Protestants remain a distinct ethnoreligious group from the Irish Catholics .

  "/wiki/English_people": "The English people are a nation and an ethnic group native to England who speak the English language . The English identity is of early medieval origin , when they were known in Old English as the Angelcynn ( family of the Angles ) . Their ethnonym is derived from the Angles , one of the Germanic peoples who migrated to Great Britain around the 5th century AD . England is the largest and most populous country of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , and the majority of people living there are British citizens . The English largely descend from two main historical population groups - the earlier Celtic Britons ( or Brythons ) and the Germanic tribes who settled in Britain following the withdrawal of the Romans : the Angles , Saxons , Jutes and Frisians . Collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons , they founded what was to become the Kingdom of England ( from the Old English Englaland ) by the early 10th century , in response to the invasion and minor settlement of Danes beginning in the late 9th century . This was followed by the Norman Conquest and limited settlement of Anglo-Normans in England in the latter 11th century . In the Acts of Union 1707 , the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland merged to become the Kingdom of Great Britain . Over the years , English customs and identity have become fairly closely aligned with British customs and identity in general . The English people are the source of the English language , the Westminster system , the common law system and numerous major sports such as cricket , football , rugby union , rugby league and tennis . These and other English cultural characteristics have spread worldwide , in part as a result of the former British Empire .",

Demographers regard the reported number of English Americans as a serious undercount , as the index of inconsistency is high and many if not most Americans from English stock have a tendency to identify simply as Americans or if of mixed European ancestry , identify with a more recent and differentiated ethnic group . In the 1980 Census , over 49 million ( 49,598,035 ) Americans claimed English ancestry . At 26.34% , this was the largest group amongst the 188 million people who reported at least one ancestry . The population was 226 million which would have made the English ancestry group 22% of the total . Scotch-Irish Americans are for the most part descendants of Lowland Scots and Northern English ( specifically - County Durham , Cumberland , Northumberland and Yorkshire ) settlers who colonized Ireland during the Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century . In 1982 , an opinion poll showed respondents a card listing a number of ethnic groups and asked , Thinking both of what they have contributed to this country and have gotten from this country , for each one tell me whether you think , on balance , they 've been a good or a bad thing for this country . The English were the top ethnic group , with 66% saying they were a good thing for the United States , followed by the Irish at 62% . Ben J. Wattenberg argues that this poll demonstrates a general American bias against Hispanics and other recent immigrant populations .

Korea is bordered by Russia to the northeast , China to the northwest , and neighbours Japan to the east via the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan ( East Sea ) . During the first half of the 1st millennium , Korea was divided between the three competing states of Goguryeo , Baekje , and Silla , together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea . In the second half of the 1st millennium , Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo , leading to the Unified Silla period . Meanwhile , Balhae formed in the north , superseding former Goguryeo . Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war , ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms . Toward the end of the 1st millennium , Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo , which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state . Around the same time , Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo .

The 1870s were followed by the greatest surge of immigration , which occurred between 1880 and 1914 and brought more than 4 million Italians to the United States , the greatest number coming from Southern Italy ( namely Campania , Apulia , Basilicata , Calabria and Sicily ) , areas which were still largely rural and agricultural , and where much of the populace had been impoverished by centuries of foreign misrule , and an oppressive taxation system imposed after Italian unification in 1861 . This period of large-scale immigration ended abruptly with the onset of the First World War in 1914 and , except for one year ( 1922 ) , never fully resumed . Further immigration was greatly limited by several laws Congress passed in the 1920s . Following the unification , the unitary Italian state initially encouraged emigration to relieve economic pressures in the South . After the American Civil War , which resulted in over a half million killed or wounded , immigrant workers were recruited from Italy and elsewhere to fill the labor shortage caused by the war . In the United States , most Italians began their new lives as manual laborers in eastern cities , mining camps and farms . The descendants of the Italian immigrants gradually rose from a lower economic class in the first generation to a level comparable to the national average by 1970 .",
  "/wiki/Africa": "Africa is the world 's second-largest and second-most populous continent , after Asia . At about 30.3 million km2 ( 11.7 million square miles ) including adjacent islands , it covers 6% of Earth 's total surface area and 20% of its land area . With 1.3 billion people as of 2018 , it accounts for about 16% of the world 's human population . The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north , the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast , the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west . The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos . It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states ( countries ) , four territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition . The majority of the continent and its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere , with a substantial portion and number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere . Africa 's average population is the youngest amongst all the continents ; the median age in 2012 was 19.7 , when the worldwide median age was 30.4 . Algeria is Africa 's largest country by area , and Nigeria is its largest by population . Africa , particularly central Eastern Africa , is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade ( great apes ) , as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors as well as later ones that have been dated to around 7 million years ago , including Sahelanthropus tchadensis , Australopithecus africanus , A. afarensis , Homo erectus , H. habilis and H. ergaster - the earliest Homo sapiens ( modern human ) , found in Ethiopia , date to circa 200,000 years ago . Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas ; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones . Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities , cultures and languages .",
  "/wiki/African_American": "African Americans ( also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans ) are an ethnic group of Americans with total or partial ancestry from any of the black racial groups of Africa . The phrase generally refers to descendants of enslaved black people who are from the United States . African Americans constitute the third largest ethnic group and the second largest racial group in the US , after White Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans . Most African Americans are descendants of enslaved peoples within the boundaries of the present United States . On average , African Americans are of West/Central African and European descent , and some also have Native American ancestry . According to U.S. Census Bureau data , African immigrants generally do not self-identify as African American . The overwhelming majority of African immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities ( \u224895% ) . Immigrants from some Caribbean , Central American , and South American nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term . African-American history starts in the 16th century , with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as slaves to Latin America , and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English colonies in North America . After the founding of the United States , black people continued to be enslaved , and the last four million black slaves were only liberated after the Civil War in 1865 . Due to notions of white supremacy , they were treated as second-class citizens . The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only , and only white men who owned property could vote .",

[ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) . France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Other major urban areas include Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Lille and Nice . France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia . West Francia , which became the Kingdom of France in 987 , emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , following its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) .",
  "/wiki/French_American": "French Americans or Franco-Americans ( French : Franco-Am\u00e9ricains ) are citizens or nationals of the United States who identify themselves with having full or partial French or French Canadian heritage , ethnicity , and/or ancestral ties . The state with the largest proportion of people identifying as having French ancestry is Maine , while the state with the largest number of people with French ancestry is California . Many U.S. cities have large French American populations . The city with the largest concentration of people of French extraction is Madawaska , Maine , while the largest French-speaking population by percentage of speakers in the U.S. is found in St. Martin Parish , Louisiana . Country-wide , there are about 10.4 million U.S. residents who declare French ancestry or French Canadian descent , and about 1.32 million speak French at home as of 2010 census . An additional 750,000 U.S. residents speak a French-based creole language , according to the 2011 American Community Survey . While Americans of French descent make up a substantial percentage of the American population , Franco-Americans are arguably less visible than other similarly sized ethnic groups . This is in part due to the tendency of Franco-American groups to identify more closely with North American regional identities such as French Canadian , Acadian , Brayon , Cajun , or Louisiana Creole than as a coherent group . This has inhibited the development of a unified French American identity as is the case with other European American ethnic groups .",

  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",

Scottish Americans are closely related to Scotch-Irish Americans , descendants of Ulster Scots , and communities emphasize and celebrate a common heritage . The majority of Scotch-Irish Americans originally came from Lowland Scotland and Northern England before migrating to the province of Ulster in Ireland ( see Plantation of Ulster ) and thence , beginning about five generations later , to North America in large numbers during the eighteenth century . Large-scale emigration from Scotland to America began in the 1700s , accelerating after the Jacobite rising of 1745 , the resulting breakup of the clan structures , and the Highland Clearances . Displaced Scots went in search of a better life and settled in the thirteen colonies , initially around South Carolina and Virginia , and then further in successive generations ."
