After initial success through utilization of established wrestling stars of the 1980s , the company appointed Eric Bischoff to executive producer of television in 1993 . Under Bischoff 's leadership , the company enjoyed a period of mainstream success characterized by a shift to reality-based storylines , and notable hirings of former WWF talent .

The Pacific Northwest was considered one of the main pro wrestling territories from the 1960s to the 1980s . Portland Wrestling was forced to close its doors in July 1992 . The closure came as a result of a slowdown in the wrestling business during the early 1990s , a declaration of bankruptcy by Portland Wrestling 's main television sponsor , and negative fallout from a shift in regulatory emphasis by the Oregon Athletic Commission . The telecasts , which originated on Portland station KPTV , ended in December 1991 and were replaced on KPTV by syndicated WWF programming . Portland Wrestling 's referee Sandy Barr purchased the company from the Owen family in 1992 and continued the tradition of professional wrestling in the Pacific Northwest under the name Championship Wrestling USA . A new wrestling promotion emerged in 2000 , calling itself Portland Wrestling and claiming to be a restart of the original Pacific Northwest/Portland Wrestling . It stressed a title lineage ( through Len Denton ) to the old NWA PNW Championships . Unlike the Don Owen promotion , the new incarnation of Portland Wrestling was not an NWA member .",

Many wrestlers had left with Baba , with many more joining the following year when JWA folded . From the mid-1970s , All Japan was firmly established as the largest promotion in Japan . As the 90s began , aging stars gave way to a younger generation including Mitsuharu Misawa , Kenta Kobashi , Toshiaki Kawada and Akira Taue , leading to perhaps AJPW 's most profitable period in the 1990s . In 1999 , Giant Baba died and the promotion was ran by Motoko Baba . Misawa was named President but left in 2000 after disagreements with Motoko . Misawa created Pro Wrestling NOAH and every single native wrestler besides Masanobu Fuchi and Toshiaki Kawada left All Japan . This led to a loss of All Japan 's TV deal and a period of hardship for the company . In 2001 , they entered a cross-promotion agreement with New Japan Pro-Wrestling which proved very successful , allowing All Japan to remain one of the larger promotions in the country , although now firmly behind NJPW . In January 2002 , Misawa left . By mid-2005 , All Japan 's attendance had dropped and the promotion seemed to be in trouble again but by 2007 had new sponsors and seemed to have recovered . After Misawa and most of the other wrestlers left the promotion , there was a lull in developing new stars until the likes of KAI , Suwama , Hama and T28 debuted from the mid-2000s onward and helped restrengthen the company .",
