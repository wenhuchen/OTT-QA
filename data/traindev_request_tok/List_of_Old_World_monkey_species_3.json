He is known as the father of modern taxonomy . Many of his writings were in Latin , and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us ( after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9 ) . Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730 . He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738 , where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands . He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala . In the 1740s , he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals . In the 1750s and 1760s , he continued to collect and classify animals , plants , and minerals , while publishing several volumes . He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death . Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message : Tell him I know no greater man on earth . Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote : With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza , I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly .",
  "/wiki/Black-shanked_douc": "The black-shanked douc ( Pygathrix nigripes ) is an endangered species of douc found mostly in the forests of eastern Cambodia , with some smaller populations in Vietnam . This species is unique among the doucs in having a largely greyish-blue face . No global population estimate exists , although the Wildlife Conservation Society report an estimated 23,000 individuals present in Cambodia 's Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary . Prior to the discovery of the significance of this population , the largest populations were believed to be in adjacent Vietnam , where the largest known population is around 500-600 individuals . They are primarily arboreal and their diet consists on leaves , of which they obtain most of their water .",

  "/wiki/Golden_snub-nosed_monkey": "The golden snub-nosed monkey ( Rhinopithecus roxellana ) is an Old World monkey in the subfamily Colobinae . It is endemic to a small area in temperate , mountainous forests of central and Southwest China . They inhabit these mountainous forests of Southwestern China at elevations of 1,500-3,400 m above sea level . The Chinese name is Sichuan golden hair monkey ( \u56db\u5ddd\u91d1\u4e1d\u7334 ) . It is also widely referred to as the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey . Of the three species of snub-nosed monkeys in China , the golden snub-nosed monkey is the most widely distributed throughout China . Snow occurs frequently within its range and it can withstand colder average temperatures than any other non-human primates . Its diet varies markedly with the seasons , but it is primarily a herbivore with lichens being its main food source . It is diurnal and largely arboreal , spending some 97% of its time in the canopy . There are three subspecies . Population estimates range from 8,000 to 15,000 and it is threatened by habitat loss .",
  "/wiki/Black_snub-nosed_monkey": "The black snub-nosed monkey ( Rhinopithecus bieti ) , also known as the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey , is a large black and white primate that lives only in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan , where it is known to the locals as the Yunnan golden hair monkey ( \u6ec7\u91d1\u4e1d\u7334 ) and the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey ( \u9ed1\u767d\u4ef0\u9f3b\u7334 ) . The common name , black snub-nosed monkey , is issued to Rhinopithecus strykeri , inhabiting in Northern Sino-Myanmar border . Coniferous and deciduous forests in the mountainous regions of Yunnan are the ideal terrain for these primates . It is threatened by habitat loss , and is considered an endangered species . With their unique adaptations to their environment , these monkeys thrive at extreme altitudes despite the below freezing temperatures and thin air . This primate 's diet is mainly made up of the large amounts of lichens available in their region . Recent studies have provided more information on the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey , but there is still much to learn about them .",

It is a black and white monkey with a pink nose and lips and blue patches around the eyes . It is found at altitudes of 200 to 1,200 m ( 700 to 3,900 ft ) on fragmentary patches of forest on craggy limestone areas . First described in 1912 , the monkey was rediscovered in 1990 but is exceedingly rare . In 2008 , fewer than 250 individuals were thought to exist , and the species was the subject of intense conservation effort . The main threats faced by these monkeys are habitat loss and hunting , and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the species as critically endangered .",

In 1906 he travelled to France , Spain and Tangier on a collecting trip . In 1915 , he published results of his studies of casts of specimens associated with the Piltdown Man , concluding that the jaw actually came from a fossil ape and that the skullcap came from a modern human . He was awarded the 1934 Leidy Award from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia ."
