  "/wiki/Reality_television": "Reality television is a genre of television programming that documents purportedly unscripted real-life situations , often starring unknown individuals rather than professional actors . Reality television came to prominence in the late 1990s and the early 2000s with the global successes of the series Survivor , Idols , and Big Brother , all of which became global franchises . Reality television shows tend to be interspersed with confessionals , short interview segments in which cast members reflect on or provide context for the events being depicted on-screen . Competition-based reality shows typically feature gradual elimination of participants , either by a panel of judges or by the viewership of the show . Documentaries , television news , sports television , talk shows , and traditional game shows are generally not classified as reality television . Some genres of television programming that predate the reality television boom have been retroactively classified as reality television , including hidden camera shows , talent-search shows , documentary series about ordinary people , high-concept game shows , home improvement shows , and court shows featuring real-life cases . Reality television has faced significant criticism since its rise in popularity . Critics argue that reality television shows do not accurately reflect reality , in ways both implicit ( participants being placed in artificial situations ) , and deceptive ( misleading editing , participants being coached on behavior , storylines generated ahead of time , scenes being staged ) . Some shows have been accused of rigging the favorite or underdog to win . Other criticisms of reality television shows include that they are intended to humiliate or exploit participants ; that they make stars out of untalented people unworthy of fame , infamous figures , or both ; and that they glamorize vulgarity .",

  "/wiki/Video_on_demand": "Video on demand ( VOD ) is a video media distribution system that allows users to access video entertainment without a traditional video entertainment device and without the constraints of a typical static broadcasting schedule . In the 20th century , broadcasting in the form of over-the-air programming was the commonest form of media distribution . As Internet and IPTV technologies continued to develop in the 1990s , consumers began to gravitate towards non-traditional modes of content consumption , which culminated in the arrival of VOD on televisions and personal computers . Unlike broadcast television , VOD systems initially required each user to have an Internet connection with considerable bandwidth to access each system 's content . In 2000 , the Fraunhofer Institute IIS developed the JPEG2000 codec , which enabled the distribution of movies via Digital Cinema Packages . This technology has since expanded its services from feature-film production to include broadcast television and has resulted in lower bandwidth requirements for VOD applications . Disney , Paramount , Sony , Universal and Warner Bros. subsequently launched the Digital Cinema Initiative , in 2002 . Television VOD systems can stream content , either through a traditional set-top box or through remote devices such as computers , tablets , and smartphones . VOD users can permanently download content to a device such as a computer , digital video recorder or a portable media player for continued viewing . The majority of cable and telephone company-based television providers offer VOD streaming , whereby a user selects a video program that begins to play immediately or downloading to a digital video recorder ( DVR ) rented or purchased from the provider , or to a PC or to a portable device for delayed viewing . Internet television has emerged as an increasingly popular medium of VOD provision . Desktop client applications such as the Apple iTunes online content store and Smart TV apps such as Amazon Prime Video allow temporary rentals and purchases of video entertainment content .",

  "/wiki/Magic_(illusion)": "Magic , which encompasses the subgenres of illusion , stage magic , and close up magic , is a performing art in which audiences are entertained by tricks or illusions of seemingly impossible feats using natural means . It is to be distinguished from paranormal magic which are effects claimed to be created through supernatural means . It is one of the oldest performing arts in the world .

  "/wiki/Illusion": "An illusion is a distortion of the senses , which can reveal how the human brain normally organizes and interprets sensory stimulation . Though illusions distort our perception of reality , they are generally shared by most people . Illusions may occur with any of the human senses , but visual illusions ( optical illusions ) are the best-known and understood . The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses . For example , individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words . Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes during perception . These assumptions are made using organizational principles ( e.g. , Gestalt theory ) , an individual 's capacity for depth perception and motion perception , and perceptual constancy . Other illusions occur because of biological sensory structures within the human body or conditions outside the body within one 's physical environment . The term illusion refers to a specific form of sensory distortion . Unlike a hallucination , which is a distortion in the absence of a stimulus , an illusion describes a misinterpretation of a true sensation . For example , hearing voices regardless of the environment would be a hallucination , whereas hearing voices in the sound of running water ( or another auditory source ) would be an illusion .",
