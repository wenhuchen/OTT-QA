  "/wiki/Luzia_Woman": "Luzia Woman ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ lu\u02c8zi.\u0250 ] ) is the name for an Upper Paleolithic period skeleton of a Paleo-Indian woman who was found in a cave in Brazil . Some archaeologists believed the young woman may have been part of the first wave of immigrants to South America . The 11,500-year-old skeleton was found in a cave in the Lapa Vermelha archeological site in Pedro Leopoldo , in the Greater Belo Horizonte region of Brazil , in 1974 by archaeologist Annette Laming-Emperaire . The nickname Luzia was chosen in homage to the Australopithecus fossil Lucy . The fossil was kept at the National Museum of Brazil , where it was shown to the public until it was fragmented during a fire that destroyed the museum on September 2 , 2018 . On October 19 , 2018 , it was announced that most of Luzia 's remains were identified from the Museu Nacional debris , which allowed them to rebuild part of her skeleton .",
  "/wiki/Paleo-Indian": "Paleo-Indians , Paleoindians or Paleoamericans , were the first peoples who entered , and subsequently inhabited , the Americas during the final glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period . The prefix paleo- comes from the Greek adjective palaios ( \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 ) , meaning old or ancient . The term Paleo-Indians applies specifically to the lithic period in the Western Hemisphere and is distinct from the term Paleolithic . Traditional theories suggest that big-animal hunters crossed the Bering Strait from North Asia into the Americas over a land-and-ice bridge ( Beringia ) . This bridge existed from 45,000 to 12,000 BCE ( 47,000-14,000 BP ) . Small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers migrated alongside herds of large herbivores far into Alaska . From c. 16,500 - c. 13,500 BCE ( c. 18,500 - c. 15,500 BP ) , ice-free corridors developed along the Pacific coast and valleys of North America . This allowed animals , followed by humans , to migrate south into the interior of the continent . The people went on foot or used primitive boats along the coastline . The precise dates and routes of the peopling of the New World remain subjects of ongoing debate . At least two morphologically different Paleo-Indian populations were coexisting in different geographical areas of Mexico 10,000 years ago . Stone tools , particularly projectile points and scrapers , are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas .",

CHG ancestry was also found as represented in ancient DNA , in a Upper Palaeolithic specimen from Satsurblia cave ( dated ca . 11000 BC ) , and in a Mesolithic one from Kotias Klde cave , in western Georgia ( dated ca . 6000 BC ) . The CHG lineage descended from a population that split off the base Western Eurasian lineage very early , around 45,000 years ago , pre-dating the split that led to differentiated populations that descended separately to Ust'-Ishim man , Oase1 and European hunter-gatherers . The Caucasus hunter-gatherers managed to survive in isolation through the Last Glacial Maximum as a distinct population . Eastern Hunter-Gatherers are believed to have received admixture from CHGs , leading to the formation of Western Steppe Herders ( WSHs ) . WSHs formed the Yamnaya culture and expanded massively throughout Europe during the Early Neolithic and Early Bronze Age . The 2015 study by Jones et al . analysed Eurasian steppe ancestry - which is associated with the Ancient North Eurasian lineage - among modern European populations , which is linked to the Indo-European expansion . In comparison to modern human populations , the Satsurblia individual is closest to modern populations from the South Caucasus .",

  "/wiki/European_Mesolithic": "In Old World archaeology , Mesolithic ( Greek : \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 , mesos middle ; \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 , lithos stone ) is the period between the Upper Paleolithic and the Neolithic . The term Epipaleolithic is often used synonymously , especially for outside northern Europe , and for the corresponding period in the Levant and Caucasus . The Mesolithic has different time spans in different parts of Eurasia . It refers to the final period of hunter-gatherer cultures in Europe and Western Asia , between the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and the Neolithic Revolution . In Europe it spans roughly 15,000 to 5,000 BP ; in Southwest Asia ( the Epipalaeolithic Near East ) roughly 20,000 to 8,000 BP . The term is less used of areas further east , and not at all beyond Eurasia and North Africa . The type of culture associated with the Mesolithic varies between areas , but it is associated with a decline in the group hunting of large animals in favour of a broader hunter-gatherer way of life , and the development of more sophisticated and typically smaller lithic tools and weapons than the heavy chipped equivalents typical of the Paleolithic . Depending on the region , some use of pottery and textiles may be found in sites allocated to the Mesolithic , but generally indications of agriculture are taken as marking transition into the Neolithic . The more permanent settlements tend to be close to the sea or inland waters offering a good supply of food . Mesolithic societies are not seen as very complex , and burials are fairly simple ; in contrast , grandiose burial mounds are a mark of the Neolithic .",

It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) .

  "/wiki/British_Mesolithic": "Several species of humans have intermittently occupied Britain for almost a million years . The Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD is conventionally regarded as the end of Prehistoric Britain and the start of recorded history in the island , although some historical information is available from before then . The earliest evidence of human occupation around 900,000 years ago is at Happisburgh on the Norfolk coast , with stone tools and footprints probably made by Homo antecessor . The oldest human fossils , around 500,000 years old , are of Homo heidelbergensis at Boxgrove in Sussex . Until this time Britain had been permanently connected to the Continent by a chalk ridge between south-east England and northern France called the Weald-Artois Anticline , but during the Anglian Glaciation around 425,000 years ago a megaflood broke through the ridge , creating the English Channel , and after that Britain became an island when sea levels rose during interglacials . Fossils of very early Neanderthals dating to around 400,000 years ago have been found at Swanscombe in Kent , and of classic Neanderthals about 225,000 years old at Pontnewydd in Wales . Britain was unoccupied by humans between 180,000 and 60,000 years ago , when Neanderthals returned . By 40,000 years ago they had become extinct and modern humans had reached Britain . But even their occupations were brief and intermittent due to a climate which swung between low temperatures with a tundra habitat and severe ice ages which made Britain uninhabitable for long periods . The last of these , the Younger Dryas , ended around 11,700 years ago , and since then Britain has been continuously occupied . Britain and Ireland were then joined to the Continent , but rising sea levels cut the land bridge between Britain and Ireland by around 11,000 years ago . A large plain between Britain and Continental Europe , known as Doggerland , persisted much longer , probably until around 5600 BC .",

It is one of the most complete ancient skeletons ever found . Radiocarbon tests on bone have shown it to date from 8.9k to 9k calibrated years before present , but it was not until 2013 that Ancient DNA analysis techniques had improved enough to shed light on the remains . In June 2015 , it was announced that Kennewick Man had most genetic similarity among living peoples to Native Americans , including those in the Columbia River region where the skeleton was found . The discovery led to considerable controversy for more than a decade . The Umatilla people and other tribes demanded the remains returned for reburial under the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act ( NAGPRA ) . The law was designed to return human remains and cultural objects which had long been unlawfully obtained or taken from them . In this case , the archaeologists who studied the bones , James Chatters and Douglas Owsley , the latter with the Smithsonian Institution , both asserted that the bones were only distantly related to today 's Native Americans . They also said the remains had features that more closely resembled Polynesian or Southeast Asian peoples , a finding that would exempt the bones from NAGPRA . Kennewick Man became the subject of a controversial nine-year court case between the United States Army Corps of Engineers ( USACE ) , scientists , and Native American tribes who claimed ownership of the remains . Under NAGPRA , the tribes had the right to rebury the remains of Kennewick Man and to refuse scientific study of the man they referred to as the Ancient One .

The term is often abbreviated as WHG . During the Mesolithic , the WHGs inhabited an area stretching from the British Isles in the west to the Carpathians in the east . Along with Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers ( SHG ) and Eastern Hunter-Gatherers ( EHG ) , the WHGs constituted one of the three main genetic groups in the postglacial period of early Holocene Europe . The border between WHGs and EHGs ran roughly from the lower Danube , northward along the western forests of the Dnieper towards the western Baltic Sea . Genetic studies indicate that the WHGs were a mix of Upper Paleolithic people ( Cro-Magnon ) of the Grotte du Bichon and EHGs , who carried 75% Ancient North Eurasian ( ANE ) ancestry . [ citation needed ] SHGs were in turn an equal mix of WHGs and EHGs . Once widely dispersed throughout Europe , the WHGs were largely displaced by successive expansions of Early European Farmers ( EEFs ) during the early Neolithic , but experience a male-driven resurgence during the Middle Neolithic . During the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age , Western Steppe Herders ( WSHs ) from the Pontic-Caspian steppe embarked on a massive expansion , which further displaced the WHGs .

  "/wiki/Minnesota_Woman": "Minnesota Woman , also known as Pelican Rapids-Minnesota Woman , is the skeletal remains of a woman thought to be 8,000 years old . The bones were found near Pelican Rapids , Minnesota on June 16 , 1931 , during construction on U.S. Route 59 . The bones were brought to Dr. Albert Jenks at the University of Minnesota , who identified them as the bones of a woman who was 15 or 16 years old , but who had never borne children . The woman had two artifacts - a dagger made from an elk 's horn and a conch shell pendant . The conch shell came from a snail species known as Busycon perversa , which had previously only been known to exist in Florida . The road crew dug up the site without an investigation by archaeologists , so some of the exact details of the woman 's death were hard to determine . The site indicated that the woman had not been ritually buried , and there was a thin layer of broken clam or mussel shells over the body . This led to the hypothesis that the woman had drowned , either by breaking through the ice or by falling off a boat , and that her body had been covered in mud at the bottom of a glacial lake . Before 1926 , most scientists theorized that human beings had only appeared in America within the last couple of thousand years . The discovery of Minnesota Woman provided evidence that humans had been in America for many thousand years before that . Scientists now recognize the girl as someone whose ancestors were Paleo-Indian .

The Neolithic overlaps the Mesolithic and Bronze Age periods in Europe as cultural changes moved from the southeast to northwest at about 1 km/year - this is called the Neolithic Expansion . The duration of the Neolithic varies from place to place , its end marked by the introduction of bronze implements : in southeast Europe it is approximately 4,000 years ( i.e . 7000 BCE-3000 BCE ) while in parts of Northwest Europe it is just under 3,000 years ( c. 4500 BCE-1700 BCE ) . The spread of the Neolithic from the Near East Neolithic to Europe was first studied quantitatively in the 1970s , when a sufficient number of 14C age determinations for early Neolithic sites had become available . Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza discovered a linear relationship between the age of an Early Neolithic site and its distance from the conventional source in the Near East ( Jericho ) , thus demonstrating that , on average , the Neolithic spread at a constant speed of about 1 km/yr .
