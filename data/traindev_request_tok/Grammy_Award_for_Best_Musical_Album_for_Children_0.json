The primary ceremonies were televised in the US on CBS ; however , as has become the custom , most of the awards were handed out during a pre-telecast portion of the show held at the Los Angeles Convention Center and broadcast on XM Satellite Radio . Two nights prior to the show Aretha Franklin was honored as the MusiCares Person of the Year . The year 's big winner was Amy Winehouse : the 24-year-old singer had recently entered a drug rehabilitation program and did not come to Los Angeles . American officials initially refused her a work visa ; they reversed the decision , but by then it was too late for her to make the trip from the UK . She became the fifth female solo artist to get five awards in one night , alongside Lauryn Hill , Norah Jones , Alicia Keys and Beyonc\u00e9 . The golden anniversary of the Grammys and NARAS was noted in references and performances throughout this year 's ceremony . Alicia Keys was the evening 's opening musician , singing and playing piano alongside archived video and audio of Frank Sinatra . Other collaborative performances linking contemporary and past musicians included Beyonc\u00e9 with Tina Turner , Rihanna with The Time , classical pianist Lang Lang with jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and inaugural Grammy winner Keely Smith with Kid Rock . Special recognition of the musical contributions of The Beatles also featured . The Foo Fighters won Best Rock Album , and performed their nominated song The Pretender in a highly collaborative performance that involved a social media selection of classical musicians ( the My Grammy Moment YouTube contest was won by violinist Ann Marie Calhoun ) .",

The Muppets originated in the short-form television series Sam and Friends , which aired from 1955 to 1961 . Following appearances on late night talk shows and in advertising during the 1960s , the Muppets began appearing on Sesame Street in 1969 , and attained celebrity status and international recognition through The Muppet Show ( 1976-1981 ) , which received four Primetime Emmy Award wins and twenty-one nominations during its five-year run . During the 1970s and 1980s , the Muppets diversified into theatrical films , including The Muppet Movie ( 1979 ) ; The Great Muppet Caper ( 1981 ) ; and The Muppets Take Manhattan ( 1984 ) .

Disney acquired the Muppets in February 2004 , allowing the characters to gain broader public exposure than in previous years . Under Disney , subsequent projects included two films : The Muppets ( 2011 ) and Muppets Most Wanted ( 2014 ) ; a short-lived primetime series on ABC ; and a reboot of the Muppet Babies animated series . In their six-decade career , the Muppets have been regarded as a staple of the entertainment industry and popular culture in the United States and English-speaking area generally , being recognized by various cultural institutions and organizations , including the American Film Institute , Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , Library of Congress , and the Hollywood Walk of Fame .",
