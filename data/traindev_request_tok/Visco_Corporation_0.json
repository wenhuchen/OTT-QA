  "/wiki/Andro_Dunos": "Andro Dunos [ a ] is a scrolling shooter arcade video game developed by Visco Corporation and originally published by SNK on June 15 , 1992 . It is the first title to be created by Visco for both the Neo Geo MVS ( arcade ) and Neo Geo AES ( home ) platforms , as well as their only officially licensed release for the AES during its commercial life span . Taking place on a futuristic sci-fi setting where an unknown alien race from outer space has steadily increased their invasion activities , players assume control of the Yellow Cherry and Red Fox space fighter crafts in a last-ditch effort for mankind to overthrow the alien forces . Though it was initially launched for the Neo Geo MVS , Andro Dunos was later released for the Neo Geo AES on July 17 of the same year . Andro Dunos was met with mixed reception from both critics and reviewers alike since its initial release on the MVS and later on the AES , who commended various aspects of the title such as the colorful and detailed graphics , sound design , simplistic controls and the ability to choose between multiple weapons , but the gameplay was criticized for being unremarkable and not original .",
  "/wiki/Neo_Geo_(system)": "The Neo Geo ( Japanese : \u30cd\u30aa\u30b8\u30aa , Hepburn : Neojio ) , stylised as NEO\u30fbGEO , also written as NEOGEO , is a cartridge-based arcade system board and fourth-generation home video game console released on April 26 , 1990 , by Japanese game company SNK Corporation . It was the first system in SNK 's Neo Geo family . The Neo Geo was marketed as 24-bit ; its CPU is technically a 16/32-bit 68000-based system with an 8/16-bit Z80 coprocessor , while its GPU chipset has a 24-bit graphics data bus . The Neo Geo originally launched as the MVS ( Multi Video System ) coin-operated arcade machine . The MVS offers owners the ability to put up to six different cartridges into a single cabinet , a unique feature that was also a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace , as well as saving money long-term . With its games stored on self-contained cartridges , a game cabinet can be exchanged for a different game title by swapping the game 's ROM cartridge and cabinet artwork . A home console version was also made , called AES ( Advanced Entertainment System ) . It was originally launched as a rental console for video game stores in Japan ( called Neo Geo Rental System ) , with its high price causing SNK not to release it for home use - this was later reversed due to high demand and it came into the market as a luxury console . The AES had the same raw specs as the MVS and had full compatibility , thus managed to bring a true arcade experience to home users . The Neo Geo was revived along with the brand overall in December 2012 through the introduction of the Neo Geo X handheld and home system . The Neo Geo was a very powerful system when released , more powerful than any video game console at the time , and many arcade systems such as rival Capcom 's CPS , which did not surpass it until the CP System II in 1993 . The Neo Geo MVS was a success during the 1990s due to the cabinet 's low cost , six ROM slots , and compact size .",

  "/wiki/Arcade_game": "An arcade game or coin-op game is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants , bars and amusement arcades . Most arcade games are video games , pinball machines , electro-mechanical games , redemption games or merchandisers . While exact dates are debated , the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s . Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s , the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost . The Eastern Hemisphere retains a strong arcade industry .",

  "/wiki/Dreamcast": "The Dreamcast [ a ] is a home video game console released by Sega on November 27 , 1998 in Japan , September 9 , 1999 in North America , and October 14 , 1999 in Europe . It was the first in the sixth generation of video game consoles , preceding Sony 's PlayStation 2 , Nintendo 's GameCube and Microsoft 's Xbox . The Dreamcast was Sega 's final home console , marking the end of the company 's 18 years in the console market . In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Sega Saturn , the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with off-the-shelf components , including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU . Released in Japan to a subdued reception , the Dreamcast enjoyed a successful U.S. launch backed by a large marketing campaign , but interest in the system steadily declined as Sony built hype for the upcoming PlayStation 2 . Sales did not meet Sega 's expectations despite several price cuts , and the company continued to incur significant financial losses . After a change in leadership , Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31 , 2001 , withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself as a third-party publisher . 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide . Although the Dreamcast had a short lifespan and limited third-party support , reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time . Its library contains many games considered creative and innovative , including Crazy Taxi , Jet Set Radio and Shenmue , as well as high-quality ports from Sega 's NAOMI arcade system board .
