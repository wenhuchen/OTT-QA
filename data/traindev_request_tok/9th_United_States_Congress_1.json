The district borders were shifted south in the 2012 redistricting . It lost its share of the North Carolina border , and now takes in part of the area near the South Carolina-Georgia border . The district 's current configuration dates from a deal struck in the early 1990s between state Republicans and Democrats in the South Carolina General Assembly to create a majority-black district . The rural counties of the historical black belt in South Carolina make up much of the district , but it sweeps south to include most of the majority-black precincts in and around Charleston , and sweeps west to include most of the majority-black precincts in and around Columbia . In all of its configurations , its politics have been dominated by black voters in the Columbia and Charleston areas . Following the Reconstruction era , the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed Jim Crow laws , as well as a new constitution in 1895 that effectively disfranchised blacks , crippling the Republican Party in the state . For most of the next 60 years , South Carolina was essentially a one-party state dominated by the Democrats , and blacks were nearly excluded from the political system . Demographic and political changes have included the Great Migration of blacks out of the state during the Jim Crow era in the first half of the 20th century . At the same time , many white Democrats felt chagrin at the national party 's greater support of civil rights for blacks from the 1940s onward , and began splitting their tickets in federal elections . After successes of the Civil Rights Movement in gaining passage of federal legislation in the mid-1960s to enforce their constitutional rights and ability to vote , blacks in South Carolina supported national Democratic candidates .",
