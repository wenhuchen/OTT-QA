It is the first epoch of the Paleogene Period in the modern Cenozoic Era . The name is a combination of the Ancient Greek pal\u00e6o- meaning old and the Eocene Epoch ( which succeeds the Paleocene ) , translating to the old part of the Eocene . The epoch is bracketed by two major events in Earth 's history . The K-Pg extinction event , brought on by an asteroid impact and possibly volcanism , marked the beginning of the Paleocene and killed off 75% of living species , most famously the non-avian dinosaurs . The end of the epoch was marked by the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum ( PETM ) , which was a major climatic event wherein about 2,500-4,500 gigatons of carbon were released into the atmosphere and ocean systems , causing a spike in global temperatures and ocean acidification . In the Paleocene , the continents of the Northern Hemisphere were still connected via some land bridges ; and South America , Antarctica , and Australia had not completely separated yet . The Rocky Mountains were being uplifted , the Americas had not yet joined , the Indian Plate had begun its collision with Asia , and the North Atlantic Igneous Province was forming in the third-largest magmatic event of the last 150 million years . In the oceans , the thermohaline circulation probably was much different than it is today , with downwellings occurring in the North Pacific rather than the North Atlantic , and water density mainly being controlled by salinity rather than temperature . The K-Pg extinction event caused a floral and faunal turnover of species , with previously abundant species being replaced by previously uncommon ones . In the Paleocene , with a global average temperature of about 24-25 \u00b0C ( 75-77 \u00b0F ) , compared to 14 \u00b0C ( 57 \u00b0F ) in more recent times , the Earth had a greenhouse climate without permanent ice sheets at the poles , like the preceding Mesozoic . As such , there were forests worldwide - including at the poles - but they had low species richness in regards to plant life , populated by mainly small creatures that were rapidly evolving to take advantage of the recently emptied Earth .",

Colombia is bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea , the northwest by Panama , the south by both Ecuador and Peru , the east by Venezuela , the southeast by Brazil , and the west by the Pacific . It comprises thirty-two departments , with the capital in Bogot\u00e1 . Colombia is ethnically and linguistically diverse , with its rich cultural heritage reflecting influences by various Amerindian civilizations , European settlement , forced African labor , and immigration from Europe and the greater Middle East . Urban centres are concentrated in the Andean highlands and the Caribbean coast . Colombia has been inhabited by various American Indian peoples since at least 12,000 BCE , including the Muisca , Quimbaya , and the Tairona . Spaniards arrived in 1499 and by the mid-16th century annexed part of the region , establishing the New Kingdom of Granada , with Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 as its capital . Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819 , but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved , with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada . The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 . Panama seceded in 1903 , leading to Colombia 's present borders . Beginning in the 1960s , the country suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence , both of which escalated in the 1990s . Since 2005 , there has been significant improvement in security , stability , and rule of law .",

Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 788 AD , the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties , reaching its zenith under Almoravid and Almohad rule , when it spanned parts of Iberia and northwestern Africa . The Marinid and Saadi dynasties resisted foreign domination into the 17th century , allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid Ottoman occupation . The Alaouite dynasty , which rules to this day , seized power in 1631 . The country 's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean attracted the interest of Europe , and in 1912 , Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates , with an international zone in Tangier .

Angola has an exclave province , the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda . The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era , hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups , tribes and kingdoms . The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato , the Kwanyama and the Mbunda . After a protracted anti-colonial struggle , independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist-Leninist People 's Republic of Angola , a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba . The civil war between the ruling People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa , lasted until 2002 . The sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary , presidential constitutional republic . Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves , and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war ; however , the standard of living remains low for most of the population , and life expectancy in Angola is among the lowest in the world , while infant mortality is among the highest .",

With 206 million inhabitants , Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world . Nigeria has the third-largest youth population in the world , after India and China , with more than 90 million of its population under the age of eighteen . Nigeria is the world 's 20th largest economy as of 2015 [ update ] , worth more than $ 500 billion and $ 1 trillion in terms of nominal GDP and purchasing power parity , respectively .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Phosphatosaurus": "Phosphatosaurus is an extinct genus of dyrosaurid crocodylomorph . It existed during the early Eocene , with fossils having been found from North Africa in Tunisia and Mali . Named in 1955 , Phosphatosaurus is a monotypic genus ; the type species is P. gavialoides . A specimen has been discovered from Niger , but it can not be classified at the species level . Phosphatosaurus is closely related to the Cretaceous genus Sokotosuchus , which is known from Niger and Mali . Because Phosphatosaurus is only known from Paleogene localities , the close relationship with Sokotosuchus implies that there is a long ghost lineage extending back into the Maastrichtian that is not known in the fossil record .",
  "/wiki/Rhabdognathus": "Rhabdognathus is an extinct genus of dyrosaurid crocodylomorph . It is known from rocks dating to the Paleocene epoch from western Africa , and specimens dating back to the Maastrichtian era were identified in 2008 . It was named by Swinton in 1930 for a lower jaw fragment from Nigeria . The type species is Rhabdognathus rarus . St\u00e9phane Jouve subsequently assessed R. rarus as indeterminate at the species level , but not at the genus level , and thus dubious . Two skulls which were assigned to the genus Rhabdognathus but which could not be shown to be identical to R. rarus were given new species : R. aslerensis and R. keiniensis , both from Mali . The genus formerly contained the species Rhabdognathus compressus , which was reassigned to Congosaurus compressus after analysis of the lower jaw of a specimen found that it was more similar to that of the species Congosaurus bequaerti . Rhabdognathus is believed to be the closest relative to the extinct Atlantosuchus .",
  "/wiki/Paleogene": "The Paleogene ( /\u02c8p\u00e6l.i.\u0259\u02ccd\u0292i\u02d0n , -i.o\u028a- , \u02c8pe\u026a.li- , -li.o\u028a-/ PAL-ee-\u0259-jeen , -\u2060ee-oh- , PAY-lee- , -\u2060lee-oh- ; also spelled Palaeogene or Pal\u00e6ogene ; informally Lower Tertiary or Early Tertiary ) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period 66 million years ago ( Mya ) to the beginning of the Neogene Period 23.03 Mya . It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon . The earlier term Tertiary Period was used to define the span of time now covered by the Paleogene and subsequent Neogene periods ; despite no longer being recognised as a formal stratigraphic term , 'Tertiary ' is still widely found in earth science literature and remains in informal use . The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small , simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period . The United States Geological Survey uses the abbreviation PE for the Paleogene , but the more commonly used abbreviation is PG with the PE being used for Paleocene . This period consists of the Paleocene , Eocene , and Oligocene epochs . The end of the Paleocene ( 55.5/54.8 Mya ) was marked by the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum , one of the most significant periods of global change during the Cenozoic , which upset oceanic and atmospheric circulation and led to the extinction of numerous deep-sea benthic foraminifera and on land , a major turnover in mammals . The term 'Paleogene System ' is applied to the rocks deposited during the 'Paleogene Period ' .",

Mexican United States ) , is a country in the southern portion of North America . It is bordered to the north by the United States ; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean ; to the southeast by Guatemala , Belize , and the Caribbean Sea ; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico . Covering almost 2,000,000 square kilometers ( 770,000 sq mi ) , the nation is the fifth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent state in the world . With an estimated population of over 129 million people , Mexico is the tenth most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world , while being the second most populous nation in Latin America after Brazil . Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states plus Mexico City ( CDMX ) , which is the capital city and its most populous city . Other metropolises in the country include Guadalajara , Monterrey , Puebla , Toluca , Tijuana , and Le\u00f3n . Pre-Columbian Mexico dates to about 8000 BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization and was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec , Toltec , Teotihuacan , Zapotec , Maya , and Aztec before first contact with Europeans . In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence . The post-independence period was tumultuous , characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes .",

  "/wiki/Sokotosaurus": "Hyposaurus is a genus of extinct marine dyrosaurid crocodyliform . Fossils have been found in Paleocene aged rocks of the Maria Farinha Formation in Pernambuco , Brazil , Iullemmeden Basin in West Africa , ? Campanian-Maastrichtian ( Late Cretaceous ) Shendi Formation of Sudan and Maastrichtian ( Late Cretaceous ) through Danian ( Early Paleocene ) strata in New Jersey , Alabama and South Carolina . Isolated teeth comparable to Hyposaurus have also been found in Thanetian ( Late Paleocene ) strata of Virginia . It was related to Dyrosaurus , and is the only dyrosaurid known from the western hemisphere . The priority of the species H. rogersii has been debated , however there is no sound basis for the recognition of more than one species from North America . The other North American species ( i.e . H. fraterculus , H. ferox and H. natator ) are therefore considered nomina vanum ( i.e . empty names ) .",
  "/wiki/Junior_synonym": "In scientific nomenclature , a synonym is a scientific name that applies to a taxon that ( now ) goes by a different scientific name , although the term is used somewhat differently in the zoological code of nomenclature . For example , Linnaeus was the first to give a scientific name ( under the currently used system of scientific nomenclature ) to the Norway spruce , which he called Pinus abies . This name is no longer in use : it is now a synonym of the current scientific name , Picea abies . Unlike synonyms in other contexts , in taxonomy a synonym is not interchangeable with the name of which it is a synonym . In taxonomy , synonyms are not equals , but have a different status . For any taxon with a particular circumscription , position , and rank , only one scientific name is considered to be the correct one at any given time ( this correct name is to be determined by applying the relevant code of nomenclature ) . A synonym can not exist in isolation : it is always an alternative to a different scientific name . Given that the correct name of a taxon depends on the taxonomic viewpoint used ( resulting in a particular circumscription , position and rank ) a name that is one taxonomist 's synonym may be another taxonomist 's correct name ( and vice versa ) . Synonyms may arise whenever the same taxon is described and named more than once , independently . They may also arise when existing taxa are changed , as when two taxa are joined to become one , a species is moved to a different genus , a variety is moved to a different species , etc . Synonyms also come about when the codes of nomenclature change , so that older names are no longer acceptable ; for example , Erica herbacea L. has been rejected in favour of Erica carnea L. and is thus its synonym .",
