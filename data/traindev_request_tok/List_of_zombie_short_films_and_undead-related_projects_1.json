  "/wiki/Serial_(radio_and_television)": "In television and radio programming , a serial has a continuing plot that unfolds in a sequential episode-by-episode fashion . Serials typically follow main story arcs that span entire television seasons or even the full run of the series , which distinguishes them from traditional episodic television that relies on more stand-alone episodes . Worldwide , the soap opera is the most prominent form of serial dramatic programming . Serials rely on keeping the full nature of the story hidden and revealing elements episode by episode to keep viewers tuning in to learn more . Often these shows employ recapping segments at the beginning and cliffhangers at the end of each episode . Such shows also place a demand on viewers to tune into every episode to follow the plot . The invention of recording devices such as VCRs and DVRs has made following these type of shows easier , which has resulted in increased success and popularity . Prior to the advent of DVRs , television networks shunned serials in prime time as they made broadcast programming reruns more difficult and television producers shunned them because they were tougher to go into broadcast syndication years down the road . Serials contrast with episodic television , with plots relying on a more independent stand-alone format . Procedural drama television programs are commonly episodic . Shorter serial programs known as telenovelas ( and earlier , radionovelas ) , originating and often produced in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking Latin America , have become popular worldwide .",

  "/wiki/Flash_animation": "Adobe Flash animation or Adobe Flash cartoon is an animated film that is created with the Adobe Animate ( formerly Flash Professional ) platform or similar animation software and often distributed in the SWF file format . The term Adobe Flash animation refers to both the file format and the medium in which the animation is produced . Adobe Flash animation has enjoyed mainstream popularity since the mid-2000s , with many Adobe Flash-animated television series , television commercials , and award-winning online shorts being produced since then . In the late 1990s , when bandwidth was still at 56 kbit/s for most Internet users , many Adobe Flash animation artists employed limited animation or cutout animation when creating projects intended for web distribution . This allowed artists to release shorts and interactive experiences well under 1 MB , which could stream both audio and high-end animation . Adobe Flash is able to integrate bitmaps and other raster-based art , as well as video , though most Adobe Flash films are created using only vector-based drawings , which often result in a somewhat clean graphic appearance . Some hallmarks of poorly produced Adobe Flash animation are jerky natural movements ( seen in walk-cycles and gestures ) , auto-tweened character movements , lip-sync without interpolation , and abrupt changes from front to profile view . Adobe Flash animations are typically distributed by way of the World Wide Web , in which case they are often referred to as Internet cartoons , online cartoons , or web cartoons . Web Adobe Flash animations may be interactive and are often created in a series . An Adobe Flash animation is distinguished from a Webcomic , which is a comic strip distributed via the Web , rather than an animated cartoon .",

  "/wiki/Zombie_Hunters:_City_of_the_Dead": "Zombie Hunters : City of the Dead is an independent television series produced in New York City , notable as being the first broadcast zombie-based television series . It details the lives of a group of friends banding together to survive the epidemic resurrection of dead humans . These re-animated corpses are driven by a need to feed , and only attack living humans . Conceived in 2005 by series creator Patrick Devaney , the show is n't so much about the zombies themselves and the fight against them ; it 's really about how the decisions characters make to survive to change them in profound ways . The main character of Billy Cassidy ( portrayed by Devaney ) is an Irish Catholic whose violent actions are in direct conflict with his faith , often resulting in an inner conflict that quickly manifests itself in external ways . Paul Michael Bates and John Salazar ( played by Christopher J. Murphy and Rick Martinez , respectively ) are Cassidy 's main partners , and they are later joined by Dr Rebecca Kaufman ( Linnet Brooks ) and Carrie Walker , RN ( Teri Hansen ) . This constitutes the first main group of hunters in the first season . Though their personalities are vastly different from each other , their situation forces them all to find some common ground in order to make it through the ongoing crisis . There is also an underlying Judeo-Christian religious theme running through the series , which becomes more apparent in later episodes . In addition to this is everything Zombiephiles have come to expect from the genre : lots of firearms being used to shoot Zombies in the head , and graphic depictions of people being eaten alive ( through practical effects created by SFX artist Michael A. Scardillo ) , as well as all the emotional turmoil and psychological suspense that comes along with surviving a zombie apocalypse . Later television series of a similar nature appeared and showcased far too familiar storylines , resulting in conflict and controversy . To date , the show has aired on over 80 public access and public television stations across the US ."
