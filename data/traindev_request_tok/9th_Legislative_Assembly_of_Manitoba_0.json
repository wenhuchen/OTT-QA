  "/wiki/Patrons_of_Industry_in_Manitoba": "The Patrons of Industry in Manitoba was an extension of a farmers ' organization operating in Ontario ( see Patrons of Industry ) and the United States in the 1880s and 1890s . The Patrons lobbied extensively and became politically active , running provincial and federal candidates . The Manitoba Patrons , as a fraternal organization , was initially focused on coordinating an agrarian cooperative movement on the Prairies . Its first lodges in Manitoba and the North-West Territories began in 1890 , with a grand lodge ( central body ) established in 1891 . At first the group was known as the Patrons of Manitoba and the North-West - its conventions included delegates from Manitoba and the territorial districts of Assiniboia , Saskatchewan and Alberta . The organization 's leader was Charles Braithwaite , who was chosen at a convention held in November 1891 . Through direct bulk buying in competition with established stores , the movement brought down the price of farm supplies ( binder twine ) and other farmers ' needs , and through strong lobbying it helped achieve a cut in tariffs on imported goods important to farmers . The Manitoba group turned to direct political action in 1894 . Following a tour of Manitoba by Braithwaite ( who was a spellbinding orator ) , the Patrons nominated candidates in all but two of the province 's constituencies , in anticipation of the next provincial election . The Patrons were the first third party to emerge in Manitoba after partisan government was formally introduced to the province in 1888 . They opposed both Conservatives and Liberals and were for a time affiliated with Dalton McCarthy , a dissident federal Conservative . On August 23 , 1894 , the Patrons proved they were a significant force in Manitoba politics when their candidate John Forsyth defeated Conservative leader John Andrew Davidson in a two-sided Beautiful Plains by-election ( there was no Liberal candidate in the race ) .",
