  "/wiki/1966_NBA_Finals": "The 1966 NBA World Championship Series was the championship round of the 1966 NBA Playoffs , which concluded the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) 's 1965-66 season . The Eastern Division champion Boston Celtics faced the Western Division champion Los Angeles Lakers in a best-of-seven series that the Celtics won 4 games to 3 . For the Celtics this was their tenth straight finals appearance , which tied a North American professional sports record set by the National Hockey League 's Montreal Canadiens from 1951 to 1960 . Thus Boston won its 8th consecutive league title , which no other team has achieved in North American professional sports competition . Before Game 2 , after the Los Angeles Lakers ' comeback overtime win in Game 1 , Red Auerbach , who had challenged the entire league to topple the Celtics from their reign by announcing he would retire after 1965-1966 before the season had started ( thus giving his detractors one last shot at him ) , announced Bill Russell as the Celtics coach for 1966-1967 and beyond . He would be the first African-American to coach in the NBA . Laker coach Fred Schaus privately fumed that Red 's hiring had taken away all of the accolades his Lakers should have received following their tremendous Game 1 win . The Celtics won the next three games and looked ready to close out L.A. in Game 5 . However , the Lakers won the next two games , setting the stage for another classic Game 7 in the Boston Garden . The Celtics raced out to a huge lead , and held off a late Los Angeles rally to capture the NBA title and send Red Auerbach out a champion . This was the last NBA championship series until 2016 in which a team trailing 3 games to 1 rallied to force a Game 7 ."
