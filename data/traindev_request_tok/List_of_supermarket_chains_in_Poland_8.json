  "/wiki/Pharmacy": "Pharmacy is the science and technique of preparing , dispensing , and reviewing drugs and providing additional clinical services . It is a health profession that links health sciences with pharmaceutical sciences and aims to ensure the safe , effective , and affordable use of drugs . The professional practice is becoming more clinically oriented as most of the drugs are now manufactured by pharmaceutical industries . Based on the setting , the pharmacy is classified as a community or institutional pharmacy . Providing direct patient care in the community of institutional pharmacies are considered clinical pharmacy . The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications , and it also includes more modern services related to health care , including clinical services , reviewing medications for safety and efficacy , and providing drug information . Pharmacists , therefore , are the experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients . An establishment in which pharmacy ( in the first sense ) is practiced is called a pharmacy ( this term is more common in the United States ) or a chemist 's ( which is more common in Great Britain ) . In the United States and Canada , drugstores commonly sell medicines , as well as miscellaneous items such as confectionery , cosmetics , office supplies , toys , hair care products and magazines and occasionally refreshments and groceries . In its investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients , the work of the pharma may be regarded as a precursor of the modern sciences of chemistry and pharmacology , prior to the formulation of the scientific method .",

The Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel around 720 BCE . Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian , Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces . The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom by 110 BCE , which in 63 BCE however became a client state of the Roman Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE , and in 6 CE created the Roman province of Judea . Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , the expulsion of the Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries . In the 7th century CE , the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099 , followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187 ."
