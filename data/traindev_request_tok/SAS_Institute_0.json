  "/wiki/Software_appliance": "A software appliance is a software application combined with just enough operating system ( JeOS ) to run optimally on industry-standard hardware ( typically a server ) or in a virtual machine . It is a software distribution or firmware that implements a computer appliance . Virtual appliances are a subset of software appliances . The main distinction is the packaging format and the specificity of the target platform . A virtual appliance is a virtual machine image designed to run on a specific virtualization platform , while a software appliance is often packaged in more generally applicable image format ( e.g. , Live CD ) that supports installations to physical machines and multiple types of virtual machines . Installing a software appliance to a virtual machine and packaging that into an image , creates a virtual appliance .",

Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",

  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",

  "/wiki/Lattice_C": "The Lattice C Compiler was released in June 1982 by Lifeboat Associates and was the first C compiler for the IBM Personal Computer . The compiler sold for $ 500 and would run on PC DOS or MS-DOS ( which at the time were the same product with different brandings ) . The hardware requirements were 96KB of RAM and two floppy drives . It was ported to many other platforms , such as mainframes ( MVS ) , minicomputers ( VMS ) , workstations ( UNIX ) , OS/2 , the Commodore Amiga , Atari ST and the Sinclair QL . The compiler was subsequently repackaged by Microsoft under a distribution agreement as Microsoft C version 2.0 . Microsoft developed their own C compiler that was released in April 1985 as Microsoft C Compiler 3.0 . Lattice was purchased by SAS Institute in 1987 and rebranded as SAS/C . After this , support for other platforms dwindled until compiler development ceased for all platforms except IBM mainframes . The product is still available in versions that run on other platforms , but these are cross compilers that only produce mainframe code . Some of the early 1982 commercial software for the IBM PC was ported from CP/M ( where it was written for the BDS C subset of the C language ) to MS-DOS using Lattice C including Perfect Writer , PerfectCalc , PerfectSpeller and PerfectFiler . This suite was bundled with the Seequa Chameleon and Columbia Data Products .",
  "/wiki/C_(programming_language)": "C ( /si\u02d0/ , as in the letter c ) is a general-purpose , procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming , lexical variable scope , and recursion , while a static type system prevents unintended operations . By design , C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language . Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers , from supercomputers to embedded systems . C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix . Later , it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system . During the 1980s , C gradually gained popularity . It has become one of the most widely used programming languages , with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems . C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 ( see ANSI C ) and by the International Organization for Standardization . C is an imperative procedural language . It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions , all with minimal runtime support . Despite its low-level capabilities , the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming . A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code .",
  "/wiki/Database_Management": "A database is an organized collection of data , generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system . Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques . The database management system ( DBMS ) is the software that interacts with end users , applications , and the database itself to capture and analyze the data . The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database . The sum total of the database , the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system . Often the term database is also used to loosely refer to any of the DBMS , the database system or an application associated with the database . Computer scientists may classify database-management systems according to the database models that they support . Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s . These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables , and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data . In the 2000s , non-relational databases became popular , referred to as NoSQL because they use different query languages ."
