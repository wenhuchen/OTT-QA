  "/wiki/Lake": "A lake is an area filled with water , localized in a basin , surrounded by land , apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake . Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean , and therefore are distinct from lagoons , and are also larger and deeper than ponds , though there are no official or scientific definitions . Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams , which are usually flowing . Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams . Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas , rift zones , and areas with ongoing glaciation . Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers . In some parts of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age . All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales , as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them . Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use , for hydro-electric power generation or domestic water supply , or for aesthetic , recreational purposes , or other activities .",
  "/wiki/Topographic_elevation": "The elevation of a geographic location is its height above or below a fixed reference point , most commonly a reference geoid , a mathematical model of the Earth 's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface ( see Geodetic datum \u00a7 Vertical datum ) . The term elevation is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth 's surface , while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface , such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit , and depth is used for points below the surface . Elevation is not to be confused with the distance from the center of the Earth . Due to the equatorial bulge , the summits of Mount Everest and Chimborazo have , respectively , the largest elevation and the largest geocentric distance .",
  "/wiki/Length": "Length is a measure for distance . In the International System of Quantities , length is a quantity with dimension distance . In most systems of measurement , the unit of length is a base unit , from which other units are derived . Length is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of an object . Types of length include height , which is vertical length or vertical extent , and width or breadth , which are the side-to-side length , measuring across the object at right angles to the height . Length is the measure of one spatial dimension , whereas area is a measure of two dimensions ( length squared ) and volume is a measure of three dimensions ( length cubed ) .",

  "/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system": "A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers , letters or symbols . [ note 1 ] The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position and two or three of the numbers represent a horizontal position ; alternatively , a geographic position may be expressed in a combined three-dimensional Cartesian vector . A common choice of coordinates is latitude , longitude and elevation . To specify a location on a plane requires a map projection .",
  "/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)": "In hydrology , discharge is the volumetric flow rate of water that is transported through a given cross-sectional area . It includes any suspended solids ( e.g . sediment ) , dissolved chemicals ( e.g . CaCO3 ( aq ) ) , or biologic material ( e.g . diatoms ) in addition to the water itself . Synonyms vary by discipline . For example , a fluvial hydrologist studying natural river systems may define discharge as streamflow , whereas an engineer operating a reservoir system might define discharge as outflow , which is contrasted with inflow .",
  "/wiki/Boardman_Lake_(Idaho)": "Boardman Lake is an alpine lake in Camas County , Idaho , United States , located in the Soldier Mountains in the Sawtooth National Forest . While no trails lead to the lake , it can be most easily accessed from trail 091 . The lake is north of Boardman Peak .",
  "/wiki/Boardman_Creek": "Boardman Creek is a stream in the Sawtooth National Forest in Camas County , Idaho in the United States . It is a tributary of the South Fork Boise River , which in turn is tributary to the Snake River and Columbia River . Boardman Creek originates in the Soldier Mountains , then flows north to the South Fork of the Boise River . At Boardman Creek 's mouth a foot bridge crosses the South Fork of the Boise River from Sawtooth National Forest road 227 . Trail 091 follows the creek for much of its length while other trails and forest road 010 are found in the upper portions of the creek 's watershed . Boardman Lake is a small alpine lake found in the uppermost reaches of the Boardman Creek watershed . Boardman Creek drains the northern slopes of Smoky Dome , the highest peak in the Soldier Mountains , as well as Boardman Peak and the four Smoky Dome Lakes , Lower , Upper 1 , Upper 2 , and West Smoky Dome Lakes .",
