At the Prussian court , her previously limited education was widened , and she adopted the liberal outlook possessed by Sophia Charlotte , who became her good friend and whose views influenced Caroline all her life . As a young woman , Caroline was much sought-after as a bride . After rejecting the suit of the nominal King of Spain , Archduke Charles of Austria , she married George Augustus , the third-in-line to the British throne and heir apparent to the Electorate of Hanover . They had eight children , seven of whom grew to adulthood . Caroline moved permanently to Britain in 1714 when her husband became Prince of Wales .

He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries , especially France , for which he was popularly called Peacemaker , but his relationship with his nephew , the German Emperor Wilhelm II , was poor .
