The type species is Asilisaurus kongwe . Asilisaurus fossils were uncovered in Tanzania and date back to the Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic ( ~245 million years ago ) , making it one of the oldest known members of the Avemetatarsalia ( animals on the dinosaur/pterosaur side of the archosaurian family tree ) . It was the first non-dinosaurian dinosauriform recovered from Africa.The discovery of Asilisaurus has provided evidence for a rapid diversification of avemetatarsalians during the Middle Triassic , with the diversification of archosaurs during this time previously only documented in pseudosuchians ( crocodylian-line archosaurs ) . Asilisaurus is known from a relatively large amount of fossils compared to most non-dinosaur dinosauromorphs . This has allowed it to provide important information for the evolution of other silesaurids and the origin of dinosaurs . It had several unique features compared to its close relatives , such as a lack of teeth at the front of the premaxilla and a lower jaw which was not only toothless at the tip , but also downturned . These indicate that it probably had a small beak on the tip of the snout . It was fairly basal among silesaurids , and retained some dinosaur-like features absent in advanced silesaurids , such as a supratemporal fossa and a quadrate which overlaps the squamosal . On the other hand , it also retains primitive features contrasting with dinosaurs , including two hip vertebrae , a closed hip socket , a crurotarsal ankle , and a non-vestigial fifth toe of the foot .",

  "/wiki/Hypselorhachis_mirabilis": "Hypselorhachis is a genus of extinct reptile , possibly a ctenosauriscid archosaur related to Ctenosauriscus . It lived during the Triassic Period . It is currently known only from a single vertebra found from the Middle Triassic Manda Beds in Tanzania . The vertebra is preserved in reasonably good condition , as although the tall neural spine is chipped in several places it is not broken despite being quite slender , only around 20 mm thick transversely . The type species is H. mirabilis , mentioned but never fully described by English paleontologist Alan J. Charig . Hypselorhachis was assigned to the Ctenosauriscidae , a group of sail-backed archosaurs , in 1988 . It was formally described by Richard J. Butler and co-workers in 2009 . The name means 'wonderful high spine ' , from the Latin 'mirabilis ' 'wonderful ' and the Greek '\u1f51\u03c0\u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ' , 'high ' and '\u1fe5\u03b1\u03c7\u03b9\u03c2 ' 'spine ' or 'backbone ' . Hypselorhachis was probably at least 3 metres long , maybe up to 4 or 5 metres , as the vertebra is certainly from quite a large animal . Hypselorhachis is known from a single anterior dorsal vertebra found from the Lifua Member of the Manda Beds , which is thought to have been deposited during the Anisian stage . The only characteristic that diagnoses the genus is a feature seen in the prezygapophysis - a small part of the bone projects dorsally . Because of the lack of any other material , comparisons between it and other early archosaurs can only be based on features seen in the vertebra , making any current phylogenetic classification tentative .",

  "/wiki/Mandible": "The mandible , lower jaw or jawbone is the largest , strongest and lowest bone in the human face . It forms the lower jaw and holds the lower teeth in place . The mandible sits beneath the maxilla . It is the only movable bone of the skull ( discounting the ossicles of the middle ear ) . The bone is formed in the fetus from a fusion of the left and right mandibular prominences , and the point where these sides join , the mandibular symphysis , is still visible as a faint ridge in the midline . Like other symphyses in the body , this is a midline articulation where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage , but this articulation fuses together in early childhood .

Paracrocodylomorpha was named by paleontologist J. Michael Parrish in 1993 , although the group is now considered to encompass more reptiles than his original definition intended . The most recent definition of Paracrocodylomorpha , as defined by Sterling Nesbitt in 2011 , is the least inclusive clade containing Poposaurus and Crocodylus niloticus ( the Nile crocodile ) .

  "/wiki/Nundasuchus_songeaensis": "Nundasuchus is an extinct genus of crurotarsan , possibly a suchian archosaur related to Paracrocodylomorpha . Remains of this genus are known from the Middle Triassic Manda beds of southwestern Tanzania . It contains a single species , Nundasuchus songeaensis , known from a single partially complete skeleton , including vertebrae , limb elements , osteoderms , and skull fragments . Nundasuchus lived in what is now Tanzania , Africa around 240 million years ago . Members of this genus were likely carnivores , around 2.7 to 3 meters ( 9 feet ) long , with ziphodont ( steak knife-like ) teeth and rows of bony plates ( osteoderms ) along their back . Phylogenetic analyses consistently place this genus within the group Crurotarsi based on features of the ankle . Most studies also consider it a pseudosuchian , meaning that it was more closely related to modern crocodilians than it was to dinosaurs . However , Nundasuchus had an upright stance , with legs situated directly underneath the body , as with various other early pseudosuchians ( such as rauisuchians and aetosaurs ) but unlike modern crocodilians . The classification of Nundasuchus relative to other pseudosuchians is somewhat controversial . Some phylogenetic analyses place it near or at the base of the group , sometimes along with phytosaurs , based on certain plesiomorphic ( primitive ) features such as teeth on the palate , a short pubis , and characteristics of the calcaneum ( heel bone ) . Another hypothesis , supported by its original 2014 description , considers it to be somewhat more advanced than those groups , instead being closer to Ticinosuchus and paracrocodylomorphs ( the group containing rauisuchians and the ancestors of modern crocodilians ) . This classification scheme is justified by the presence of staggered osteoderms , heart-shaped spine tables , and a groove on the femoral head .",
  "/wiki/Suchia": "Suchia is a clade of archosaurs containing the majority of pseudosuchians ( crocodilians and their extinct relatives ) . It was defined as the least inclusive clade containing Aetosaurus ferratus , Rauisuchus tiradentes , Prestosuchus chiniquensis , and Crocodylus niloticus ( the living Nile crocodile ) by Nesbitt ( 2011 ) . Generally the only pseudosuchian group which is omitted from Suchia is the family Ornithosuchidae , although at least one analysis classifies ornithosuchids as close relatives of erpetosuchids ( which are usually considered suchians ) and aetosaurs ( which are suchians by definition of the group ) . Phytosaurs are also excluded from Suchia , although it is unclear whether they qualify as pseudosuchians in the first place . There is some controversy over which traits , if any , can be used to distinguish suchians from non-suchian archosaurs . Anatomical features which evolve at the base of a group , and can thus be used to characterize the group , are known as synapomorphies . The two most comprehensive recent studies on archosaur relationships , Nesbitt ( 2011 ) and Ezcurra ( 2016 ) , each came to different conclusions on what synapomorphies characterize Suchia . Nevertheless , they did agree on one trait that likely qualified as a synapomorphy of Suchia : a calcaneal tuber which was significantly wider than it was tall .",

Previously , the oldest record of dinosaurs was from Argentina and dated back to the late Carnian stage , about 231.4 million years ago .

The name Ornithischia , or bird-hipped , reflects this similarity and is derived from the Greek stem ornith- ( \u1f40\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8- ) , meaning of a bird , and ischion ( \u1f34\u03c3\u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ) , plural ischia , meaning hip joint .

Ornithischians with well known anatomical adaptations include the ceratopsians or horn-faced dinosaurs ( e.g . Triceratops ) , armored dinosaurs ( Thyreophora ) such as stegosaurs and ankylosaurs , pachycephalosaurids and the ornithopods . There is strong evidence that certain groups of ornithischians lived in herds , often segregated by age group , with juveniles forming their own flocks separate from adults . Some were at least partially covered in filamentous ( hair- or feather- like ) pelts , and there is much debate over whether these filaments found in specimens of Tianyulong , Psittacosaurus , and Kulindadromeus may have been primitive feathers .",
  "/wiki/Dinosaur": "Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles [ note 1 ] of the clade Dinosauria . They first appeared during the Triassic period , between 243 and 233.23 million years ago , although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research . They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event 201.3 million years ago ; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods . The fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs , having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch . As such , birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago . Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs , or birds ; and non-avian dinosaurs , which are all dinosaurs other than birds . Dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from taxonomic , morphological and ecological standpoints . Birds , at over 10,000 living species , are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish . Using fossil evidence , paleontologists have identified over 500 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs . Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species ( birds ) and fossil remains . Through the first half of the 20th century , before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs , most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded . Most research conducted since the 1970s , however , has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction .",

Osteoderms are uncommon in mammals , but have occurred in many xenarthrans ( armadillos and the extinct glyptodonts and ground sloths ) . The heavy , bony osteoderms have evolved independently in many different lineages . These varied structures should be thought of as anatomical analogues , not homologues , and do not necessarily indicate monophyly . The structures are however derived from scutes , common to all classes of amniotes and are an example of what has been termed deep homology . In many cases , osteoderms may function as defensive armor . Osteoderms are composed of bone tissue , and are derived from a scleroblast neural crest cell population during embryonic development of the organism . The scleroblastic neural crest cell population shares some homologous characteristics associated with the dermis . The osteoderms of modern crocodilians are heavily vascularized , and can function as both armor and as heat-exchangers , allowing these large reptiles to rapidly raise or lower their temperature . Another function is to neutralize acidosis , caused by being submerged under water for longer periods of time and leading to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood . The calcium and magnesium in the dermal bone will release alkaline ions into the bloodstream , acting as a buffer against acidification of the body fluids .",

  "/wiki/Senior_synonym": "In scientific nomenclature , a synonym is a scientific name that applies to a taxon that ( now ) goes by a different scientific name , although the term is used somewhat differently in the zoological code of nomenclature .

This name is no longer in use : it is now a synonym of the current scientific name , Picea abies . Unlike synonyms in other contexts , in taxonomy a synonym is not interchangeable with the name of which it is a synonym . In taxonomy , synonyms are not equals , but have a different status . For any taxon with a particular circumscription , position , and rank , only one scientific name is considered to be the correct one at any given time ( this correct name is to be determined by applying the relevant code of nomenclature ) . A synonym can not exist in isolation : it is always an alternative to a different scientific name . Given that the correct name of a taxon depends on the taxonomic viewpoint used ( resulting in a particular circumscription , position and rank ) a name that is one taxonomist 's synonym may be another taxonomist 's correct name ( and vice versa ) . Synonyms may arise whenever the same taxon is described and named more than once , independently . They may also arise when existing taxa are changed , as when two taxa are joined to become one , a species is moved to a different genus , a variety is moved to a different species , etc . Synonyms also come about when the codes of nomenclature change , so that older names are no longer acceptable ; for example , Erica herbacea L. has been rejected in favour of Erica carnea L. and is thus its synonym .",
  "/wiki/Teleocrater_rhadinus": "Teleocrater ( meaning completed basin , in reference to its closed acetabulum ) is a genus of avemetatarsalian archosaur from the Middle Triassic Manda Formation of Tanzania . The name was coined by English paleontologist Alan Charig in his 1956 doctoral dissertation , but was only formally published in 2017 by Sterling Nesbitt and colleagues . The genus contains the type and only species T. rhadinus . Uncertainty over the affinities of Teleocrater have persisted since Charig 's initial publication ; they were not resolved until Nesbitt et al . performed a phylogenetic analysis . They found that Teleocrater is most closely related to the similarly enigmatic Yarasuchus , Dongusuchus , and Spondylosoma in a group that was named the Aphanosauria . Aphanosauria was found to be the sister group of the Ornithodira , the group containing dinosaurs and pterosaurs . A carnivorous quadruped measuring 7-10 feet ( 2.1-3.0 m ) long , Teleocrater is notable for its unusually long neck vertebrae . The neural canals in its neck vertebrae gradually become taller towards the back of the neck , which may be a distinguishing trait . Unlike the Lagerpetidae or Ornithodira , the hindlimbs of Teleocrater are not adapted for running ; the metatarsal bones are not particularly elongated . Also unlike lagerpetids and ornithodirans , Teleocrater inherited the more flexible ankle configuration present ancestrally among archosaurs , suggesting that the same configuration was also ancestral to Avemetatarsalia but was lost independently by several lineages .

Since their armoured plates are often preserved and are abundant in certain localities , aetosaurs serve as important Late Triassic tetrapod index fossils . Many aetosaurs had wide geographic ranges , but their stratigraphic ranges were relatively short . Therefore , the presence of particular aetosaurs can accurately date a site that they are found in . Aetosaur remains have been found since the early 19th century , although the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales . Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives , with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers . They are now considered to have been entirely terrestrial animals ."
