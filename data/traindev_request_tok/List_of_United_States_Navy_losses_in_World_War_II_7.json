During the war , she was credited with sinking 13 Japanese ships ( including two destroyers , a light cruiser , and the aircraft carrier Taih\u014d ) and damaging another five ; not all of these credits were confirmed by postwar JANAC accounting . She also holds the distinction of sinking the highest warship tonnage of any U.S. submarine . She was lost in 1944 , probably sunk by a mine off northern Hokkaid\u014d on 7 November . Albacore was the second vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the albacore . Her keel was laid on 21 April 1941 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton , Connecticut .

  "/wiki/Torpedo_boat": "A torpedo boat is a relatively small and fast naval ship designed to carry torpedoes into battle . The first designs rammed enemy ships with explosive spar torpedoes , and later designs launched self-propelled Whitehead torpedoes . They were created to counter battleships and other slow and heavily armed ships by using speed , agility , and the power of their torpedo weapons . A number of inexpensive torpedo boats attacking en masse could overwhelm a larger ship 's ability to fight them off using its large but cumbersome guns . An inexpensive fleet of torpedo boats could pose a threat to much larger and more expensive fleets of capital ships , albeit only in the coastal areas to which their small size and limited fuel load restricted them . The introduction of fast torpedo boats in the late 19th century was a serious concern to the era 's naval strategists . In response , navies operating large ships introduced smaller ships to counter torpedo boats , mounting light quick-firing guns . These ships , which came to be called torpedo boat destroyers and later simply destroyers , became larger and took on more roles , making torpedo attacks as well as defending against them , and eventually defending against submarines and aircraft . The destroyer eventually became the predominant type of surface warship in the guided missile age . In the modern era , the old concept of a very small , fast , and cheap surface combatant with powerful offensive weapons is taken up by the fast attack craft .",

The Japanese archipelago separates the sea from the Pacific Ocean . It is bordered by Japan , Korea ( North and South ) and Russia .

This isolation also reflects in the fauna species and in the water salinity , which is lower than in the ocean . The sea has no large islands , bays or capes . Its water balance is mostly determined by the inflow and outflow through the straits connecting it to the neighboring seas and Pacific Ocean . Few rivers discharge into the sea and their total contribution to the water exchange is within 1% . The seawater has an elevated concentration of dissolved oxygen that results in high biological productivity . Therefore , fishing is the dominant economic activity in the region .
