The Juris Doctor is earned by completing law school in Australia , Canada , the United States , and some other common law countries . It has the academic standing of a professional doctorate ( in contrast to a research doctorate ) in the United States , a master 's degree in Australia , and a second-entry baccalaureate degree in Canada ( in all three jurisdictions the same as other professional degrees such as M.D . or D.D.S./D.M.D. , the degrees required to be a practicing physician or dentist , respectively ) . The degree was first awarded in the United States in the early 20th century and was created as a modern version of the old European doctor of law degree ( such as the Dottore in Giurisprudenza in Italy and the Juris Utriusque Doctor in Germany and central Europe ) . Originating from the 19th-century Harvard movement for the scientific study of law and first denominated LL.B. , it is a degree that in most common law jurisdictions is the primary professional preparation for lawyers . It traditionally involves a three-year program , although some U.S. law schools offer a two-year accelerated program in which students complete courses over two additional summer semesters . The LL.B . was largely replaced by the J.D . in the US in the later 20th century .",
