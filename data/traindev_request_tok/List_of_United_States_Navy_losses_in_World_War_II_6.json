  "/wiki/Utah_Beach": "Utah , commonly known as Utah Beach , was the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on June 6 , 1944 ( D-Day ) , during World War II . The westernmost of the five code-named landing beaches in Normandy , Utah is on the Cotentin Peninsula , west of the mouths of the Douve and Vire rivers . Amphibious landings at Utah were undertaken by United States Army troops , with sea transport , mine sweeping , and a naval bombardment force provided by the United States Navy and Coast Guard as well as elements from the British , Dutch and other Allied navies . The objective at Utah was to secure a beachhead on the Cotentin Peninsula , the location of important port facilities at Cherbourg . The amphibious assault , primarily by the US 4th Infantry Division and 70th Tank Battalion , was supported by airborne landings of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Division . The intention was to rapidly seal off the Cotentin Peninsula , prevent the Germans from reinforcing Cherbourg , and capture the port as quickly as possible . Utah , along with Sword on the eastern flank , was added to the invasion plan in December 1943 . These changes doubled the frontage of the invasion and necessitated a month-long delay so that additional landing craft and personnel could be assembled in England . Allied forces attacking Utah faced two battalions of the 919th Grenadier Regiment , part of the 709th Static Infantry Division . While improvements to fortifications had been undertaken under the leadership of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel beginning in October 1943 , the troops assigned to defend the area were mostly poorly equipped non-German conscripts . D-Day at Utah began at 01:30 , when the first of the airborne units arrived , tasked with securing the key crossroads at Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise and controlling the causeways through the flooded farmland behind Utah so the infantry could advance inland . While some airborne objectives were quickly met , many paratroopers landed far from their drop zones and were unable to fulfill their objectives on the first day .",

  "/wiki/USS_Samuel_B._Roberts_(DE-413)": "USS Samuel B. Roberts ( DE-413 ) was a John C. Butler-class destroyer escort of the United States Navy . Samuel B. Roberts participated in the Battle off Samar , an unlikely victory in which a relatively small force of U.S. warships prevented a vastly superior Japanese force from attacking the amphibious invasion fleet off the large Philippine island of Leyte . This destroyer escort , along with the handful of destroyers , destroyer escorts , and escort carriers of the unit called Taffy 3 , was inadvertently left alone to fend off a fleet of heavily armed Japanese battleships , cruisers , and destroyers in this crucial action off the Island of Samar , during the Battle of Leyte Gulf of October 1944 . Steaming aggressively through a gauntlet of incoming shells , Samuel B. Roberts scored one torpedo hit and numerous gunfire hits as she slugged it out with larger enemy warships before finally being sunk . After the battle , Samuel B. Roberts received the appellation the destroyer escort that fought like a battleship . The ship was named for Coxswain Samuel Booker Roberts , Jr. , a Navy Cross recipient , who had been commended for voluntarily steering a Higgins boat towards enemy forces , in order to divert fire from evacuation efforts being undertaken by other friendly vessels . Samuel B. Roberts was laid down on 6 December 1943 , at the Brown Shipbuilding Company of Houston , Texas . She was launched on 20 January 1944 , sponsored by Mrs. Roberts , and was commissioned on 28 April 1944 , commanded by Lieutenant Commander Robert W. Copeland , USNR .

  "/wiki/Battle_off_Samar": "The Battle off Samar ( Filipino : Labanan sa may Samar ) was the centermost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf , one of the largest naval battles in history , which took place in the Philippine Sea off Samar Island , in the Philippines on October 25 , 1944 . It was the only major action in the larger battle in which the Americans were largely unprepared . The Battle off Samar has been cited by historians as one of the greatest last stands in naval history . Admiral William Halsey , Jr. was lured into taking his powerful 3rd Fleet after a decoy fleet , taking with him every ship in the area that he had the power to command . The only remaining American forces in the area were three escort carrier groups of the 7th Fleet . The escort carriers and destroyer escorts which had been designed to protect slow convoys from submarine attack had been repurposed to attack ground targets and had few torpedoes , as they normally relied on Halsey 's fleet to protect them from armored warships . A Japanese surface force of battleships and cruisers , battered earlier in the larger battle and thought to have been in retreat , instead turned around unobserved and encountered the northernmost of the three groups , Task Unit 77.4.3 ( Taffy 3 ) , commanded by Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague . Taffy 3 's three destroyers and four destroyer escorts possessed neither the firepower nor the armor to effectively oppose the 23 ships of the Japanese force , but nevertheless desperately attacked with 5/38 caliber guns and torpedoes to cover the retreat of their slow jeep carriers . Aircraft from the carriers of Taffy 1 , 2 , and 3 , including FM-2 Wildcats , F6F Hellcats and TBM Avengers , strafed , bombed , torpedoed , rocketed , depth-charged , fired at least one .38 caliber handgun and made numerous dry runs at the Japanese force when they ran out of ammunition . Sprague 's task unit lost two escort carriers , two destroyers , a destroyer escort , and several aircraft . Over a thousand Americans died , comparable to the combined losses of American men and ships at the better-known Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway . But in exchange for the heavy losses for such a small force , they sank three Japanese cruisers , disabled another three , and caused enough confusion to persuade the Japanese commander , Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita , to regroup and ultimately withdraw , rather than advancing to sink troop and supply ships in Leyte Gulf .",
