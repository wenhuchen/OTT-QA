  "/wiki/Point_guard": "The point guard ( PG ) , also called the one or point , is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game . A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position . Point guards are expected to run the team 's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time . Above all , the point guard must understand and accept their coach 's game plan ; in this way , the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football , a catcher in baseball or a playmaker in soccer ( association football ) . They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game . A point guard , like other player positions in basketball , specializes in certain skills . Their primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for their team , or sometimes for themselves . Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor , who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates . This involves setting up plays on the court , getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score , and controlling the tempo of the game . A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets . Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders . A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the shot clock and the game clock , the score , the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams , etc .",

They typically play offensively with their backs towards the basket and position themselves defensively under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in man-to-man defense .

Many power forwards are noted for their mid-range jump-shot , and several players have become very accurate from 12 to 18 feet ( 3.7 to 5.5 m ) . Earlier , these skills were more typically exhibited in the European style of play . Some power forwards , known as stretch fours , have since extended their shooting range to three-point field goals . In the NBA , power forwards usually range from 6\u2032 6\u2033 ( 1.98 m ) to 6\u2032 10\u2033 ( 2.08 m ) without shoes while in the WNBA , power forwards are usually between 6\u2032 0\u2033 ( 1.83 m ) and 6\u2032 3\u2033 ( 1.91 m ) .
