Its 3,748,148 ( 2018 ) inhabitants make it the most populous city proper of the European Union . The city is one of Germany 's 16 federal states . It is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg , and contiguous with Potsdam , Brandenburg 's capital . The two cities are at the center of the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region , which is , with about six million inhabitants and an area of more than 30,000 km\u00b2 , Germany 's third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions . Berlin straddles the banks of the River Spree , which flows into the River Havel ( a tributary of the River Elbe ) in the western borough of Spandau . Among the city 's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree , Havel , and Dahme rivers ( the largest of which is Lake M\u00fcggelsee ) . Due to its location in the European Plain , Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate . About one-third of the city 's area is composed of forests , parks , gardens , rivers , canals and lakes . The city lies in the Central German dialect area , the Berlin dialect being a variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian dialects . First documented in the 13th century and situated at the crossing of two important historic trade routes , Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg ( 1417-1701 ) , the Kingdom of Prussia ( 1701-1918 ) , the German Empire ( 1871-1918 ) , the Weimar Republic ( 1919-1933 ) , and the Third Reich ( 1933-1945 ) . Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world .",
  "/wiki/Teufelsberg": "Teufelsberg is a man-made hill , created in the 20 years following the Second World War by moving approximately 75,000,000 m3 ( 98,000,000 cu yd ) of debris from Berlin . After the Communist putsch in the city parliament of Greater Berlin ( for all four sectors of Berlin ) in September 1948 , separate parliaments and magistrates ( German : Magistrat von Gro\u00df-Berlin ; city government ) were formed for East and West Berlin . This also ended much of the cooperation between West Berlin and the state of Brandenburg , surrounding West Berlin in the North , West and South . While part of the rubble from destroyed quarters in East Berlin was deposited outside the city boundary , all the debris from West Berlin had to be dumped within the western boundary . Due to the shortage of fuel in West Berlin , the rubble transport stopped during the Berlin Blockade . Although there are many similar man-made rubble mounds in Germany ( see Schuttberg ) and other war-torn cities of Europe , Teufelsberg is unique in that the never completed Nazi military-technical college ( Wehrtechnische Fakult\u00e4t ) designed by Albert Speer is buried beneath . The Allies tried using explosives to demolish the school , but it was so sturdy that covering it with debris turned out to be easier . In June 1950 the West Berlin Magistrate decided to open a new rubble disposal on that site . The disposal was planned for 12,000,000 m3 ( 16,000,000 cu yd ) . With the end of material shortages after the blockade , an average of 600 trucks deposited 6,800 m3 ( 8,900 cu yd ) of material daily . On 14 November 1957 , the ten millionth cubic metre arrived . The site was closed to dumping in 1972 , leaving approximately 26,000,000 m3 ( 34,000,000 cu yd ) of debris , and to a lesser extent construction waste .",
