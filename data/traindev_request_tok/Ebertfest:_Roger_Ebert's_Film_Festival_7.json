  "/wiki/You,_the_Living": "You , the Living ( Swedish : Du levande ) is a 2007 Swedish black comedy-drama film written and directed by Roy Andersson . The film is an exploration of the grandeur of existence , centered on the lives of a group of individuals , such as an overweight woman , a disgruntled psychiatrist , a heartbroken groupie , a carpenter , a business consultant , and a school teacher with emotional problems and her rug-selling husband . The basis for the film is an Old Norse proverb , Man is man 's delight , taken from the Poetic Edda poem H\u00e1vam\u00e1l . The title comes from a stanza in Goethe 's Roman Elegies , which also appears as a title card in the beginning of the film : Therefore rejoice , you , the living , in your lovely warm bed , until Lethe 's cold wave wets your fleeing foot . The film consists of a fluent succession of fifty short sketches , most with a tragicomic undertone . The cast is mostly non-professional , and alienating techniques are employed such as presenting the characters in grim make-up and having them talk directly to camera . The financing was difficult and the shooting took three years to complete . The film won the Silver Hugo Award for Best Direction at the 2007 Chicago International Film Festival and has received critical acclaim .
