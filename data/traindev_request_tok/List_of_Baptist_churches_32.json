  "/wiki/Free_Will_Baptist_Church_of_Auburn": "The Auburn Free Will Baptist Church is a historic former Baptist church building in Auburn Township , Geauga County , Ohio , United States . Constructed in the second quarter of the nineteenth century , it is no longer home to the congregation that built it , but it remains a significant component of the area 's built environment , and it has been named a historic site . The Auburn Free Will Baptist Church was formed in 1839 or 1840 , led by an Elder Miller as the first pastor . The congregation was able to build a church building by the end of 1840 , but forty years later the congregation remained weak enough that they were forced to share their pastor with another church . :218 Before the building was finished , the church often worshipped in a schoolhouse or in a barn belonging to farmer Richard Slitor . :463 After its construction , it was used both by Baptists and by the Methodists for most of the rest of the century , and the Baptists continued worshipping in it until the era of the Second World War . Built with clapboarded walls on a foundation of sandstone , the church is most distinctive for its roofline and the roof 's structural support . From the outside , the roof resembles an ordinary gable roof , but an unusual system of trusses and diagonal bracing supports the underside of the roof . Local historians have deemed this construction style particularly rare in the Connecticut Western Reserve . With this exception , it is typical of the region 's vernacular Greek Revival churches ; three windows appear on the sides and on the second story of the front , while the main entrance is centered between a window on each side of the front 's first floor . A tower once sat atop the front of the building . In May 1976 , the church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places , qualifying both because of its historically distinctive architecture and because of its place in local history .",
