  "/wiki/Baker_Site": "The Baker Site is an archaeological site in Muhlenberg County , Kentucky , located north of Andrew 's Run and 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) northwest of Rochester . The site is a shell midden site dating from the Middle Archaic period . In addition to middens , the site also includes four human graves and three dog graves . A number of artifacts , including projectile points and scrapers , have been obtained from the site . The first surveys of the site took place in 1938 , when pits were dug at the site to obtain material for chicken feed . The site was named for Harry Baker , who owned the neighboring piece of land . In 1979 , a state survey observed that the center of the site had been destroyed , leaving only the periphery - about 25% of the total site - comparatively undisturbed . Nevertheless , the site remains valuable , and its edges are believed to retain substantial amounts of information . Such an assessment depended partly on the surface collection performed by the 1979 survey , which recovered 55 stone tools and 44 artifacts derived from animals . The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 1 , 1986 . It is part of the Green River Shell Middens Archeological District , a National Historic Landmark .",
