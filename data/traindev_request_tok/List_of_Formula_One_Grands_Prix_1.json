Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

  "/wiki/German_Grand_Prix": "The German Grand Prix ( German : Gro\u00dfer Preis von Deutschland ) was a motor race that was held most years since 1926 , with 75 races having been held . The race has been held at only three venues throughout its history ; the N\u00fcrburgring in Rhineland-Palatinate , Hockenheimring in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and occasionally AVUS in Berlin . The race continued to be known as the German Grand Prix , even through the era when the race was held in West Germany . Because West Germany was prevented from taking part in international events in the immediate post-war period , the German Grand Prix only became part of the Formula One World Championship in 1951 . It was designated the European Grand Prix four times between 1954 and 1974 , when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe . It has been organised by the Automobilclub von Deutschland ( AvD ) since 1926 . The German Grand Prix was held at Hockenheimring every year between 1977 and 2006 ( except 1985 ) . During this time , a separate F1 race was held in Germany at the N\u00fcrburgring most years from 1995 until 2007 under the title of the European Grand Prix . Originally intended to begin in 2007 , Hockenheimring and the N\u00fcrburgring alternated hosting the German Grand Prix between 2008 and 2014 , at which point N\u00fcrburgring pulled out of hosting the event in 2015 , leaving Hockenheim the sole host of the race but only in alternating years until 2018 . A further one-year deal placed the German Grand Prix on the 2019 calendar . As of 2020 [ update ] , the German Grand Prix has not been run again .",
  "/wiki/Luxembourg_Grand_Prix": "The Luxembourg Grand Prix ( German : Gro\u00dfer Preis von Luxemburg ) was the name given to two races of the FIA Formula One World Championship , held in 1997 and 1998 . The FIA rulings for Formula One stipulate that no country be allowed more than one race . However , the FIA has got around this ruling in the past by running Grands Prix under another name ; although the Imola circuit is not in San Marino , races held there have been run under the title of the San Marino Grand Prix as the circuit is nearby . In 1997 , there were two Grands Prix in Spain and two in Germany . Barcelona hosted the Spanish Grand Prix whilst Jerez hosted the European Grand Prix ; in Germany , Hockenheim hosted the German Grand Prix and a second race was planned for the N\u00fcrburgring . The FIA decided to name the race the Luxembourg Grand Prix as the circuit was located some 80 kilometres ( 50 miles ) from the Germany-Luxembourg border , thereby circumventing the ban on two races having the same name . The 1998 race was also known as the Luxembourg Grand Prix despite no European Grand Prix taking place : the rights to the European Grand Prix had been revoked from the organisers of the Jerez race after an incident on the podium in 1997 , and they refused to allow the N\u00fcrburgring to use the title in 1998 . From 1999 to 2007 , the N\u00fcrburgring hosted its race under the title of the European Grand Prix . And then , since in 2008-2012 the European Grand Prix race was held at the Valencia Street Circuit , the race at the N\u00fcrburgring returned to its main title of the German Grand Prix for the races held there in 2009 , 2011 , and 2013 .",

Hungary 's capital and largest city is Budapest ; other major urban areas include Debrecen , Szeged , Miskolc , P\u00e9cs and Gy\u0151r . The territory of modern Hungary was for centuries inhabited by a succession of peoples , including Celts , Romans , Germanic tribes , Huns , West Slavs and the Avars . The foundations of the Hungarian state were established in the late ninth century CE by the Hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d following the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . His great-grandson Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000 , converting his realm to a Christian kingdom . By the 12th century , Hungary became a regional power , reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) . It came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , and later joined Austria to form the Austro-Hungarian Empire , a major European power .

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin .

With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed .

Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas .

Periods of influence from other regions , primarily China , followed by periods of isolation , particularly from Western Europe , have characterized the history of Japan . While archaeological evidence indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period , the first written mention of the archipelago appears in Chinese texts from the first century AD .
