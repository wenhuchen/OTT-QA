  "/wiki/Disco": "Disco is a genre of dance music and a subculture that emerged in the 1970s from the United States ' urban nightlife scene . The disco sound is typified by four-on-the-floor beats , syncopated basslines , and string sections , horns , electric piano , synthesizers , and electric rhythm guitars . Lead guitar features less frequently in disco than in rock . Well-known disco artists include Donna Summer , Gloria Gaynor , the Bee Gees , Chic , KC and the Sunshine Band , Thelma Houston , Sister Sledge , the Trammps , Village People and Michael Jackson . While performers and singers garnered public attention , record producers working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the genre . Films such as Saturday Night Fever ( 1977 ) and Thank God It 's Friday ( 1978 ) contributed to disco 's mainstream popularity . Disco started as a mixture of music from venues popular with African Americans and also Hispanic and Latino Americans , and LGBT peoplein Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s . Disco can be seen as a reaction by the counterculture during this period to both the dominance of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music at the time . Several dance styles were developed during the period of disco 's popularity in the United States , including the Bump and the Hustle . By the late 70s , most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes , and DJs would mix dance records at clubs such as Studio 54 in New York City , a venue popular among celebrities . Discoth\u00e8que-goers often wore expensive , extravagant and sexy fashions . There was also a thriving drug subculture in the disco scene , particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights , such as cocaine and Quaaludes , the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed disco biscuits .",

  "/wiki/Salsa_(dance)": "Salsa is a Latin dance associated with the music genre of the same name which originated in the 1960s in New York City . Salsa is an amalgamation of Cuban dances that were popular in the ballrooms and nightclubs of Havana by the end of the 1950s ( e.g . casino , mambo and pachanga ) , as well as American jazz dances . It was primarily developed by Puerto Ricans living in New York ( Nuyoricans ) in the late 1960s and early 1970s . Different regions of Latin America and the United States have distinct salsa styles of their own , such as Cuban , Puerto Rican , Cali Colombia , L.A. and New York styles . Salsa dance socials are commonly held in nightclubs , bars , ballrooms , restaurants , and outside , especially when part of an outdoor festival . In many styles of salsa dancing , as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping , the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes . Weight shifts cause the hips to move . Arm and shoulder movements are also incorporated . Salsa generally uses music ranging from about 150 bpm ( beats per minute ) to around 250 bpm , although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160-220 bpm . The basic Salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music . The odd number of steps creates the syncopation inherent to Salsa dancing and ensures that it takes 8 beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps .",

In classical music , tempo is typically indicated with an instruction at the start of a piece ( often using conventional Italian terms ) and is usually measured in beats per minute ( or bpm ) . In modern classical compositions , a metronome mark in beats per minute may supplement or replace the normal tempo marking , while in modern genres like electronic dance music , tempo will typically simply be stated in bpm . Tempo may be separated from articulation and meter , or these aspects may be indicated along with tempo , all contributing to the overall texture . While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a vital skill for a musical performer , tempo is changeable . Depending on the genre of a piece of music and the performers ' interpretation , a piece may be played with slight tempo rubato or drastic accelerando . In ensembles , the tempo is often indicated by a conductor or by one of the instrumentalists , for instance the drummer .",

It includes a wide range of styles primarily breaking which was created in the 1970s and made popular by dance crews in the United States . The television show Soul Train and the 1980s films Breakin ' , Beat Street , and Wild Style showcased these crews and dance styles in their early stages ; therefore , giving hip-hop mainstream exposure . The dance industry responded with a commercial , studio-based version of hip-hop - sometimes called new style - and a hip-hop influenced style of jazz dance called jazz-funk . Classically trained dancers developed these studio styles in order to create choreography from the hip-hop dances that were performed on the street . Because of this development , hip-hop dance is practiced in both dance studios and outdoor spaces . The commercialization of hip-hop dance continued into the 1990s and 2000s with the production of several television shows and movies such as The Grind , Planet B-Boy , Rize , StreetDance 3D , America 's Best Dance Crew , Saigon Electric , the Step Up film series , and The LXD , a web series . Though the dance is established in entertainment , including mild representation in theater , it maintains a strong presence in urban neighborhoods which has led to the creation of street dance derivatives Memphis jookin , turfing , jerkin ' , and krump . 1980s films , television shows , and the Internet have contributed to introducing hip-hop dance outside the United States .

  "/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)": "The Cha Cha Cha ( sometimes called cha-cha ) , is a dance of Cuban origin . It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s . This rhythm was developed from the danz\u00f3n-mambo . The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers ' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps ( correctly , on the fourth count of each measure ) that characterize the dance . In the early 1950s , Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta Am\u00e9rica . The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danz\u00f3n , danzonete , and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds . Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo . To make his music more appealing to dancers , Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less syncopated . When Orquesta Am\u00e9rica performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana , it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a triple step in their footwork producing the sound cha-cha-cha . Thus , the new style came to be known as cha-cha-ch\u00e1 and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step . The basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 ( one , two , three , cha-cha ) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the Santer\u00eda religion . For example , one of the steps used in the dance for the orisha Ogun uses an identical footwork pattern .",

In the 1970s , cuarteto became one of the cornerstones of C\u00f3rdoba 's cultural identity - together with Hortensia magazine . Both reflected a local brand of popular culture overlooked by the establishment , and proposed an alternative to the Buenos Aires-centered culture that television was spreading to the rest of the country .

There are also cases where songs are used in tie-in marketing campaigns that allow them to become more than just a song . Tie-ins and merchandising can be used for toys or for food or other products . Although the origins of the music video date back to musical short films that first appeared in the 1920s , they again came into prominence in the 1980s when the channel MTV ( originally Music Television ) based its format around the medium . Prior to the 1980s , these kinds of videos were described by various terms including illustrated song , filmed insert , promotional ( promo ) film , promotional clip , promotional video , song video , song clip or film clip . Music videos use a wide range of styles and contemporary video-making techniques , including animation , live action , documentary , and non-narrative approaches such as abstract film . Some music videos combine different styles with the music , such as animation and live action . Combining these styles and techniques has become more popular because of the variety for the audience .

Other music videos may not have any concept , being merely a filmed version of the song 's live concert performance .",
  "/wiki/Telenovelas": "A telenovela [ a ] is a type of a limited-run television serial drama or soap opera produced primarily in Latin America . The word combines tele ( for television ) [ b ] and novela ( meaning novel ) . [ c ] Similar genres around the world include teleserye ( Philippines ) , dorama ( Japan ) , t\u00e9l\u00e9roman ( Canada , specifically Quebec ) , or simply dramas ( Asia and the rest of the Arab World ) . Commonly described using the American colloquialism Spanish soap opera , many telenovelas share some stylistic and thematic similarities to the soap opera familiar to the English-speaking world . The significant difference is their series run length ; telenovelas tell one self-contained story , typically within the span of a year or less whereas soap operas tend to have intertwined storylines told during indefinite , continuing runs . This makes them shorter than most other television series , but still much longer than a miniseries . This planned run results in a faster-paced , more concise style of melodrama compared to a typical soap opera . Episodes of telenovelas usually last between 30 and 45 minutes , and rarely more than an hour , except for final episodes . The telenovela combines drama with the 19th-century feuilleton , and naturally evolved from the Latin American radionovela , according to Blanca de Lizaur . The medium has been used frequently by authorities in various countries to transmit sociocultural messages by incorporating them into storylines . By the 1970s and 1980s , Mexico became a world pioneer in using telenovelas to shape behavior , particularly successful in introducing the idea of family planning . Mexico and Brazil later , in the 1990s , played a key role in the international export of telenovelas , thus the so-called 'Telenovela Craze ' that spread in many regions in the world until today .",

  "/wiki/Striptease": "A striptease is an erotic or exotic dance in which the performer gradually undresses , either partly or completely , in a seductive and sexually suggestive manner . The person who performs a striptease is commonly known as a stripper or exotic dancer . In Western countries , the venues where stripteases are performed on a regular basis are now usually called strip clubs , though they may be performed in venues such as pubs ( especially in the UK ) , theaters and music halls . At times , a stripper may be hired to perform at a bachelor or bachelorette party . In addition to providing adult entertainment , stripping can be a form of sexual play between partners . This can be done as an impromptu event or - perhaps for a special occasion - with elaborate planning involving fantasy wear , music , special lighting , practiced dance moves , or unrehearsed dance moves . Striptease involves a slow , sensuous undressing . The stripper may prolong the undressing with delaying tactics such as the wearing of additional clothes or putting clothes or hands in front of just undressed body parts such as the breasts or genitalia . The emphasis is on the act of undressing along with sexually suggestive movement , rather than the state of being undressed . In the past , the performance often finished as soon as the undressing was finished , though today 's strippers usually continue dancing in the nude . The costume the stripper wears before disrobing can form part of the act . In some cases , audience interaction can form part of the act , with the audience urging the stripper to remove more clothing , or the stripper approaching the audience to interact with them .",
