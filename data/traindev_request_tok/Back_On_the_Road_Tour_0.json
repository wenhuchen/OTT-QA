  "/wiki/Train_Kept_A-Rollin'": "Train Kept A-Rollin ' ( or The Train Kept A-Rollin ' ) is a song first recorded by American jazz and rhythm and blues musician Tiny Bradshaw in 1951 . Originally performed in the style of a jump blues , Bradshaw borrowed lyrics from an earlier song and set them to an upbeat shuffle arrangement that inspired other musicians to perform and record it . Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio made an important contribution in 1956 - they reworked it as a guitar riff-driven song , which features an early use of intentionally distorted guitar in rock music . In 1965 , the Yardbirds popularized the song as an early psychedelic blues rock song , due largely to Jeff Beck 's fuzz-toned guitar work . Theirs soon became the most copied arrangement with recordings by a variety of musicians . After guitarist Jimmy Page joined the group , the Yardbirds recorded an updated version with new lyrics as Stroll On for the film Blowup in 1966 . With a highly charged rhythm section and a dual lead guitar attack by Beck and Page , it is seen as a forerunner to heavy metal music . When the Yardbirds broke up in 1968 , Train Kept A-Rollin ' was adopted as a concert opener by Page 's new band , Led Zeppelin , during its early ( and again later ) touring years . The song also became an important part of Aerosmith 's early live repertoire and in 1974 , they recorded it for their second album . Their version is actually a two-part song - the first has a slower , groove-oriented arrangement , while the second uses that of the Yardbirds . Aerosmith turned it into a hard rock standard and a staple of classic rock radio ; it remains one of their most popular tunes . Train Kept A-Rollin ' has been performed and recorded by numerous other artists .",
