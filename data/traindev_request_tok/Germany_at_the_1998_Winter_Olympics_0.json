  "/wiki/Georg_Hackl": "Georg Hackl ( born 9 September 1966 ) is a German former luger who was three time Olympic and World Champion . He is known affectionately as Hackl-Schorsch or as the Speeding Wei\u00dfwurst a reference to what he looks like in his white bodysuit coming down the luge at fast speeds . Hackl was born in Berchtesgaden , Bavaria . He took up luge as part of his physical education lessons whilst at school , learning to slide at the K\u00f6nigssee track . Hackl was known for his rivalry with Markus Prock , with Prock being dominant in World Cup competition whilst Hackl consistently achieved success at the Winter Olympics . Although Hackl was not as natural an athlete as Prock , he was noted as being extremely skilled at setting up his sled to suit particular ice conditions on a given day . In addition his coach and former luger Thomas Schwab highlighted Hackl 's mental strength as being key to his success . He won his first Winter Olympic Games luge medal in 1988 in Calgary , when he finished second in the singles event , while placing fourth in the doubles . Four years later , he improved his performance to win the gold , a feat he repeated in 1994 and 1998 . In 1998 , he won the gold by clocking the fastest time in all four runs , the first in Olympic history in the men 's singles to do so ( Vera Zozula of the Soviet Union did that feat in the women 's singles event at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid , New York ) . That year he was named as German Sportsman of the Year . Hackl won the silver medal again in the 2002 Games , becoming the first Winter Olympian to win a medal in five consecutive Winter Olympics .",
