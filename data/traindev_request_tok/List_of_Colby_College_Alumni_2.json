  "/wiki/Let's_Make_a_Deal": "Let 's Make a Deal ( also known as LMAD ) a television game show that originated in the United States in 1963 and has since been produced in many countries throughout the world . The program was created and produced by Stefan Hatos and Monty Hall , the latter serving as its host for nearly 30 years . The format of Let 's Make a Deal involves selected members of the studio audience , referred to as traders , making deals with the host . In most cases , a trader will be offered something of value and given a choice of whether to keep it or exchange it for a different item . The program 's defining game mechanism is that the other item is hidden from the trader until that choice is made . The trader thus does not know if he or she is getting something of greater value or a prize that is referred to as a zonk , an item purposely chosen to be of little or no value to the trader . Let 's Make a Deal is also known for audience members who dress up in outrageous or crazy costumes in order to increase their chances of being selected as a trader . The most recent edition of Let 's Make a Deal has been airing on CBS since October 5 , 2009 , when it took over the spot on the network 's daytime schedule vacated by the long running soap opera Guiding Light . Wayne Brady is the host of the current series , with Jonathan Mangum as his announcer/assistant . Tiffany Coyne is the current model , joining in 2010 , with musician Cat Gray in 2011 .",
