  "/wiki/Holy_Saviour": "Two names and a variety of titles are used to refer to Jesus in the New Testament . In Christianity , the two names Jesus and Emmanuel that refer to Jesus in the New Testament have salvific attributes . After the crucifixion of Jesus the early Church did not simply repeat his messages , but focused on him , proclaimed him , and tried to understand and explain his message . One element of the process of understanding and proclaiming Jesus was the attribution of titles to him . Some of the titles that were gradually used in the early Church and then appeared in the New Testament were adopted from the Jewish context of the age , while others were selected to refer to , and underscore the message , mission and teachings of Jesus . In time , some of these titles gathered significant Christological significance . Christians have attached theological significance to the Holy Name of Jesus . The use of the name of Jesus in petitions is stressed in John 16:23 when Jesus states : If you ask the Father anything in my name he will give it you . There is widespread belief among Christians that the name Jesus is not merely a sequence of identifying symbols but includes intrinsic divine power .",

During Louis ' childhood , Blanche dealt with the opposition of rebellious vassals and obtained a definitive victory in the Albigensian Crusade which had started 20 years earlier .

Simultaneously , Henry III of England tried to restore his continental possessions , but was utterly defeated at the battle of Taillebourg . His reign saw the annexation of several provinces , notably parts of Aquitaine , Maine and Provence . Louis IX was a reformer and developed French royal justice , in which the king was the supreme judge to whom anyone could appeal to seek the amendment of a judgment . He banned trials by ordeal , tried to prevent the private wars that were plaguing the country , and introduced the presumption of innocence in criminal procedure . To enforce the application of this new legal system , Louis IX created provosts and bailiffs . Following a vow he made after a serious illness and confirmed after a miraculous cure , Louis IX took an active part in the Seventh and Eighth Crusades . He died from dysentery during the latter crusade , and was succeeded by his son Philip III . Louis 's actions were inspired by Christian zeal and Catholic devotion .",

In the churches that observe it , the Assumption is a major feast day , commonly celebrated on 15 August . In many countries , the feast is also marked as a Holy Day of Obligation in the Roman Catholic Church . The Catholic Church teaches as dogma that the Virgin Mary having completed the course of her earthly life , was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory . This doctrine was dogmatically defined by Pope Pius XII on 1 November 1950 , in the apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus by exercising papal infallibility . While the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church believe in the Dormition of the Mother of God ( Dormition of the Theotokos or the Falling Asleep of the Mother of God ) , whether Mary had a physical death has not been dogmatically defined . In Munificentissimus Deus ( item 39 ) Pope Pius XII pointed to the Book of Genesis ( 3:15 ) as scriptural support for the dogma in terms of Mary 's victory over sin and death through her intimate association with the new Adam ( Christ ) as also reflected in 1 Corinthians 15:54 : then shall come to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory . The New Testament contains no explicit narrative about the death or Dormition , nor of the Assumption of Mary , but several scriptural passages have been theologically interpreted to describe the ultimate fate in this and the afterworld of the Mother of Jesus ( see below ) .

According to Christian tradition , Peter was crucified in Rome under Emperor Nero . He is traditionally counted as the first Bishop of Rome\u200d - \u200cor pope\u200d - \u200cand also by Eastern Christian tradition as the first Patriarch of Antioch . The ancient Christian churches all venerate Peter as a major saint and as the founder of the Church of Antioch and the Roman Church , but differ in their attitudes regarding the authority of his present-day successors ( the primacy of the Bishop of Rome ) . According to Catholic teaching , in Matthew 16:18 Jesus promised Peter a special position in the Church . Two general epistles in the New Testament are ascribed to Peter , but modern scholars generally reject the Petrine authorship of both . The Gospel of Mark was traditionally thought to show the influence of Peter 's preaching and eyewitness memories .

Paul is generally considered one of the most important figures of the Apostolic Age and from the mid-30s to the mid-50s AD he founded several Christian communities in Asia Minor and Europe . He took advantage of his status as both a Jew and a Roman citizen to minister to both Jewish and Roman audiences . According to the New Testament book Acts of the Apostles ( often simply called Acts ) , Paul persecuted some of the early disciples of Jesus , possibly Hellenised diaspora Jews converted to Christianity , in the area of Jerusalem prior to his conversion . [ note 1 ] In the narrative of Acts , Paul was traveling on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus on a mission to arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem when the resurrected Jesus appeared to him in a great light . He was struck blind , but after three days his sight was restored by Ananias of Damascus and Paul began to preach that Jesus of Nazareth is the Jewish Messiah and the Son of God . [ Acts 9:20-9:21 ] Approximately half of the book of Acts deals with Paul 's life and works . Thirteen of the twenty-seven books in the New Testament have traditionally been attributed to Paul . Seven of the Pauline epistles are undisputed by scholars as being authentic , with varying degrees of argument about the remainder . Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews is not asserted in the Epistle itself and was already doubted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries . [ note 2 ] It was almost unquestioningly accepted from the 5th to the 16th centuries that Paul was the author of Hebrews , but that view is now almost universally rejected by scholars . The other six are believed by some scholars to have come from followers writing in his name , using material from Paul 's surviving letters and letters written by him that no longer survive .",

  "/wiki/Denis": "Denis was a 3rd-century Christian martyr and saint . According to his hagiographies , he was bishop of Paris in the third century and , together with his companions Rusticus and Eleutherius , was martyred for his faith by decapitation . Some accounts placed this during Domitian 's persecution and identified St Denis of Paris with the Areopagite who was converted by Paul the Apostle and who served as the first bishop of Athens . Assuming Denis 's historicity , it is now considered more likely that he suffered under the persecution of the emperor Decius shortly after AD 250 . Denis is the most famous cephalophore in Christian legend , with a popular story claiming that the decapitated bishop picked up his head and walked several miles while preaching a sermon on repentance . He is venerated in the Catholic Church as the patron saint of France and Paris and is accounted one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers . A chapel was raised at the site of his burial by a local Christian woman ; it was later expanded into an abbey and basilica , around which grew up the French city of Saint-Denis , now a suburb of Paris .",
