It drains a watershed of nearly 17,000 square miles ( 44,000 km2 ) , 14,751 square miles ( 38,200 km2 ) in Minnesota and about 2,000 sq mi ( 5,200 km2 ) in South Dakota and Iowa . It rises in southwestern Minnesota , in Big Stone Lake on the Minnesota-South Dakota border just south of the Laurentian Divide at the Traverse Gap portage . It flows southeast to Mankato , then turns northeast . It joins the Mississippi south of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul , near the historic Fort Snelling . The valley is one of several distinct regions of Minnesota . The name Minnesota comes from the Dakota language phrase , Mnisota Makoce which is translated to land where the waters reflect the sky , as a reference to the many lakes in Minnesota rather than the cloudiness of the actual river . For over a century prior to the organization of the Minnesota Territory in 1849 , the name St. Pierre ( St. Peter ) had been generally applied to the river by French and English explorers and writers . Minnesota River is shown on the 1757 edition of Mitchell Map as Ouadebameni\u017fsout\u00e9 [ Watp\u00e1 Mn\u00edsota ] or R. St. Peter . On June 19 , 1852 , acting upon a request from the Minnesota territorial legislature , the United States Congress decreed the aboriginal name for the river , Minnesota , to be the rivers official name and ordered all agencies of the federal government to use that name when referencing it . The valley that the Minnesota River flows in is up to five miles ( 8 km ) wide and 250 feet ( 80 m ) deep . It was carved into the landscape by the massive glacial River Warren between 11,700 and 9,400 years ago at the end of the last ice age in North America .",

  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes . Examples of the style can be found in numerous types of National Park structures , including entrance gateways , hotels and lodges , park roads and bridges , visitor centers , trail shelters , informational kiosks , and even mundane maintenance and support facilities . Many of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",

These orders include the Order of Friars Minor , the Order of Saint Clare , and the Third Order of Saint Francis . They adhere to the teachings and spiritual disciplines of the founder and of his main associates and followers , such as Clare of Assisi , Anthony of Padua , and Elizabeth of Hungary , among many others . [ failed verification ] Francis began preaching around 1207 and traveled to Rome to seek approval from Pope Innocent III in 1209 to form a new religious order . The original Rule of Saint Francis approved by the Pope did not allow ownership of property , requiring members of the order to beg for food while preaching . The austerity was meant to emulate the life and ministry of Jesus Christ . Franciscans traveled and preached in the streets , while staying in church properties . Saint Clare , under Francis 's guidance , founded the Poor Clares ( Order of Saint Clare ) in 1212 , which remains a Second Order of the Franciscans . The extreme poverty required of members was relaxed in the final revision of the Rule in 1223 . The degree of observance required of members remained a major source of conflict within the order , resulting in numerous secessions . The Order of Friars Minor , previously known as the Observant branch , is one of the three Franciscan First Orders within the Catholic Church , the others being the Conventuals ( formed 1517 ) and Capuchins ( 1520 ) . The Order of Friars Minor , in its current form , is the result of an amalgamation of several smaller orders completed in 1897 by Pope Leo XIII .",

  "/wiki/Queen_Anne_style_architecture_in_the_United_States": "In the United States , Queen Anne-style architecture was popular from roughly 1880 to 1910 . Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles . The style bears almost no relationship to the Queen Anne style architecture , a toned-down version of English Baroque mostly used for gentry houses , produced in the actual reign of Queen Anne from 1702 to 1714 . It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",
  "/wiki/Architectural_style": "An architectural style is characterized by the features that make a building or other structure notable or historically identifiable . It is a sub-class of style in the visual arts generally , and most styles in architecture related closely to the wider contemporary artistic style . A style may include such elements as form , method of construction , building materials , and regional character . Most architecture can be classified within a chronology of styles which changes over time reflecting changing fashions , beliefs and religions , or the emergence of new ideas , technology , or materials which make new styles possible . Styles therefore emerge from the history of a society . They are documented in the subject of architectural history . At any time several styles may be fashionable , and when a style changes it usually does so gradually , as architects learn and adapt to new ideas . The new style is sometimes only a rebellion against an existing style , such as post-modernism ( meaning after modernism ) , which in 21st century has found its own language and split into a number of styles which have acquired other names . Architectural Styles often spread to other places , so that the style at its source continues to develop in new ways while other countries follow with their own twist . For instance , Renaissance ideas emerged in Italy around 1425 and spread to all of Europe over the next 200 years , with the French , German , English , and Spanish Renaissances showing recognisably the same style , but with unique characteristics . An architectural style may also spread through colonialism , either by foreign colonies learning from their home country , or by settlers moving to a new land . One example is the Spanish missions in California , brought by Spanish priests in the late 18th century and built in a unique style .",

  "/wiki/Consumer_cooperative": "Consumer cooperatives rose to prominence during the industrial revolution as part of the labour movement . As employment moved to industrial areas and job sectors declined , workers began organizing and controlling businesses for themselves . Workers cooperative were originally sparked by critical reaction to industrial capitalism and the excesses of the industrial revolution . The formation of some workers cooperatives were designed to cope with the evils of unbridled capitalism and the insecurities of wage labor . The first documented consumer cooperative was founded in 1769 , in a barely furnished cottage in Fenwick , East Ayrshire , when local weavers manhandled a sack of oatmeal into John Walker 's whitewashed front room and began selling the contents at a discount , forming the Fenwick Weavers ' Society . In the decades that followed , several cooperatives or cooperative societies formed including Lennoxtown Friendly Victualling Society , founded in 1812 . The philosophy that underpinned the cooperative movement stemmed from the socialist writings of thinkers including Robert Owen and Charles Fourier . Robert Owen , considered by many as the father of the cooperative movement , made his fortune in the cotton trade , but believed in putting his workers in a good environment with access to education for themselves and their children . These ideas were put into effect successfully in the cotton mills of New Lanark , Scotland . It was here that the first co-operative store was opened . Spurred on by the success of this , he had the idea of forming villages of co-operation where workers would drag themselves out of poverty by growing their own food , making their own clothes and ultimately becoming self-governing . He tried to form such communities in Orbiston in Scotland and in New Harmony , Indiana in the United States of America , but both communities failed .",
  "/wiki/Labor_union": "A trade union ( or a labor union in the U.S. ) is an association of workers forming a legal unit or legal personhood , usually called a bargaining unit , which acts as bargaining agent and legal representative for a unit of employees in all matters of law or right arising from or in the administration of a collective agreement . Labour unions typically fund the formal organization , head office , and legal team functions of the labour union through regular fees or union dues . The delegate staff of the labour union representation in the workforce are made up of workplace volunteers who are appointed by members in democratic elections . Today , unions are usually formed for the purpose of securing improvement in pay , benefits , working conditions , or social and political status through collective bargaining by the increased bargaining power wielded by the banding of the workers . The trade union , through an elected leadership and bargaining committee , bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ( rank and file members ) and negotiates labour contracts ( collective bargaining ) with employers . The most common purpose of these associations or unions is maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment . This may include the negotiation of wages , work rules , occupational health and safety standards , complaint procedures , rules governing status of employees including promotions , just cause conditions for termination , and employment benefits . Unions may organize a particular section of skilled workers ( craft unionism ) , a cross-section of workers from various trades ( general unionism ) , or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry ( industrial unionism ) . The agreements negotiated by a union are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers . Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning . Originating in Great Britain , trade unions became popular in many countries during the Industrial Revolution . Trade unions may be composed of individual workers , professionals , past workers , students , apprentices or the unemployed .",
