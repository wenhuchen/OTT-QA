Under United States copyright law , all software is copyright protected , in both source code and object code forms , unless that software was developed by the United States Government , in which case it can not be copyrighted . Authors of copyrighted software can donate their software to the public domain , in which case it is also not covered by copyright and , as a result , can not be licensed . A typical software license grants the licensee , typically an end-user , permission to use one or more copies of software in ways where such a use would otherwise potentially constitute copyright infringement of the software owner 's exclusive rights under copyright .",

  "/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States and its principal federal law enforcement agency . Operating under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Justice , the FBI is also a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence . A leading U.S. counter-terrorism , counterintelligence , and criminal investigative organization , the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes . Although many of the FBI 's functions are unique , its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and the Russian FSB . Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad , the FBI is primarily a domestic agency , maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States , and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation . At an FBI field office , a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence . Despite its domestic focus , the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint , operating 60 Legal Attache ( LEGAT ) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe . These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries . The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas , just as the CIA has a limited domestic function ; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies . The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation , the BOI or BI for short . Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in 1935 . The FBI headquarters is the J. Edgar Hoover Building , located in Washington , D.C .",

  "/wiki/Command-line_interface": "A command-line interface ( CLI ) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text . The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor . Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services . Such access was primarily provided to users by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s , and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on VAX/VMS , Unix systems and personal computer systems including DOS , CP/M and Apple DOS . Today , users rely upon graphical user interfaces and menu-driven interactions . However some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and may still use a command line . Alternatives to the command line interface include text user interface menus ( for example , IBM AIX SMIT ) , keyboard shortcuts , and various desktop metaphors centered on the pointer ( usually controlled with a mouse ) . Examples of this include the Microsoft Windows , DosShell , and Mouse Systems PowerPanel . Command line interfaces are often implemented in terminal devices that are also capable of screen-oriented text user interfaces that use cursor addressing to place symbols on a display screen . Programs with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting . Many software systems implement command line interfaces for control and operation . This includes programming environments and utility programs .",
  "/wiki/BSD_licenses": "BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses , imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software . This is in contrast to copyleft licenses , which have share-alike requirements . The original BSD license was used for its namesake , the Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , a Unix-like operating system . The original version has since been revised , and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses . BSD is both a license and a class of license ( generally referred to as BSD-like ) . The modified BSD license ( in wide use today ) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix . The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code format , or reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format . The BSD license ( unlike some other licenses ) does not require that source code be distributed at all .",

  "/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License": "The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or GPL ) is a widely used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run , study , share , and modify the software . The license was originally written by Richard Stallman , former head of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , for the GNU Project , and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition . The GPL is a copyleft license , which means that derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms . This is in distinction to permissive software licenses , of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples . GPL was the first copyleft license for general use . Historically , the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the free and open-source software domain . Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) . David A. Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems , giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free , rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community . In 2007 , the third version of the license ( GPLv3 ) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version ( GPLv2 ) which were discovered during the latter 's long-time usage . To keep the license up to date , the GPL license includes an optional any later version clause , allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new versions as updated by the FSF . Developers can omit it when licensing their software ; the Linux kernel , for instance , is licensed under GPLv2 without the any later version clause .",
