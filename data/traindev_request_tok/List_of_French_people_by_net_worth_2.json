Chanel is a luxury company that focuses on high fashion and ready-made clothes , luxury products , and accessories . In her youth , Gabrielle Chanel gained the nickname Coco from her time as a chanteuse . As a fashion designer , Coco Chanel catered to women 's taste for elegance in dress , with blouses and suits , trousers and dresses , and jewellery ( gemstone and bijouterie ) of simple design , that replaced the opulent , over-designed , and constrictive clothes and accessories of 19th-century fashion . The Chanel product brands have been personified by male and female fashion models , idols and actresses , including In\u00e8s de La Fressange , Catherine Deneuve , Carole Bouquet , Vanessa Paradis , Nicole Kidman , Jackie Kennedy , Anna Mouglalis , Audrey Tautou , Keira Knightley , Kristen Stewart , Pharrell Williams , Cara Delevingne , Jennie Kim , and Marilyn Monroe . Chanel is well-known for the perfume No . 5 de Chanel and Chanel Suit . Chanel 's use of jersey fabric produced garments that were comfortable and affordable . Chanel revolutionized fashion - high fashion ( haute couture ) and everyday fashion ( pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter ) - by replacing structured-silhouettes , based upon the corset and the bodice , with garments that were functional and at the same time flattering to the woman 's figure . In the 1920s , the simple-line designs of Chanel couture made popular the flat-chested fashions that were the opposite of the hourglass-figure achieved by the fashions of the late 19th century - the Belle \u00c9poque of France ( ca . 1890-1914 ) , and the British Edwardian era ( ca . 1901-1919 ) .",
