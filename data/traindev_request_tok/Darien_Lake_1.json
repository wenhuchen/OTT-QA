  "/wiki/Space_Shot_(ride)": "Space Shot is a type of amusement ride manufactured by S & S Worldwide . The ride is a drop tower type attraction that uses compressed air to rapidly propel riders up the tower then gently lower them with a series of air-cushioned bounces back to the loading platform . The first space shot to be built in the United States was the Detonator at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City , Missouri . It was also the first in the world to feature twin-towers . The tallest space shot in the world is the La Venganza del Enigma in Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid ( 115m )",
  "/wiki/Drop_Tower": "A drop tower or big drop is a type of amusement ride incorporating a central structure or tower . Drop towers vary in height , passenger capacity , lift type , and brake type . Many are custom-made , although there are some mass-produced designs . Riders experience free-fall initially , followed by rapid heavy deceleration . With most drop towers , a gondola carrying riders is lifted to the top of a large vertical structure , then released to free-fall down the tower . Brakes activate to slow the gondola as it approaches the bottom of the ride . Some designs expand on this concept with features such as rotating gondolas , or several bounces before coming to rest . Most drop towers require child riders to exceed a minimum height ; limits vary widely depending upon the nature of the tower , with a 30-foot ( 9 m ) tower for smaller children from 37 inches ( 95 cm ) tall , and a 115-foot ( 35 m ) tower having a 51-inch ( 130 cm ) restriction . Drop towers use a magnetic braking system to slow the carriage quickly and smoothly once it reaches the bottom of the tower . This system is fail-safe because magnets do not need to be powered by electricity or other sources ; they work intrinsically by the laws of magnetism .",

This is only considered to a precursor , however , as the mechanism used to lift the arm up and down as well as the over all look of the ride is much different from a typical Enterprise . The ride is named after USS Enterprise from the TV series Star Trek . The backdrop is decorated with space-themed art and a silhouette of the starship Enterprise .

The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland , built in 1959 , was Arrow 's first roller coaster project . In 1975 , Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track Corkscrew , at Knott 's Berry Farm that sent riders through a series of corkscrews .
