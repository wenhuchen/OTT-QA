  "/wiki/The_Seekers_(rapturists)": "The Seekers , also called The Brotherhood of the Seven Rays , were a group of rapturists or a UFO religion in mid-twentieth century Midwestern United States . The Seekers met in a nondenominational church , the group originally organized in 1953 by Charles Laughead , a staff member at Michigan State University in East Lansing , Michigan . They were led by Dorothy Martin from the Chicago area ( also called Sister Thedra ) , who believed a UFO would take them on December 21 , 1954 . They are believed to be the first such group to exist . They were the subject of the book When Prophecy Fails by Leon Festinger ; Laughead was given the pseudonym Dr. Armstrong and Martin given the name Marian Keech . Leon Festinger infiltrated the Seekers with the goal of studying their cognitions and reactions when their beliefs failed , hence the name of his book When Prophecy Fails . He focused on them primarily to study a thought-process known as cognitive dissonance . Festinger and his colleagues essentially wanted to study cult members reactions and coping mechanisms when the UFO did not come to get them on December 21st , 1954 . When the UFO did n't come , a majority of the members became convinced that the UFO would come on Christmas Eve . It was the second time around that the members experienced the greatest amount of dissonance . In the book , Festinger and his colleagues write The experiences of this observer well characterize the state of affairs following the Christmas caroling episode - a persistent , frustrating search for orders . After this incident , many of the members returned home and abandoned their initial belief .",

The Church of Scientology says that a human is an immortal , spiritual being ( thetan ) that is resident in a physical body . The thetan has had innumerable past lives and it is observed in advanced Scientology texts that lives preceding the thetan 's arrival on Earth were lived in extraterrestrial cultures . Based on case studies at advanced levels , it is predicted that any Scientologist undergoing auditing will eventually come across and recount a common series of events . Hubbard describes the etymology of the word Scientology as coming from the Latin word scio , meaning know or distinguish , and the Greek word logos , meaning the word or outward form by which the inward thought is expressed and made known . Hubbard writes , thus , Scientology means knowing about knowing , or science of knowledge . Hubbard 's groups have encountered considerable opposition and controversy .

  "/wiki/Philo_Drummond": "The Church of the SubGenius is a parody religion that satirizes better-known belief systems . It teaches a complex philosophy that focuses on J. R. Bob Dobbs , purportedly a salesman from the 1950s , who is revered as a prophet by the Church . SubGenius leaders have developed detailed narratives about Dobbs and his relationship to various gods and conspiracies . Their central deity , Jehovah 1 , is accompanied by other gods drawn from ancient myth and popular fiction . SubGenius literature describes a grand conspiracy that seeks to brainwash the world and oppress Dobbs ' followers . In its narratives , the Church presents a blend of cultural references in an elaborate remix of the sources . Ivan Stang , who co-founded the Church of the SubGenius in the 1970s , serves as its leader and publicist . He has imitated actions of other religious leaders , using the tactic of culture jamming in an attempt to undermine better-known faiths . Church leaders instruct their followers to avoid mainstream commercialism and the belief in absolute truths . The group holds that the quality of Slack is of utmost importance - it is never clearly defined . The number of followers is unknown , although the Church 's message has been welcomed by college students and artists in the United States . The group is often compared to Discordianism ."
