It contains the Saguenay Fjord , the estuary of the Saguenay River , stretching through much of the region . It is also known as Sagamie in French , from the first part of Saguenay and the last part of Piekouagami , the Innu name ( meaning flat lake ) for Lac Saint-Jean , with the final e added to follow the model of other existing region names such as Mauricie , T\u00e9miscamie , Jam\u00e9sie , and Matawinie . The name Saguenay is possibly derived from the Innu word Saki-nip which means where water flows out . With a land area of 98,712.71 km2 ( 38,113.9 sq mi ) , the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean is , after the Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec and C\u00f4te-Nord regions , the third-largest of Quebec regions in the area . This region is bathed by two major watercourses , Lac Saint-Jean and the Saguenay River , both of which mark its landscape deeply and have been the main drives of its development in history . It is also irrigated by several other large watercourses . Bordered by forests and mountainous massifs , the southern portion of the region constitutes a fertile enclave in the Canadian Shield called the Saguenay Graben . Both the scenery and the cultural sites and activities of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean attract tourists every year . Lac Saint-Jean is a popular vacation destination in the summer for residents of the more urban regions of Quebec . The region is considered the heartland of the Quebec sovereignty movement . The beauty of the region can be seen in the 1991 film Black Robe , directed by Bruce Beresford .",
