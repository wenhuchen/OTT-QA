  "/wiki/George_I_of_Great_Britain": "George I ( George Louis ; German : Georg Ludwig ; 28 May 1660 - 11 June 1727 ) [ a ] was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 1 August 1714 and ruler of the Duchy and Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( Hanover ) in the Holy Roman Empire from 23 January 1698 until his death in 1727 . He was the first British monarch of the House of Hanover . Born in Hanover to its Elector Ernest Augustus and Electress Sophia , George inherited the titles and lands of the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg from his father and uncles . A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime ; he was ratified as prince-elector of Hanover in 1708 . After the deaths in 1714 of his mother and his second cousin Anne , Queen of Great Britain ( r. 1702-1714 ) , George ascended the British throne as Anne 's closest living Protestant relative under the Act of Settlement 1701 . Jacobites attempted , but failed , to depose George and replace him with James Francis Edward Stuart , Anne 's Catholic half-brother . During George 's reign , the powers of the monarchy diminished and Britain began a transition to the modern system of cabinet government led by a prime minister . Towards the end of his reign , actual political power was held by Robert Walpole , now recognised as Britain 's first de facto prime minister . George died of a stroke on a trip to his native Hanover , where he was buried . He is the most recent British monarch to be buried outside the United Kingdom .",

These arms are used by the Queen in her official capacity as monarch of the United Kingdom . Variants of the Royal Arms are used by other members of the British royal family , by the British Government in connection with the administration and government of the country , and some courts and legislatures in a number of Commonwealth realms . In Scotland , there exists a separate version of the Royal Arms , a variant of which is used by the Scotland Office and the Judiciary . The arms in banner form serve as basis for the monarch 's official flag , known as the Royal Standard . In the standard variant used outside of Scotland , the shield is quartered , depicting in the first and fourth quarters the three passant guardant lions of England ; in the second , the rampant lion and double tressure flory-counterflory of Scotland ; and in the third , a harp for Ireland . The crest is a statant guardant lion wearing the St Edward 's Crown , himself on another representation of that crown . The dexter supporter is a likewise crowned English lion ; the sinister , a Scottish unicorn . According to legend a free unicorn was considered a very dangerous beast ; therefore the heraldic unicorn is chained , as were both supporting unicorns in the royal coat of arms of Scotland . In the greenery below , a thistle , Tudor rose and shamrock are depicted , representing Scotland , England and Ireland respectively . This armorial achievement comprises the motto , in French , of English monarchs , Dieu et mon Droit ( God and my Right ) , which has descended to the present royal family as well as the Garter circlet which surrounds the shield , inscribed with the Order 's motto , in French , Honi soit qui mal y pense ( Shame on him who thinks evil ) .

  "/wiki/George_III_of_Great_Britain": "George III ( George William Frederick ; 4 June 1738 [ c ] - 29 January 1820 ) was King of Great Britain and King of Ireland from 25 October 1760 until the union of the two countries on 1 January 1801 , after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death in 1820 . He was concurrently Duke and Prince-elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg ( Hanover ) in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814 . He was a monarch of the House of Hanover , but unlike his two predecessors , he was born in Great Britain , spoke English as his first language , and never visited Hanover . George 's life and reign , which were longer than those of any of his predecessors , were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms , much of the rest of Europe , and places farther afield in Africa , the Americas , and Asia . Early in his reign , Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years ' War , becoming the dominant European power in North America and India . However , many of Britain 's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence . Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 . In the later part of his life , George had recurrent , and eventually permanent , mental illness . Although it has since been suggested that he had bipolar disorder or the blood disease porphyria , the cause of his illness remains unknown . After a final relapse in 1810 , a regency was established . His eldest son , George , Prince of Wales , ruled as Prince Regent until his father 's death , when he succeeded as George IV . Historical analysis of George III 's life has gone through a kaleidoscope of changing views that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them .",

He was the arch-rival of the Tory politician William Pitt the Younger . His father Henry Fox , 1st Baron Holland , a leading Whig of his day , had similarly been the great rival of Pitt 's famous father William Pitt , 1st Earl of Chatham ( Pitt the Elder ) . Fox rose to prominence in the House of Commons as a forceful and eloquent speaker with a notorious and colourful private life , though his opinions were rather conservative and conventional . However , with the coming of the American War of Independence and the influence of the Whig Edmund Burke , Fox 's opinions evolved into some of the most radical ever to be aired in the Parliament of his era . Fox became a prominent and staunch opponent of George III , whom he regarded as an aspiring tyrant ; he supported the American Patriots , even dressing in the colours of George Washington 's army . Briefly serving as Britain 's first Foreign Secretary in the ministry of the Marquess of Rockingham in 1782 , he returned to the post in a coalition government with his old enemy Lord North in 1783 . However , the King forced Fox and North out of government before the end of the year , replacing them with the twenty-four-year-old Pitt the Younger , and Fox spent the following twenty-two years facing Pitt and the government benches from across the Commons . Though Fox had little interest in the actual exercise of power and spent almost the entirety of his political career in opposition , he became noted as an anti-slavery campaigner , a supporter of the French Revolution , and a leading parliamentary advocate of religious tolerance and individual liberty . His friendship with his mentor Burke and his parliamentary credibility were both casualties of Fox 's support for France during the Revolutionary Wars , but he went on to attack Pitt 's wartime legislation and to defend the liberty of religious minorities and political radicals . After Pitt 's death in January 1806 , Fox served briefly as Foreign Secretary in the 'Ministry of All the Talents ' of William Grenville , before he died on 13 September 1806 , aged 57 .",

It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present . [ a ] It was the first public national museum in the world . The British Museum was established in 1753 , largely based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane . It first opened to the public in 1759 , in Montagu House , on the site of the current building . Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions , the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881 . In 1973 , the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum , but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997 .

  "/wiki/Joseph_Priestley": "Joseph Priestley FRS ( /\u02c8pri\u02d0stli/ ; 24 March [ O.S . 13 March ] 1733 - 6 February 1804 ) was an 18th-century English Separatist theologian , natural philosopher , chemist , innovative grammarian , multi-subject educator , and liberal political theorist who published over 150 works . He has historically been credited with the discovery of oxygen , having isolated it in its gaseous state , although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Antoine Lavoisier also have strong claims to the discovery . During his lifetime , Priestley 's considerable scientific reputation rested on his invention of carbonated water , his writings on electricity , and his discovery of several airs ( gases ) , the most famous being what Priestley dubbed dephlogisticated air ( oxygen ) . However , Priestley 's determination to defend phlogiston theory and to reject what would become the chemical revolution eventually left him isolated within the scientific community . Priestley 's science was integral to his theology , and he consistently tried to fuse Enlightenment rationalism with Christian theism . In his metaphysical texts , Priestley attempted to combine theism , materialism , and determinism , a project that has been called audacious and original . He believed that a proper understanding of the natural world would promote human progress and eventually bring about the Christian millennium . Priestley , who strongly believed in the free and open exchange of ideas , advocated toleration and equal rights for religious Dissenters , which also led him to help found Unitarianism in England . The controversial nature of Priestley 's publications , combined with his outspoken support of the French Revolution , aroused public and governmental suspicion ; he was eventually forced to flee in 1791 , first to London and then to the United States , after a mob burned down his Birmingham home and church . He spent his last ten years in Northumberland County , Pennsylvania . A scholar and teacher throughout his life , Priestley also made significant contributions to pedagogy , including the publication of a seminal work on English grammar and books on history , and he prepared some of the most influential early timelines .",

Woolf was born into an affluent household in South Kensington , London , the seventh child in a blended family of eight . Her mother , Julia Prinsep Jackson , celebrated as a Pre-Raphaelite artist 's model , had three children from her first marriage , while Woolf 's father , Leslie Stephen , a notable man of letters , had one previous daughter . The Stephens produced another four children , including the modernist painter Vanessa Bell . While the boys in the family received college educations , the girls were home-schooled in English classics and Victorian literature . An important influence in Virginia Woolf 's early life was the summer home the family used in St Ives , Cornwall , where she first saw the Godrevy Lighthouse , which was to become central in her novel To the Lighthouse ( 1927 ) . Woolf 's childhood came to an abrupt end in 1895 with the death of her mother and her first mental breakdown , followed two years later by the death of her half-sister and a mother figure to her , Stella Duckworth . From 1897 to 1901 , she attended the Ladies ' Department of King 's College London , where she studied classics and history and came into contact with early reformers of women 's higher education and the women 's rights movement . Other important influences were her Cambridge-educated brothers and unfettered access to her father 's vast library . Encouraged by her father , Woolf began writing professionally in 1900 . Her father 's death in 1905 caused another mental breakdown for Woolf . Following his death , the Stephen family moved from Kensington to the more bohemian Bloomsbury , where they adopted a free-spirited lifestyle .",
