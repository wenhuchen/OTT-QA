  "/wiki/Almaraz": "Almaraz is a town in C\u00e1ceres Province , Extremadura , Spain . As of 2005 , its population is 1,295 . It is on the European route E90 . It is the home of the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant . A solar power macroplant is being built in the town . The bridge over the Tagus at Almaraz was built by Emperor Carlos I in the 16th Century and was known by the local people as the Albalat Bridge ; however , it was destroyed by the Spanish on March 14 , 1809 , to prevent its use by the French during the Peninsular War . In the Battle of Almaraz on 18/19 May 1812 , the Anglo-Portuguese Army under Lord Hill destroyed a French pontoon bridge across the Tagus which was protected by two French garrisons at either end . Later , the old bridge at Almaraz has been repaired and can be driven across .",
  "/wiki/Pressurized_water_reactor": "Pressurized water reactors ( PWRs ) constitute the large majority of the world 's nuclear power plants ( notable exceptions being Japan and Canada ) and are one of three types of light-water reactor ( LWR ) , the other types being boiling water reactors ( BWRs ) and supercritical water reactors ( SCWRs ) . In a PWR , the primary coolant ( water ) is pumped under high pressure to the reactor core where it is heated by the energy released by the fission of atoms . The heated water then flows to a steam generator where it transfers its thermal energy to a secondary system where steam is generated and flows to turbines which , in turn , spin an electric generator . In contrast to a boiling water reactor , pressure in the primary coolant loop prevents the water from boiling within the reactor . All LWRs use ordinary water as both coolant and neutron moderator . PWRs were originally designed to serve as nuclear marine propulsion for nuclear submarines and were used in the original design of the second commercial power plant at Shippingport Atomic Power Station . PWRs currently operating in the United States are considered Generation II reactors . Russia 's VVER reactors are similar to U.S. PWRs . France operates many PWRs to generate the bulk of its electricity .",

  "/wiki/BWR": "A boiling water reactor ( BWR ) is a type of light water nuclear reactor used for the generation of electrical power . It is the second most common type of electricity-generating nuclear reactor after the pressurized water reactor ( PWR ) , which is also a type of light water nuclear reactor . The main difference between a BWR and PWR is that in a BWR , the reactor core heats water , which turns to steam and then drives a steam turbine . In a PWR , the reactor core heats water , which does not boil . This hot water then exchanges heat with a lower pressure water system , which turns to steam and drives the turbine . The BWR was developed by the Argonne National Laboratory and General Electric ( GE ) in the mid-1950s . The main present manufacturer is GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy , which specializes in the design and construction of this type of reactor .",

It consists of one boiling water reactor ( BWR ) of 466 megawatts ( MWe ) . The reactor vessel was built in 1966 by the Dutch RDM. , being the oldest Spanish Nuclear Power Plant in service . The reactor is a BWR/3 model with a Mark I containment building . The plant was opened in 1971 and officially closed on 5 July 2013 . Nuclenor , the plant 's operator , had sought a ten-year extension , which was supported by Spain 's Nuclear Safety Council ( Consejo de Seguridad Nuclear , CSN ) despite Spain 's policy of phasing out nuclear power . On 2 July 2009 , the Ministry of Industry , Tourism and Trade compromised , extending the operating license for an additional four years subject to safety upgrades , though this extension was never used . On December 16 , 2012 , the plant operator Nuclenor has begun shutting down the nuclear power plant , which was due to close in mid-2013 , to avoid producing taxable power during 2013 . The decision was spurred by an impending law , which would impose a tax in the annual sum of about \u20ac150 million . The safety upgrades required for extension of the operation would have cost some \u20ac120 million . On May 2014 , following a change in national law allowing mothballed nuclear power stations restart , Nuclenor submitted a request to renew the operating licence , allowing to operate the plant until 2 March 2031 . On July 2014 , Nuclenor was fined \u20ac18.4 million by the Spanish National Commission on Financial Markets and Competition ( CNMC ) , for having shut down the reactor in December 2012 , months before its operational licence was due to expire on 6 July 2013 .",

  "/wiki/Gas_cooled_reactor": "A gas-cooled reactor ( GCR ) is a nuclear reactor that uses graphite as a neutron moderator and carbon dioxide as coolant . Although there are many other types of reactor cooled by gas , the terms GCR and to a lesser extent gas cooled reactor are particularly used to refer to this type of reactor . The GCR was able to use natural uranium as fuel , enabling the countries that developed them to fabricate their own fuel without relying on other countries for supplies of enriched uranium , which was at the time of their development in the 1950s only available from the United States or the Soviet Union ."
