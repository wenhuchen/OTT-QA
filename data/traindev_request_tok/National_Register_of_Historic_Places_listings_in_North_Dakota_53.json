  "/wiki/Missouri_River": "The Missouri River is the longest river in North America . Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana , the Missouri flows east and south for 2,341 miles ( 3,767 km ) before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis , Missouri . The river drains a sparsely populated , semi-arid watershed of more than 500,000 square miles ( 1,300,000 km2 ) , which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces . Although nominally considered a tributary of the Mississippi , the Missouri River above the confluence is much longer and carries a comparable volume of water . When combined with the lower Mississippi River , it forms the world 's fourth longest river system . For over 12,000 years , people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation . More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed , most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous bison herds that roamed through the Great Plains . The first Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century , and the region passed through Spanish and French hands before becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase . The Missouri River was one of the main routes for the westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century . The growth of the fur trade in the early 19th century laid much of the groundwork as trappers explored the region and blazed trails . Pioneers headed west en masse beginning in the 1830s , first by covered wagon , then by the growing numbers of steamboats that entered service on the river . Settlers took over former Native American lands in the watershed , leading to some of the most longstanding and violent wars against indigenous peoples in American history .",
