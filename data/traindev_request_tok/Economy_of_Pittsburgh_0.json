  "/wiki/Health_care": "Health care , health-care , or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention , diagnosis , treatment , recovery , or cure of disease , illness , injury , and other physical and mental impairments in people . Health care is delivered by health professionals in allied health fields . Physicians and physician associates are a part of these health professionals . Dentistry , pharmacy , midwifery , nursing , medicine , optometry , audiology , psychology , occupational therapy , physical therapy , athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care . It includes work done in providing primary care , secondary care , and tertiary care , as well as in public health . Access to health care may vary across countries , communities , and individuals , influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies . Providing health care services means the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes . Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations ( such as insurance coverage ) , geographic barriers ( such as additional transportation costs , possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services ) , and personal limitations ( lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers , poor health literacy , low income ) . Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services , efficacy of treatments , and overall outcome ( well-being , mortality rates ) . Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism , a well-trained and adequately paid workforce , reliable information on which to base decisions and policies , and well maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies . An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country 's economy , development and industrialization .",

  "/wiki/Higher_education": "Higher education is tertiary education leading to award of an academic degree . Higher education , also called post-secondary education , third-level or tertiary education , is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education . It represents levels 6 , 7 and 8 of the 2011 version of the International Standard Classification of Education structure . Tertiary education at a non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education . The right of access to higher education is mentioned in a number of international human rights instruments . The UN International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 declares , in Article 13 , that higher education shall be made equally accessible to all , on the basis of capacity , by every appropriate means , and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education . In Europe , Article 2 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights , adopted in 1950 , obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the right to education Since World War II , developed and many developing countries have increased the participation of the age group who mostly studies higher education from the elite rate , of up to 15 per cent , to the mass rate of 16 to 50 per cent . In many developed countries , participation in higher education has continued to increase towards universal or , what Trow later called , open access , where over half of the relevant age group participate in higher education . Higher education is important to national economies , both as an industry , in its own right , and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy . College educated workers have commanded a measurable wage premium and are much less likely to become unemployed than less educated workers .",

  "/wiki/Steel_manufacturing": "Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and/or scrap . In steelmaking , impurities such as nitrogen , silicon , phosphorus , sulfur and excess carbon ( most important impurity ) are removed from the sourced iron , and alloying elements such as manganese , nickel , chromium , carbon and vanadium are added to produce different grades of steel . Limiting dissolved gases such as nitrogen and oxygen and entrained impurities ( termed inclusions ) in the steel is also important to ensure the quality of the products cast from the liquid steel . Steelmaking has existed for millennia , but it was not commercialized on a massive scale until the late 19th century . An ancient process of steelmaking was the crucible process . In the 1850s and 1860s , the Bessemer process and the Siemens-Martin process turned steelmaking into a heavy industry . Today there are two major commercial processes for making steel , namely basic oxygen steelmaking , which has liquid pig-iron from the blast furnace and scrap steel as the main feed materials , and electric arc furnace ( EAF ) steelmaking , which uses scrap steel or direct reduced iron ( DRI ) as the main feed materials . Oxygen steelmaking is fuelled predominantly by the exothermic nature of the reactions inside the vessel ; in contrast , in EAF steelmaking , electrical energy is used to melt the solid scrap and/or DRI materials . In recent times , EAF steelmaking technology has evolved closer to oxygen steelmaking as more chemical energy is introduced into the process .",

Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn , New York founded by industrialist Charles Pratt in 1887 . In 1912 , the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology ( CIT ) and began offering four-year degrees . During this time , CIT consisted of four constituent schools : the School of Fine and Applied Arts , the School of Apprentices and Journeymen , the School of Science and Technology , and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women .

The company is based at 1095 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan , New York City , but is incorporated in Delaware . In 1984 , the United States Department of Justice mandated AT & T Corporation to break up the Bell System and split into seven companies , each a Regional Bell Operating Company ( RBOC ) , and commonly referred to as Baby Bells . One of the Baby Bells , Bell Atlantic , came into existence in 1984 , consisting of the separate operating companies New Jersey Bell , Bell of Pennsylvania , Diamond State Telephone , and C & P Telephone , with a trading area from New Jersey to Virginia . This company would later become Verizon . As part of a rebranding of the Baby Bells in the mid-1990s , all of Bell Atlantic 's operating companies assumed the holding company 's name . In 1997 , Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX . Although Bell Atlantic was the surviving company name , the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX 's old headquarters in New York City . In 2000 , Bell Atlantic acquired GTE , which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic 's footprint . Bell Atlantic , the surviving entity , changed its name to Verizon , a portmanteau of veritas ( Latin for truth ) and horizon .

  "/wiki/Telecommunications": "Telecommunication is the transmission of signs , signals , messages , words , writings , images and sounds or information of any nature by wire , radio , optical or other electromagnetic systems . Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology . It is transmitted through a transmission medium , such as over physical media , for example , over electrical cable , or via electromagnetic radiation through space such as radio or light . Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing . Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange , the term telecommunications is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies . Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals , such as beacons , smoke signals , semaphore telegraphs , signal flags and optical heliographs . Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats , lung-blown horns , and loud whistles . 20th- and 21st-century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies , such as telegraph , telephone , and teleprinter , networks , radio , microwave transmission , optical fiber , and communications satellites . A revolution in wireless communication began in the first decade of the 20th century with the pioneering developments in radio communications by Guglielmo Marconi , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 , and other notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications . These included Charles Wheatstone and Samuel Morse ( inventors of the telegraph ) , Alexander Graham Bell ( inventor of the telephone ) , Edwin Armstrong and Lee de Forest ( inventors of radio ) , as well as Vladimir K. Zworykin , John Logie Baird and Philo Farnsworth ( some of the inventors of television ) ."
