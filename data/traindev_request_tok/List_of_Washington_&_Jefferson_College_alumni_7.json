[ e ] The civil war began primarily as a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people .

The loyalists of the Union in the North , which also included some geographically western and southern states , proclaimed support for the Constitution . They faced secessionists of the Confederate States in the South , who advocated for states ' rights in order to uphold slavery . Of the 34 U.S. states in February 1861 , seven Southern slave states were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country , and the Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government . The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states , and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority . These states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War . The two remaining slave states , Delaware and Maryland , were invited to join the Confederacy , but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops . The Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the government of the United States , nor by that of any foreign country .

The state 's largest city is Baltimore , and its capital is Annapolis . Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State , the Free State , and the Chesapeake Bay State . It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria , known in England as Queen Mary , who was the wife of King Charles I. Sixteen of Maryland 's twenty-three counties , as well as the city of Baltimore , border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries , which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline . Although one of the smallest states in the U.S. , it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature . In a similar vein , Maryland 's geography , culture , and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic , Northeastern , and South Atlantic regions of the country . Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century , Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans , mostly by the Algonquin , and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux . As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain , Maryland was founded by George Calvert , a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England . In 1632 , Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter , naming the colony after his wife , Queen Mary ( Henrietta Maria of France ) . Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans , who rejected Catholicism in their settlements , Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration . Accordingly , in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion , which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation . Nevertheless , religious strife was common in the early years , and Catholics remained a minority , albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony .",

The territory originally contained approximately 259,824 square miles ( 672,940 km2 ) of land , but its size was decreased when it was subdivided to create the Michigan Territory ( 1805 ) and the Illinois Territory ( 1809 ) . The Indiana Territory was the first new territory created from lands of the Northwest Territory , which had been organized under the terms of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 . The territorial capital was the settlement around the old French fort of Vincennes on the Wabash River , until transferred in to Corydon near the Ohio River in 1813 . William Henry Harrison , the territory 's first governor , oversaw treaty negotiations with the native inhabitants that ceded tribal lands to the U.S. government , opening large parts of the territory to further settlement . In 1809 the U.S. Congress established a bicameral legislative body for the territory that included a popularly-elected House of Representatives and a Legislative Council . In addition , the territorial government began planning for a basic transportation network and education system , but efforts to attain statehood for the territory were delayed due to war . At the outbreak of Tecumseh 's War , when the territory was on the front line of battle , Harrison led a military force in the opening hostilities at the Battle of Tippecanoe ( 1811 ) and in the subsequent invasion of Canada during the War of 1812 . After Harrison resigned as the territorial governor , Thomas Posey was appointed to the vacant governorship , but the opposition party , led by Congressman Jonathan Jennings , dominated territorial affairs in its final years and began pressing for statehood . In June 1816 a constitutional convention was held at Corydon , where a state constitution was adopted on June 29 , 1816 . General elections were held in August to fill offices for the new state government , the new officeholders were sworn into office in November , and the territory was dissolved .

  "/wiki/Reconstruction_Era": "The Reconstruction era was the period in American history which lasted from 1863 to 1877 . It was a significant chapter in the history of American civil rights . The term has two applications : the first applies to the complete history of the entire country from 1865 to 1877 following the American Civil War ; the second , to the attempted transformation of the 11 former Confederate states from 1863 to 1877 , as directed by Congress , and the role of the Union states in that transformation . Reconstruction ended the remnants of Confederate secession and abolished slavery , making the newly freed slaves citizens with civil rights ostensibly guaranteed by three new constitutional amendments . Three visions of Civil War memory appeared during Reconstruction : the reconciliationist vision , which was rooted in coping with the death and devastation the war had brought ; the white supremacist vision , which included segregation and the preservation of the traditional cultural standards of the South ; and the emancipationist vision , which sought full freedom , citizenship , and constitutional equality for African Americans . When President Abraham Lincoln , a Republican , was assassinated at the end of the Civil War , Vice President Andrew Johnson , a Democrat from Tennessee and former slave holder , became president . Johnson favored rapid measures to bring the South back into the Union , allowing the Southern states to determine the rights of former slaves . Radical Republicans in Congress sought stronger , federal measures to upgrade the rights of African Americans , including the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , while curtailing the rights of former Confederates , such as through the provisions of the Wade-Davis Bill . Johnson , the most prominent Southerner to oppose the Confederacy , followed a lenient policy toward ex-Confederates . Lincoln 's last speeches show that he was leaning toward supporting the suffrage of all freedmen , whereas Johnson and the Democratic Party were strongly opposed to this . Johnson 's weak Reconstruction policies prevailed until the congressional elections of 1866 . Those elections followed outbreaks of violence against blacks in the former rebel states , including the Memphis riots of 1866 and the New Orleans massacre of 1866 .",

The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay , which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna . The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond ; Virginia Beach is the most populous city , and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision . The Commonwealth 's estimated population as of 2018 [ update ] is over 8.5 million . The area 's history begins with several indigenous groups , including the Powhatan . In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World . Virginia 's state nickname , the Old Dominion , is a reference to this status . Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony 's early politics and plantation economy . Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution . In the American Civil War , Virginia 's Secession Convention resolved to join the Confederacy , and Virginia 's First Wheeling Convention resolved to remain in the Union ; that led to the creation of West Virginia .

  "/wiki/Confederate_States_Army": "The Confederate States Army was the military land force of the Confederate States of America ( commonly referred to as the Confederacy ) during the American Civil War ( 1861-1865 ) , fighting against the United States forces . On February 28 , 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress established a provisional volunteer army and gave control over military operations and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the newly chosen Confederate president , Jefferson Davis . Davis was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy , and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the Mexican-American War . He had also been a United States Senator from Mississippi and U.S. Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce . On March 1 , 1861 , on behalf of the Confederate government , Davis assumed control of the military situation at Charleston , South Carolina , where South Carolina state militia besieged Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor , held by a small U.S. Army garrison . By March 1861 , the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army . An accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Confederate Army is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records ; estimates of the number of individual Confederate soldiers are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men . This does not include an unknown number of slaves who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army , such as construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons . Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war , they do not represent the size of the army at any given date . These numbers do not include men who served in Confederate States Navy . Although most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers , both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription , primarily as a means to force men to register and to volunteer . In the absence of exact records , estimates of the percentage of Confederate soldiers who were draftees are about double the 6 percent of United States soldiers who were conscripts .",

They were often former officers from the United States Army ( the regular army ) prior to the Civil War , while others were given the rank based on merit or when necessity demanded . Most Confederate generals needed confirmation from the Confederate Congress , much like prospective generals in the modern U.S. armed forces . Like all of the Confederacy 's military forces , these generals answered to their civilian leadership , in particular Jefferson Davis , the South 's president and therefore commander-in-chief of the Army , Navy , and Marines of the Confederate States ."
