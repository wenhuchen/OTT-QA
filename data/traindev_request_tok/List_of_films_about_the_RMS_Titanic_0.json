  "/wiki/Saved_from_the_Titanic": "Saved from the Titanic is a 1912 American silent motion picture short starring Dorothy Gibson , an American film actress who survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15 , 1912 . Premiering in the United States just 29 days after the event , it is the earliest dramatization about the tragedy . Gibson had been one of 28 people aboard the first lifeboat to be launched from Titanic and was rescued about five and a half hours after leaving the ship . On returning to New York City , she co-wrote the script and played a fictionalized version of herself . The plot involves her recounting the story of the disaster to her fictional parents and fianc\u00e9 , with the footage interspersed with stock footage of icebergs , Titanic 's sister ship Olympic and the ship 's captain , Edward Smith . To add to the film 's authenticity , Gibson wore the same clothes as on the night of the disaster . The filming took place in a Fort Lee , New Jersey studio and aboard a derelict ship in New York Harbor . The film was released internationally and attracted large audiences and positive reviews , though some criticized it for commercializing the tragedy so soon after the event . It is now regarded as a lost film , as the last known prints were destroyed in the \u00c9clair studio fire in March 1914 . Only a few printed stills and promotional photos are known to survive . It is Gibson 's penultimate film , as she reportedly suffered a mental breakdown after completing it .",

  "/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic": "The RMS Titanic sank in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean , four days into the ship 's maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City . The largest ocean liner in service at the time , Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg at around 23:40 ( ship 's time ) [ a ] on Sunday , 14 April 1912 . Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 ( ship 's time ; 05:18 GMT ) on Monday , 15 April , resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people , making it one of the deadliest peacetime marine disasters in history . Titanic received six warnings of sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted the iceberg . Unable to turn quickly enough , the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard side and opened six of her sixteen compartments to the sea ( the forepeak , all three holds , and boiler rooms 5 and 6 ) . Titanic had been designed to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more , and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink . They used distress flares and radio ( wireless ) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats . In accordance with existing practice , Titanic 's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels , not to hold everyone on board simultaneously ; therefore , with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away , there was no safe refuge for many of the passengers and crew . Compounding this , poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full . As a result , when Titanic sank , over a thousand passengers and crew were still on board . Almost all those who jumped or fell into the water either drowned or died within minutes due to the effects of cold shock and incapacitation . RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene about an hour and a half after the sinking and rescued the last of the survivors by 09:15 on 15 April , some nine and a half hours after the collision .",

  "/wiki/Silent_film": "A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound ( and in particular , no audible dialogue ) . In silent films for entertainment , the plot may be conveyed by the use of title cards , written indications of the plot and key dialogue lines . The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself , but because of the technical challenges involved , the introduction of synchronized dialogue became practical only in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the advent of the Vitaphone system . The term silent film is something of a misnomer , as these films were almost always accompanied by live sounds . During the silent era that existed from the mid-1890s to the late 1920s , a pianist , theater organist - or even , in large cities , a small orchestra - would often play music to accompany the films . Pianists and organists would play either from sheet music , or improvisation . Sometimes a person would even narrate the intertitle cards for the audience . Though at the time the technology to synchronize sound with the video did not exist , music was seen as an essential part of the viewing experience . The term is also frequently used to describe sound-era films that have a recorded music-only soundtrack without dialogue , such as City Lights and The Artist . The term silent film is a retronym - a term created to retroactively distinguish something . Early sound films , starting with The Jazz Singer in 1927 , were variously referred to as the talkies , sound films , or talking pictures . Within a decade , the widespread production of silent films for popular entertainment had ceased , and the industry had moved fully into the sound era , in which movies were accompanied by synchronized sound recordings of spoken dialogue , music and sound effects .",

  "/wiki/Sound_film": "A sound film is a motion picture with synchronized sound , or sound technologically coupled to image , as opposed to a silent film . The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900 , but decades passed before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical . Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems , and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate . Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology , which took place in 1923 . The primary steps in the commercialization of sound cinema were taken in the mid- to late 1920s . At first , the sound films which included synchronized dialogue , known as talking pictures , or talkies , were exclusively shorts . The earliest feature-length movies with recorded sound included only music and effects . The first feature film originally presented as a talkie was The Jazz Singer , released in October 1927 . A major hit , it was made with Vitaphone , which was at the time the leading brand of sound-on-disc technology . Sound-on-film , however , would soon become the standard for talking pictures . By the early 1930s , the talkies were a global phenomenon .

While many other shipping lines focused primarily on speed , White Star branded their services by focusing more on providing steady and comfortable passages , for both upper class travellers and immigrants . Today , it is most famous for the innovative vessel Oceanic of 1870 , and for the losses of some of their best passenger liners , including the wrecking of RMS Atlantic at Halifax in 1873 , the sinking of RMS Republic off Nantucket in 1909 , the loss of RMS Titanic in 1912 and HMHS Britannic in 1916 while serving as a hospital ship . Despite its casualties , the company retained a prominent hold on shipping markets around the globe before falling into decline during the Great Depression , which ultimately led to a merger with its chief rival , Cunard Line , which operated as Cunard-White Star Line until 1950 .

Despite the fact that there already was a German silent film produced in 1912 just four weeks after the sinking and a British company had released a German-language film about the disaster in 1929 , the film was commissioned by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels with the intent of showing not only the superiority of German filmmaking , but also as a propaganda vehicle which would show that British and American capitalism was responsible for the disaster . The addition of an entirely fictional heroic German officer to the ship 's crew was intended to demonstrate the superior bravery and selflessness of German men as compared to the British officers . The film 's original director , Herbert Selpin , was arrested during production after speaking out against the Nazi regime - he was later found hanged in prison - and the film was completed by Werner Klingler , who was not credited . [ citation needed ] Although the film had a brief theatrical run in parts of German-occupied Europe starting in November 1943 , it was not shown within Germany by order of Goebbels , who feared that it would weaken the German citizenry 's morale instead of improving it . Goebbels later banned the playing of the film entirely , and it did not have a second run .

He was one of Adolf Hitler 's closest and most devoted associates , and was known for his skills in public speaking and his deeply virulent antisemitism , which was evident in his publicly voiced views . He advocated progressively harsher discrimination , including the extermination of the Jews in the Holocaust . Goebbels , who aspired to be an author , obtained a Doctor of Philology degree from the University of Heidelberg in 1921 . He joined the Nazi Party in 1924 , and worked with Gregor Strasser in their northern branch . He was appointed Gauleiter ( district leader ) for Berlin in 1926 , where he began to take an interest in the use of propaganda to promote the party and its programme . After the Nazis ' seizure of power in 1933 , Goebbels 's Propaganda Ministry quickly gained and exerted control over the news media , arts , and information in Germany . He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes . Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism , attacks on the Christian churches , and ( after the start of the Second World War ) attempting to shape morale . In 1943 , Goebbels began to pressure Hitler to introduce measures that would produce total war , including closing businesses not essential to the war effort , conscripting women into the labour force , and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht . Hitler finally appointed him as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War on 23 July 1944 , whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures to increase the number of people available for armaments manufacture and the Wehrmacht .

In particular , it played a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign , the Battle of Britain . The RAF 's mission is to support the objectives of the British Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) , which are to provide the capabilities needed to ensure the security and defence of the United Kingdom and overseas territories , including against terrorism ; to support the Government 's foreign policy objectives particularly in promoting international peace and security . The RAF describes its mission statement as . [ to provide ] an agile , adaptable and capable Air Force that , person for person , is second to none , and that makes a decisive air power contribution in support of the UK Defence Mission . The mission statement is supported by the RAF 's definition of air power , which guides its strategy . Air power is defined as the ability to project power from the air and space to influence the behaviour of people or the course of events . Today the Royal Air Force maintains an operational fleet of various types of aircraft , described by the RAF as being leading-edge in terms of technology . This largely consists of fixed-wing aircraft , including : fighter and strike aircraft , airborne early warning and control aircraft , ISTAR and SIGINT aircraft , aerial refueling aircraft and strategic and tactical transport aircraft .",
  "/wiki/Neuengamme_concentration_camp": "The Neuengamme concentration camp was a network of Nazi German concentration camps in Northern Germany that consisted of the main camp , Neuengamme , and its over 85 satellite camps . Established in 1938 near the village of Neuengamme in the Bergedorf district of Hamburg , the Neuengamme camp became the largest concentration camp in Northwest Germany . Over 100,000 prisoners came through Neuengamme and its subcamps , 24 of which were for women . The verified death toll is 42,900 : 14,000 in the main camp , 12,800 in the subcamps , and 16,100 in the death marches and bombings during the final weeks of World War II . Following Germany 's defeat in 1945 , the British Army used the site as an internment camp for SS and other Nazi officials . In 1948 , the British transferred the land to the Free Hanseatic City of Hamburg , which summarily demolished the camp 's wooden barracks and built in its stead a prison cell block , converting the former concentration camp site into two state prisons operated by the Hamburg authorities from 1950 to 2004 . Following protests by various groups of survivors and allies , the site now serves as a memorial . It is situated 15 km southeast of the centre of Hamburg .",

  "/wiki/IMAX": "IMAX is a proprietary system of high-resolution cameras , film formats , film projectors , and theaters known for having very large screens with a tall aspect ratio ( approximately 1.43:1 & 1.90:1 ) and steep stadium seating . Graeme Ferguson , Roman Kroitor , Robert Kerr , and William C. Shaw were the co-founders of what would be named the IMAX Corporation ( founded in September 1967 as Multiscreen Corporation , Limited ) , and they developed the first IMAX cinema projection standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Canada . Unlike conventional film projectors , the film runs horizontally so that the image width can be greater than the width of the film stock . When IMAX was introduced , it was a radical change in the movie-going experience . Viewers were treated to the scene of a gently-curved giant screen more than seven stories tall ( 75 feet ( 23 m ) , with the tallest measuring 117 feet ( 36 m ) ) and steep stadium seating that made for a visually immersive experience . This was enhanced by a sound system that was far superior to the audio at typical theaters in the years prior to the advent of THX . Some IMAX theaters have a hemispheric dome screen geometry , which can give the viewer an even more immersive feel . Over the decades since its introduction , IMAX evolved to include 3D stereoscopic films , introduced in January 1998 , and then began to proliferate with a transition away from analog film into the digital era . Beginning in May 1991 , a visceral dimension of the movie experience was added by having the audience 's seats mounted on a full-motion platform as an amusement park ride in IMAX ride film theaters . With the advent of digital projection , the IMAX brand has also been applied to lower-resolution imaging systems , causing some degree of confusion among the viewing public .",

It lies in two main pieces about a third of a mile ( 600 m ) apart . The bow is still recognisable with many preserved interiors , despite deterioration and damage sustained hitting the sea floor . In contrast , the stern is completely ruined . A debris field around the wreck contains hundreds of thousands of items spilled from the ship as she sank . The bodies of the passengers and crew would have also been distributed across the sea bed , but have been consumed by other organisms . Titanic sank in 1912 , when she collided with an iceberg during her maiden voyage . Numerous expeditions tried using sonar to map the sea bed in the hope of finding it , but were unsuccessful . In 1985 , the wreck was finally located by a joint French-American expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel of IFREMER and Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution . The wreck has been the focus of intense interest and has been visited by numerous expeditions . Controversial salvage operations have recovered thousands of items , which have been conserved and put on public display . Many schemes have been proposed to raise Titanic , including filling the wreck with ping-pong balls , injecting it with 180,000 tons of Vaseline , or using half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to encase it in an iceberg that would float to the surface .",

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects , the film is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic , and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage . Cameron 's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks ; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster . Production began in 1995 , when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck . The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh , which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck . Scale models , computer-generated imagery , and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking . The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox ; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally . It was the most expensive film ever made at the time , with a production budget of $ 200 million . Upon its release on December 19 , 1997 , Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success . Nominated for 14 Academy Awards , it tied All About Eve ( 1950 ) for the most Oscar nominations , and won 11 , including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director , tying Ben-Hur ( 1959 ) for the most Oscars won by a single film . With an initial worldwide gross of over $ 1.84 billion , Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark , and became the highest-grossing film ever at the time , until Cameron 's Avatar surpassed it in 2010 . A 3D version of Titanic , released on April 4 , 2012 , to commemorate the centennial of the sinking , earned it an additional $ 343.6 million worldwide , pushing the film 's worldwide total to $ 2.18 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $ 2 billion worldwide ( after Avatar ) .",

While Frenchmen Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema , American cinema soon came to be a dominant force in the emerging industry . It produces the largest number of films of any single-language national cinema , with more than 700 English-language films released on average every year . While the national cinemas of the United Kingdom ( 299 ) , Canada ( 206 ) , Australia , and New Zealand also produce films in the same language , they are not considered part of the Hollywood system . Hollywood has also been considered a transnational cinema . Hollywood produced multiple language versions of some titles , often in Spanish or French . Contemporary Hollywood off-shores production to Canada , Australia , and New Zealand . Hollywood is considered the oldest film industry where earliest film studios and production companies emerged , it is also the birthplace of various genres of cinema - among them comedy , drama , action , the musical , romance , horror , science fiction , and the war epic - having set an example for other national film industries . In 1878 , Eadweard Muybridge demonstrated the power of photography to capture motion . In 1894 , the world 's first commercial motion-picture exhibition was given in New York City , using Thomas Edison 's kinetoscope .

A subgenre of action films , these films usually feature some degree of build-up , the disaster itself , and sometimes the aftermath , usually from the point of view of specific individual characters or their families or portraying the survival tactics of different people . These films often feature large casts of actors and multiple plot lines , focusing on the characters ' attempts to avert , escape or cope with the disaster and its aftermath . The genre came to particular prominence during the 1970s with the release of high-profile films such as Airport ( 1970 ) , followed in quick succession by The Poseidon Adventure ( 1972 ) , Earthquake ( 1974 ) and The Towering Inferno ( 1974 ) . The casts were generally made up of familiar character actors . Once the disaster begins in the film , the characters are usually confronted with human weaknesses , often falling in love and almost always finding a villain to blame . The films usually feature a persevering hero or heroine ( Charlton Heston , Steve McQueen , etc . ) called upon to lead the struggle against the threat . In many cases , the evil or selfish individuals are the first to succumb to the conflagration .

Inflation , filming techniques and external market forces affect the economics of film production . Costs rose steadily during the silent era with Ben-Hur : A Tale of the Christ ( 1925 ) setting a record that lasted well into the sound era . Television had an impact on rising costs in the 1950s and early 1960s as cinema competed with it for audiences , culminating in 1963 with Cleopatra ; despite being the highest earning film of the year , Cleopatra did not earn back its costs on its original release .

  "/wiki/IMAX_3D": "IMAX is a proprietary system of high-resolution cameras , film formats , film projectors , and theaters known for having very large screens with a tall aspect ratio ( approximately 1.43:1 & 1.90:1 ) and steep stadium seating . Graeme Ferguson , Roman Kroitor , Robert Kerr , and William C. Shaw were the co-founders of what would be named the IMAX Corporation ( founded in September 1967 as Multiscreen Corporation , Limited ) , and they developed the first IMAX cinema projection standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Canada . Unlike conventional film projectors , the film runs horizontally so that the image width can be greater than the width of the film stock . When IMAX was introduced , it was a radical change in the movie-going experience . Viewers were treated to the scene of a gently-curved giant screen more than seven stories tall ( 75 feet ( 23 m ) , with the tallest measuring 117 feet ( 36 m ) ) and steep stadium seating that made for a visually immersive experience . This was enhanced by a sound system that was far superior to the audio at typical theaters in the years prior to the advent of THX . Some IMAX theaters have a hemispheric dome screen geometry , which can give the viewer an even more immersive feel . Over the decades since its introduction , IMAX evolved to include 3D stereoscopic films , introduced in January 1998 , and then began to proliferate with a transition away from analog film into the digital era . Beginning in May 1991 , a visceral dimension of the movie experience was added by having the audience 's seats mounted on a full-motion platform as an amusement park ride in IMAX ride film theaters . With the advent of digital projection , the IMAX brand has also been applied to lower-resolution imaging systems , causing some degree of confusion among the viewing public .",
  "/wiki/Titanic_in_3D": "Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance and disaster film directed , written , co-produced , and co-edited by James Cameron . Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects , the film is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic , and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage . Cameron 's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks ; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster . Production began in 1995 , when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck . The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh , which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck . Scale models , computer-generated imagery , and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking . The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox ; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally . It was the most expensive film ever made at the time , with a production budget of $ 200 million . Upon its release on December 19 , 1997 , Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success . Nominated for 14 Academy Awards , it tied All About Eve ( 1950 ) for the most Oscar nominations , and won 11 , including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director , tying Ben-Hur ( 1959 ) for the most Oscars won by a single film . With an initial worldwide gross of over $ 1.84 billion , Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark , and became the highest-grossing film ever at the time , until Cameron 's Avatar surpassed it in 2010 . A 3D version of Titanic , released on April 4 , 2012 , to commemorate the centennial of the sinking , earned it an additional $ 343.6 million worldwide , pushing the film 's worldwide total to $ 2.18 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $ 2 billion worldwide ( after Avatar ) .",

  "/wiki/3-D_film": "A three-dimensional stereoscopic film ( also known as three-dimensional film , 3D film or S3D film ) is a motion picture that enhances the illusion of depth perception , hence adding a third dimension . The most common approach to the production of 3D films is derived from stereoscopic photography . In this approach , a regular motion picture camera system is used to record the images as seen from two perspectives ( or computer-generated imagery generates the two perspectives in post-production ) , and special projection hardware or eyewear is used to limit the visibility of each image to the viewer 's left or right eye only . 3D films are not limited to theatrical releases ; television broadcasts and direct-to-video films have also incorporated similar methods , especially since the advent of 3D television and Blu-ray 3D . 3D films have existed in some form since 1915 , but had been largely relegated to a niche in the motion picture industry because of the costly hardware and processes required to produce and display a 3D film , and the lack of a standardized format for all segments of the entertainment business . Nonetheless , 3D films were prominently featured in the 1950s in American cinema , and later experienced a worldwide resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s driven by IMAX high-end theaters and Disney-themed venues . 3D films became increasingly successful throughout the 2000s , peaking with the success of 3D presentations of Avatar in December 2009 , after which 3D films again decreased in popularity .

  "/wiki/Deep-sea_exploration": "Deep-sea exploration is the investigation of physical , chemical , and biological conditions on the sea bed , for scientific or commercial purposes . Deep-sea exploration is considered a relatively recent human activity compared to the other areas of geophysical research , as the depths of the sea have been investigated only during comparatively recent years . The ocean depths still remain a largely unexplored part of the planet , and form a relatively undiscovered domain . In general , modern scientific Deep-sea exploration can be said to have begun when French scientist Pierre Simon de Laplace investigated the average depth of the Atlantic ocean by observing tidal motions registered on Brazilian and African coasts . He calculated the depth to be 3,962 metres ( 12,999 ft ) , a value later proven quite accurate by soundings measurement . Later on , with increasing demand for submarine cables installment , accurate soundings was required and the first investigations of the sea bottom were undertaken . The first deep-sea life forms were discovered in 1864 when Norwegian researchers obtained a sample of a stalked crinoid at a depth of 3,109 m ( 10,200 ft ) . The British Government sent out the Challenger expedition ( a ship called HMS Challenger ) in 1872 which discovered 715 new genera and 4,417 new species of marine organisms over the space of four years . The first instrument used for deep-sea investigation was the sounding weight , used by British explorer Sir James Clark Ross . With this instrument , he reached a depth of 3,700 m ( 12,139 ft ) in 1840 . The Challenger expedition used similar instruments called Baillie sounding machines to extract samples from the sea bed . In 1960 , Jacques Piccard and United States Navy Lieutenant Donald Walsh descended in the bathyscaphe Trieste into the Mariana Trench , the deepest part of the world 's oceans , to make the deepest dive in history : 10,915 m ( 35,810 ft ) .",

  "/wiki/Queen_Victoria": "Victoria ( Alexandrina Victoria ; 24 May 1819 - 22 January 1901 ) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death . On 1 May 1876 , she adopted the additional title of Empress of India . Known as the Victorian era , her reign of 63 years and seven months was longer than that of any of her predecessors . It was a period of industrial , cultural , political , scientific , and military change within the United Kingdom , and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire . Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn ( the fourth son of King George III ) , and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld . After both the Duke and his father died in 1820 , she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller , John Conroy . She inherited the throne aged 18 after her father 's three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue . The United Kingdom was an established constitutional monarchy in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power . Privately , she attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments ; publicly , she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality . Victoria married her cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840 . Their children married into royal and noble families across the continent , earning Victoria the sobriquet the grandmother of Europe and spreading haemophilia in European royalty . After Albert 's death in 1861 , Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances ."
