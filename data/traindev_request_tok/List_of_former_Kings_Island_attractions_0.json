The ride was permanently closed after just three seasons in 1983 and removed from the park the following year .",
  "/wiki/Arrow_Dynamics": "Arrow Dynamics was an American manufacturing and engineering company that specialized in designing and building amusement park rides , especially roller coasters . Based in Clearfield , Utah , the company was the successor to Arrow Development ( 1946-1981 ) and Arrow Huss ( 1981-1986 ) , which were responsible for several influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries . Among the most significant was tubular steel track , which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on wooden roller coasters . The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland , built in 1959 , was Arrow 's first roller coaster project . In 1975 , Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track Corkscrew , at Knott 's Berry Farm that sent riders through a series of corkscrews . Arrow created several other firsts over the years , introducing the first suspended roller coaster in almost a century , The Bat , in 1981 , and the world 's first hypercoaster , Magnum XL-200 , which opened in 1989 . They built the first 4th Dimension roller coaster , X2 , which was designed by Alan Schilke in 2002 . Arrow Development 's ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s . Arrow Dynamics would eventually survive two bankruptcies and spin off a sister company , Fabriweld , primarily to build track , by 1988 . Arrow Dynamics eventually closed on December 3 , 2001 . S & S Worldwide purchased part of Arrow 's remaining assets on October 28 , 2002 , and the remainder of the company was dissolved . In 2012 , Sansei Yusoki Co. of Osaka , Japan , acquired a 77.3% interest in S & S - Arrow .",

  "/wiki/Werner_Stengel": "Werner Stengel ( born 22 August 1936 in Bochum ) is a German roller coaster designer and engineer . Stengel is the founder of Stengel Engineering , also known as Ingenieurb\u00fcro Stengel GmbH ( or Ingenieurbuero Stengel GmbH ) . Stengel first worked on amusement park rides in collaboration with Anton Schwarzkopf in 1963 . He established his own company , Stengel Engineering , in 1965 . His collaboration with Schwarzkopf was responsible for many innovations in roller coaster design , including in 1976 the first modern vertical looping coaster , Revolution , at Six Flags Magic Mountain . ( Arrow Dynamics had debuted the first modern corkscrew loop a year earlier at Knott 's Berry Farm ) . His clothoid loop is now standard on many roller coasters , as it produces less intense forces on the human body than a circular vertical loop . In 1976 Stengel and Schwarzkopf established the first horizontal launch Shuttle Loop . He is notable for being a pioneer in heartlining , the principle of having the track twist and rotate around the rider 's heart line , rather than the track rotating around its own center . Since Schwarzkopf 's retirement , Stengel has worked on most of the world 's record-breaking roller coasters , including Son of Beast , Millennium Force , Superman The Ride , Top Thrill Dragster , Kingda Ka , Dollywood 's Mystery Mine , El Toro , Maverick and Olympia Looping , the world 's largest portable roller coaster , among many others . Seventy-two percent of the attractions on the 2004 Amusement Today Golden Ticket Awards list of the world 's top fifty steel roller coasters were designed by Stengel Engineering . Stengel received an honorary doctorate from Gothenburg University in 2005 for inexhaustible creativity in linking physics and design to the experience of the body in roller coasters and other rides , among the most highly regarded of which is Lisebergbanan at Liseberg park in Gothenburg , Sweden .",

  "/wiki/Wooden_roller_coaster": "A wooden roller coaster is most often classified as a roller coaster with running rails made of flattened steel strips mounted on laminated wooden track . Occasionally , the support structure may be made out of a steel lattice or truss , but the ride remains classified as a wooden roller coaster due to the track design . The type of wood typically used in the construction of wooden coasters is Southern Yellow Pine , usually grown in the US and the rest of North America . Because of the limits of wood , wooden roller coasters , in general , do not have inversions ( when the coaster goes upside down ) , steep drops , or extremely banked turns ( overbanked turns ) . However , there are exceptions , such as the original loop on Son of Beast at Kings Island ; a corkscrew and 90-degree banked turn at Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells , Wisconsin ; a steel structure at The Voyage at Holiday World ; and banked turns at Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City .",
