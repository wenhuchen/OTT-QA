In French , L'Anse translates as the cove or the bay , a reference to its location in on the southern portion of L'Anse Bay , a portion of the larger Keweenaw Bay , at the base of the Keweenaw Peninsula . The modern-day village then grew up around this French trading post . Following treaties with the United States in the 19th century , the Ojibwa/Chippewa ceded extensive amounts of land in Michigan .
