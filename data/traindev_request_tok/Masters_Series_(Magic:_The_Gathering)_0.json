The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC . The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for a millennium and more , from 697 to 1797 . It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance , and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto , as well as an important center of commerce - especially silk , grain , and spice , and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th . The city-state of Venice is considered to have been the first real international financial center , emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest prominence in the 14th century . This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history . After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna , the Republic was annexed by the Austrian Empire , until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866 , following a referendum held as a result of the Third Italian War of Independence . Venice has been known as La Dominante , La Serenissima , Queen of the Adriatic , City of Water , City of Masks , City of Bridges , The Floating City , and City of Canals .",
