  "/wiki/The_Ashes": "The Ashes is a Test cricket series played between England and Australia . The Ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the Test series . If the test series is drawn , the team that currently holds the Ashes retains the trophy . The term originated in a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper , The Sporting Times , immediately after Australia 's 1882 victory at The Oval , its first Test win on English soil . The obituary stated that English cricket had died , and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia . The mythical ashes immediately became associated with the 1882-83 series played in Australia , before which the English captain Ivo Bligh had vowed to regain those ashes . The English media therefore dubbed the tour the quest to regain the Ashes . After England had won two of the three Tests on the tour , a small urn was presented to Bligh by a group of Melbourne women including Florence Morphy , whom Bligh married within a year . The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of a wooden bail , and were humorously described as the ashes of Australian cricket . It is not clear whether that tiny silver urn is the same as the small terracotta urn given to the MCC by Bligh 's widow after his death in 1927 . The urn has never been the official trophy of the Ashes series , having been a personal gift to Bligh . However , replicas of the urn are often held aloft by victorious teams as a symbol of their victory in an Ashes series .",

  "/wiki/History_of_Test_cricket_from_1877_to_1883": "Test matches in the period 1877 to 1883 were organised somewhat differently from international cricket matches today . All were between Australian and English sides , the teams were rarely representative , and the lengthy boat trip required was one that many cricketers ( especially amateurs ) were unable or unwilling to undertake . As such , the home teams enjoyed a great advantage . Thirteen Test Matches were played during the period between Australian and English sides . Most were not styled as representative England v. Australia contests , however : this description was only applied later by cricket statisticians . The same is true of their designation as Test matches , which did not enter into the vernacular until 1885 . [ citation needed ] Eleven of the thirteen matches played to 1883 were in Australia , where the colonials made the most of their home advantage , winning seven while England won four , and two matches were drawn . By 1883 , the tradition of England-Australia tours was well established , that year having concluded the first Ashes series . When England lost at home for the first time in 1882 , The Sporting Times lamented the death of cricket in the mother country and declared that the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia . England captain Ivo Bligh promised that on the tour to Australia in 1882-83 he would regain the ashes and the term began to be established . During that tour a small terracotta urn was presented to Bligh by a group of Melbourne women . The urn is commonly , but erroneously , believed to be the trophy of the Ashes series , but it has never been formally adopted as such and Bligh always considered it to be a personal gift .",

South Africa is a full member of the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) with Test , One-Day International ( ODI ) and Twenty20 International ( T20I ) status . South Africa entered first-class and international cricket at the same time when they hosted an England cricket team in the 1888-89 season . At first , the team was no match for Australia or England but , having gained in experience and expertise , they were able to field a competitive team in the first decade of the 20th century . The team regularly played against Australia , England and New Zealand through to the 1960s , by which time there was considerable opposition to the country 's apartheid policy and an international ban was imposed by the ICC , commensurate with actions taken by other global sporting bodies . When the ban was imposed , South Africa had developed to a point where its team including Eddie Barlow , Graeme Pollock and Mike Procter was arguably the best in the world and had just outplayed Australia . The ban remained in place until 1991 and South Africa could then play against India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka and the West Indies for the first time . The team since reinstatement has mostly been strong and has at times held number one positions in international rankings ( had best ranking of No.1 in all three formats ) but has lacked success in ICC organised tournaments . Outstanding players since reinstatement have included Allan Donald , Makhaya Ntini , Shaun Pollock , Jacques Kallis , Graeme Smith , Kagiso Rabada , AB de Villiers , Dale Steyn , Herschelle Gibbs , Faf du Plessis , Morne Morkel , Imran Tahir and Hashim Amla .",
