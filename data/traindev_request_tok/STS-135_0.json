It had a different melody , and was included in the band 's third EP , The Blue Room . The track was reproduced by Coldplay and British producer Ken Nelson for the band 's debut album , Parachutes . Following their successful releases in 2000 , Coldplay and their record label Parlophone thought there was enough exposure of the album in the United Kingdom . Thus , the decision of releasing a fourth single would be for regions that had not been overdosed by the hit singles Yellow and Trouble . They settled on Do n't Panic , which at the time was an audience favourite . The single was released in some European regions , and the United Kingdom only received a promo edition . The critical reception of the song was generally positive .",

  "/wiki/Fanfare_for_the_Common_Man": "Fanfare for the Common Man is a musical work by the American composer Aaron Copland . It was written in 1942 for the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra under conductor Eugene Goossens and was inspired in part by a speech made earlier that year by United States Vice President Henry A. Wallace , in which Wallace proclaimed the dawning of the Century of the Common Man . Several alternative versions have been made and fragments of the work have appeared in many subsequent US and British cultural productions , such as in the musical scores of movies .",
  "/wiki/Aaron_Copland": "Aaron Copland ( /\u02c8ko\u028apl\u0259nd/ , KOHP-l\u0259nd ; November 14 , 1900 - December 2 , 1990 ) was an American composer , composition teacher , writer , and later a conductor of his own and other American music . Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as the Dean of American Composers . The open , slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music , evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit . He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as populist and which the composer labeled his vernacular style . Works in this vein include the ballets Appalachian Spring , Billy the Kid and Rodeo , his Fanfare for the Common Man and Third Symphony . In addition to his ballets and orchestral works , he produced music in many other genres , including chamber music , vocal works , opera and film scores . After some initial studies with composer Rubin Goldmark , Copland traveled to Paris , where he first studied with Isidor Philipp and Paul Vidal , then with noted pedagogue Nadia Boulanger . He studied three years with Boulanger , whose eclectic approach to music inspired his own broad taste . Determined upon his return to the U.S. to make his way as a full-time composer , Copland gave lecture-recitals , wrote works on commission and did some teaching and writing . He found composing orchestral music in the modernist style he had adapted abroad a financially contradictory approach , particularly in light of the Great Depression . He shifted in the mid-1930s to a more accessible musical style which mirrored the German idea of Gebrauchsmusik ( music for use ) , music that could serve utilitarian and artistic purposes . During the Depression years , he traveled extensively to Europe , Africa , and Mexico , formed an important friendship with Mexican composer Carlos Ch\u00e1vez and began composing his signature works .",
  "/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center": "The John F. Kennedy Space Center ( KSC , originally known as the NASA Launch Operations Center ) , located in Merritt Island , Florida , is one of ten National Aeronautics and Space Administration field centers . Since December 1968 , KSC has been NASA 's primary launch center of human spaceflight . Launch operations for the Apollo , Skylab and Space Shuttle programs were carried out from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 and managed by KSC . Located on the east coast of Florida , KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ( CCAFS ) . The management of the two entities work very closely together , share resources , and even own facilities on each other 's property . Though the first Apollo flights and all Project Mercury and Project Gemini flights took off from CCAFS , the launches were managed by KSC and its previous organization , the Launch Operations Directorate . Starting with the fourth Gemini mission , the NASA launch control center in Florida ( Mercury Control Center , later the Launch Control Center ) began handing off control of the vehicle to the Mission Control Center in Houston , shortly after liftoff ; in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission . Additionally , the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions and researches food production and In-Situ Resource Utilization for off-Earth exploration . Since 2010 , the center has worked to become a multi-user spaceport through industry partnerships , even adding a new launch pad ( LC-39C ) in 2015 . There are about 700 facilities and buildings grouped across the center 's 144,000 acres ( 580 km2 ) . Among the unique facilities at KSC are the 525-foot ( 160 m ) tall Vehicle Assembly Building for stacking NASA 's largest rockets , the Launch Control Center , which conducts space launches at KSC , the Operations and Checkout Building , which houses the astronauts dormitories and suit-up area , a Space Station factory , and a 3-mile ( 4.8 km ) long Shuttle Landing Facility . There is also a Visitor Complex open to the public on site .",
