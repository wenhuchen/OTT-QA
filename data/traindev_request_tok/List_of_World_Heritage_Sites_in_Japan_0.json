  "/wiki/Arhat_(Buddhism)": "In Buddhism , an arhat ( Sanskrit ) or arahant ( Pali ) is one who has gained insight into the true nature of existence and has achieved nirvana . Mahayana Buddhist traditions have used the term for people far advanced along the path of Enlightenment , but who may not have reached full Buddhahood . The understanding of the concept has changed over the centuries , and varies between different schools of Buddhism and different regions . A range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the early Buddhist schools . The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da , K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya , Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika , Ekavy\u0101vah\u0101rika , Lokottarav\u0101da , Bahu\u015brut\u012bya , Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101da , and Caitika schools all regarded arhats as imperfect in their attainments compared to buddhas . Mahayana Buddhist teachings urge followers to take up the path of a bodhisattva , and to not fall back to the level of arhats and \u015br\u0101vakas . The arhats , or at least the senior arhats , came to be widely regarded by Theravada buddhists as moving beyond the state of personal freedom to join the Bodhisattva enterprise in their own way . Mahayana Buddhism regarded a group of Eighteen Arhats ( with names and personalities ) as awaiting the return of the Buddha as Maitreya , while other groupings of 6 , 8 , 16 , 100 , and 500 also appear in tradition and Buddhist art , especially in East Asia called luohan or lohan . They may be seen as the Buddhist equivalents of the Christian saint , apostles or early disciples and leaders of the faith .",
