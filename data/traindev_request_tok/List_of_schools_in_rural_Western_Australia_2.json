  "/wiki/Albany,_Western_Australia": "Albany /\u02c8\u00e6lb\u0259ni/ is a port city in the Great Southern region in the Australian state of Western Australia , 418 km southeast of Perth , the state capital . Albany is the oldest colonial settlement in Western Australia , predating Perth and Fremantle by over two years . The city centre is at the northern edge of Princess Royal Harbour , which is a part of King George Sound . The central business district is bounded by Mount Clarence to the east and Mount Melville to the west . The city is in the local government area of the City of Albany . The Albany settlement was founded on 26 December 1826 , as a military outpost of New South Wales as part of a plan to forestall French ambitions in the region . To that end , on 21 January 1827 , the commander of the outpost , Major Edmund Lockyer , formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown . The settlement was initially named Frederick Town in honour of Prince Frederick , Duke of York and Albany . In 1831 , the settlement was transferred to the control of the Swan River Colony and renamed Albany by Lieutenant-Governor James Stirling . During the last decade of the 19th century the town served as a gateway to the Eastern Goldfields . For many years , it was the colony 's only deep-water port , having a place of eminence on shipping services between Britain and its Australian colonies . The opening of the Fremantle Inner Harbour in 1897 , however , saw its importance as a port decline , after which the town 's industries turned primarily to agriculture , timber and later , whaling .",
