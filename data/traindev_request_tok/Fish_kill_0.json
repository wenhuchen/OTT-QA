  "/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico": "The Gulf of Mexico ( Spanish : Golfo de M\u00e9xico ) is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean , largely surrounded by the North American continent . It is bounded on the northeast , north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States , on the southwest and south by Mexico , and on the southeast by Cuba . The US states of Texas , Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida border the Gulf on the north , which are often referred to as the Third Coast , in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts . The Gulf of Mexico formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of plate tectonics . The Gulf of Mexico basin is roughly oval and is approximately 810 nautical miles ( 1,500 km ; 930 mi ) wide and floored by sedimentary rocks and recent sediments . It is connected to part of the Atlantic Ocean through the Florida Straits between the U.S. and Cuba , and with the Caribbean Sea ( with which it forms the American Mediterranean Sea ) via the Yucat\u00e1n Channel between Mexico and Cuba . With the narrow connection to the Atlantic , the Gulf experiences very small tidal ranges . The size of the Gulf basin is approximately 1.6 million km2 ( 615,000 sq mi ) . Almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters . The basin contains a volume of roughly 2,500 quadrillion liters ( 550 quadrillion Imperial gallons , 660 quadrillion US gallons , 2.5 million km3 or 600,000 cu mi ) . The Gulf of Mexico is one of the most important offshore petroleum production regions in the world , comprising one-sixth of the United States ' total production .",

  "/wiki/Red_tide": "Red tide is a common name for algal blooms , which are large concentrations of aquatic microorganisms , such as protozoans and unicellular algae ( e.g . dinoflagellates and diatoms ) . [ citation needed ] The upwelling of nutrients from the sea floor , often following massive storms , provides for the algae and triggers bloom events . Harmful algal blooms can occur worldwide , and natural cycles can vary regionally . The growth and persistence of an algal bloom depends on wind direction and strength , temperature , nutrients , and salinity . Red tide species can be found in oceans , bays , and estuaries , but they can not thrive in freshwater environments . Certain species of phytoplankton and dinoflagellates like 'Gonyaulax ' found in red tides contain photosynthetic pigments that vary in color from brown to red . These organisms undergo such rapid multiplication that they make the sea appear red.When the algae are present in high concentrations , the water may appear to be discolored or murky . The most conspicuous effects of red tides are the associated wildlife mortalities and harmful human exposure . The production of natural toxins such as brevetoxins and ichthyotoxins are harmful to marine life . Effects of red tides can worsen locally due to wind driven Langmuir circulation and their biological effects .",

Other fish in the same family include trout , char , grayling and whitefish . Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic ( genus Salmo ) and Pacific Ocean ( genus Oncorhynchus ) . Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America . Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world . Typically , salmon are anadromous : they hatch in fresh water , migrate to the ocean , then return to fresh water to reproduce . However , populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives . Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn . Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true . A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems ; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon . Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory . Salmon date back to the Neogene .",

Trout are closely related to salmon and char ( or charr ) : species termed salmon and char occur in the same genera as do fish called trout ( Oncorhynchus - Pacific salmon and trout , Salmo - Atlantic salmon and various trout , Salvelinus - char and trout ) . Lake trout and most other trout live in freshwater lakes and rivers exclusively , while there are others , such as the steelhead , a form of the coastal rainbow trout , that can spend two or three years at sea before returning to fresh water to spawn ( a habit more typical of salmon ) . Arctic char and brook trout are part of the char family . Trout are an important food source for humans and wildlife , including brown bears , birds of prey such as eagles , and other animals . They are classified as oily fish .",

Its main tributaries are Nant Cwm-du and Nant Cedfyw which enter on its left bank and Nant Crynwydd , Nant Sychbant and Nant y Gadlys on its right bank . The Llynfi has endured a long period of industrialisation and coal mining especially around Maesteg . There was an ironworks and brick works at Tondu . Industrialisation and poor provision of sewerage led to severe water pollution of the river . In the second half of the 20th century , whilst the impact of coal mining diminished , new industries such as cosmetics and toiletries , paper making and sewage disposal continued to maintain the Llynfi in an almost abiotic condition . Strong enforcement action against a number of industries helped to ensure a steady improvement in quality into the 21st century .",

A report by the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service found that the kill resulted from water diversions to Klamath Basin by farmers and ranchers during a drought year . The report found that the atypical low flow in the river along with high fish return numbers and high water temperatures allowed for a gill rot disease to kill at least 33,000 salmon in September 2002 , before they could reproduce . The die-off was downstream of the Trinity inflow , and the salmon of the Trinity were impacted to a greater degree than the Klamath as the Trinity run was at its peak . The report does mention that the official fish die-off estimate of 34,056 is probably quite low and could be only half of the actual loss . Klamath River flows as measured at the river gauge in Keno show a low flow of 800 cubic feet per second ( 22.7 m3/s ) in September 1908 ( before irrigation began ) .

  "/wiki/Volcanic_activity": "A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object , such as Earth , that allows hot lava , volcanic ash , and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface . Earth 's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major , rigid tectonic plates that float on a hotter , softer layer in its mantle . Therefore , on Earth , volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging , and most are found underwater . For example , a mid-oceanic ridge , such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates . Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust 's plates , e.g. , in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande Rift in North America . This type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of plate hypothesis volcanism . Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes . These so-called hotspots , for example Hawaii , are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core-mantle boundary , 3,000 km deep in the Earth . Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another .",
  "/wiki/Fish_farms": "Fish farming or pisciculture involves raising fish commercially in tanks or enclosures such as fish ponds , usually for food .

  "/wiki/Hypothermia": "Hypothermia is defined as a body core temperature below 35.0 \u00b0C ( 95.0 \u00b0F ) in humans . Symptoms depend on the temperature . In mild hypothermia there is shivering and mental confusion . In moderate hypothermia shivering stops and confusion increases . In severe hypothermia , there may be paradoxical undressing , in which a person removes their clothing , as well as an increased risk of the heart stopping . Hypothermia has two main types of causes . It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold . It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss . Commonly this includes alcohol intoxication but may also include low blood sugar , anorexia , and advanced age . Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of 36.5-37.5 \u00b0C ( 97.7-99.5 \u00b0F ) through thermoregulation . Efforts to increase body temperature involve shivering , increased voluntary activity , and putting on warmer clothing . Hypothermia may be diagnosed based on either a person 's symptoms in the presence of risk factors or by measuring a person 's core temperature .",
  "/wiki/Ting_River": "The Ting River ( Chinese : \u6c40\u6c5f ; pinyin : T\u00edng Ji\u0101ng ) flows 300 kilometres ( 190 mi ) from Ninghua County in western Fujian south to the port and Special Economic Zone of Shantou , Guangdong . It is a main tributary of the Han River and is also referred to Hakka Mother River ( Chinese : \u5ba2\u5bb6\u6bcd\u4eb2\u6cb3 ) . The former prefecture of Tingzhou fu or T'ingchow-fu ( \u6c40\u5dde\u5e9c ) was administered from a centre on the upper river , now the town of Tingzhou in Changting County ; all these places are named for the river . As most inhabitants of Tingzhou-fu/Changting are Hakka , and as ( Hakka-speaking ) Meizhou ( \u6885\u5dde ) is next downstream , the Tingjiang is considered by some to be the mother river of all the Hakkas . The Tingjiang is unique among Fujianese rivers in that its lower watershed and debouchment are outside the province . The traffic in Tingzhou-fu/Changting then ( before road and rail came very recently ) was always primarily with eastern areas of Guangdong , namely Meizhou and , further down , the Min-Nan-speaking Chao-Shan area -- Chaozhou ( \u6f6e\u5dde ) and Shantou ( \u6c55\u5934 ) .",
  "/wiki/Fujian": "F\u00faji\u00e0n ( \u798f\u5efa ; alternately romanized as Fukien or Hokkien Province ) is a province on the southeast coast of mainland China . Fujian is bordered by Zhejiang to the north , Jiangxi to the west , Guangdong to the south , and the Taiwan Strait to the east . Its capital is Fuzhou , while its largest city by population is Xiamen , both located near the coast of the Taiwan Strait in the east of the province . The name Fujian came from the combination of Fuzhou and Jianzhou ( present Nanping ) , a city in Fujian , during the Tang dynasty . While its population is chiefly of ethnic Chinese origin , it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces in China . Historically the dialects of the language group Min Chinese were most commonly spoken within the province , including the Hokkien dialects of southeastern Fujian . This is reflected in the abbreviation of the province 's name ( \u95a9 ) . Hakka Chinese is also spoken , by the Hakka people in Fujian . Min dialects and Hakka Chinese are unintelligible with Mandarin Chinese . Due to emigration , a sizable amount of the ethnic Chinese populations of Taiwan , Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia and Philippines speak Southern Min ( or Hokkien ) . As a result of the Chinese Civil War , Historical Fujian is now divided between the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) and the Republic of China ( ROC , Taiwan ) , and both territories are named the Fujian province in their respective administration divisions . The majority of the territory of historical Fujian ( the mainland territory and a few islands ) currently make up the Fujian province of the PRC .",

  "/wiki/Mississippi_River": "The Mississippi River is the second-longest river and chief river of the second-largest drainage system on the North American continent , second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system . From its traditional source of Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota , it flows generally south for 2,320 miles ( 3,730 km ) to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico . With its many tributaries , the Mississippi 's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains . The main stem is entirely within the United States ; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi ( 2,980,000 km2 ) , of which only about one percent is in Canada . The Mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest river and fifteenth-largest river by discharge in the world . The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota , Wisconsin , Iowa , Illinois , Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana . Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years . Most were hunter-gatherers , but some , such as the Mound Builders , formed prolific agricultural societies . The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers , then settlers , ventured into the basin in increasing numbers . The river served first as a barrier , forming borders for New Spain , New France , and the early United States , and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link . In the 19th century , during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny , the Mississippi and several western tributaries , most notably the Missouri , formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States . Formed from thick layers of the river 's silt deposits , the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile regions of the United States ; steamboats were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods .",

The river 's source basin lies in the western United States in Colorado , specifically the Arkansas River Valley , where the headwaters derive from the snowpack in the Sawatch and Mosquito mountain ranges . It then flows east into the Midwest via Kansas , and finally into the South through Oklahoma and Arkansas . At 1,469 miles ( 2,364 km ) , it is the sixth-longest river in the United States , the second-longest tributary in the Mississippi-Missouri system , and the 45th longest river in the world . Its origin is in the Rocky Mountains in Lake County , Colorado , near Leadville . In 1859 , placer gold discovered in the Leadville area brought thousands seeking to strike it rich , but the easily recovered placer gold was quickly exhausted . The Arkansas River 's mouth is at Napoleon , Arkansas , and its drainage basin covers nearly 170,000 square miles ( 440,000 km2 ) . Its volume is much smaller than the Missouri and Ohio Rivers , with a mean discharge of about 40,000 cubic feet per second ( 1,100 m3/s ) .

  "/wiki/Freshwater_drum": "The freshwater drum , Aplodinotus grunniens , is a fish endemic to North and Central America . It is the only species in the genus Aplodinotus , and is a member of the family Sciaenidae . It is the only North American member of the group that inhabits freshwater for its entire life . Its generic name , Aplodinotus , comes from Greek meaning single back , and the specific epithet , grunniens , comes from a Latin word meaning grunting . It is given to it because of the grunting noise that mature males make . This noise comes from a special set of muscles within the body cavity that vibrate against the swim bladder . The purpose of the grunting is unknown , but due to it being present in only mature males , it is assumed to be linked to spawning . The drum typically weighs 5-15 lb ( 2.3-6.8 kg ) . The world record was caught on Nickajack Lake in Tennessee , and weighed in at 54 lb 8 oz ( 24.7 kg ) . The freshwater drum is gray or silvery in turbid waters and more bronze or brown colored in clearer waters . It is a deep bodied fish with a divided dorsal fin consisting of 10 spines and 29-32 rays .

They are found in both temperate and tropical seas , mostly living along the coast or offshore in the oceanic environment . Mackerel species typically have vertical stripes on their backs and deeply forked tails . Many are restricted in their distribution ranges and live in separate populations or fish stocks based on geography . Some stocks migrate in large schools along the coast to suitable spawning grounds , where they spawn in fairly shallow waters . After spawning they return the way they came in smaller schools to suitable feeding grounds , often near an area of upwelling . From there they may move offshore into deeper waters and spend the winter in relative inactivity . Other stocks migrate across oceans . Smaller mackerel are forage fish for larger predators , including larger mackerel and Atlantic cod . Flocks of seabirds , whales , dolphins , sharks , and schools of larger fish such as tuna and marlin follow mackerel schools and attack them in sophisticated and cooperative ways . Mackerel flesh is high in omega-3 oils and is intensively harvested by humans . In 2009 , over 5 million tons were landed by commercial fishermen .",

The terms sardine and pilchard are not precise , and what is meant depends on the region . The United Kingdom 's Sea Fish Industry Authority , for example , classifies sardines as young pilchards . One criterion suggests fish shorter in length than 15 cm ( 6 in ) are sardines , and larger fish are pilchards .
