  "/wiki/Testosterone": "Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid . In male humans , testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate , as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass , and the growth of body hair . In addition , testosterone is involved in health and well-being , and the prevention of osteoporosis . Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss . Testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a keto and hydroxyl groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively . It is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites . It exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor . In humans and most other vertebrates , testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and , to a lesser extent , the ovaries of females . On average , in adult males , levels of testosterone are about 7 to 8 times as great as in adult females . As the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced , the daily production is about 20 times greater in men . Females are also more sensitive to the hormone . In addition to its role as a natural hormone , testosterone is used as a medication in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men , transgender hormone therapy for transgender men , and breast cancer in women .",

  "/wiki/Anabolic_steroids": "Anabolic steroids , also known more properly as anabolic-androgenic steroids ( AAS ) , are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone . They are anabolic and increase protein within cells , especially in skeletal muscles , and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects , including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of facial and body hair . The word anabolic , referring to anabolism , comes from the Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae anabole , that which is thrown up , mound . Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists , the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone . AAS were synthesized in the 1930s , and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite , induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions , such as cancer and AIDS . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS , in the presence of adequate diet , can contribute to increases in body weight , often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals . Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS . These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels ( increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein ) , acne , high blood pressure , liver damage ( mainly with most oral AAS ) , and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart . These risks are further increased when , as they often do , athletes take steroids alongside other drugs , causing significantly more damage to their bodies . The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes . Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS . In women and children , AAS can cause irreversible masculinization .",

Like most pharmacologically-active secondary metabolites of plants , THC is a lipid found in cannabis , assumed to be involved in the plant 's self-defense , putatively against insect predation , ultraviolet light , and environmental stress . THC , along with its double bond isomers and their stereoisomers , is one of only three cannabinoids scheduled by the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances ( the other two are dimethylheptylpyran and parahexyl ) . It was listed under Schedule I in 1971 , but reclassified to Schedule II in 1991 following a recommendation from the WHO . Based on subsequent studies , the WHO has recommended the reclassification to the less-stringent Schedule III . Cannabis as a plant is scheduled by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs ( Schedule I and IV ) . It is specifically still listed under Schedule I by US federal law under the Controlled Substances Act for having no accepted medical use and lack of accepted safety . However , dronabinol is a synthetic form of THC approved by the FDA as an appetite stimulant for people with AIDS and antiemetic for people receiving chemotherapy .

One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) .

Low levels of EPO ( around 10 mU/mL ) are constantly secreted sufficient to compensate for normal red blood cell turnover . Common causes of cellular hypoxia resulting in elevated levels of EPO ( up to 10 000 mU/mL ) include any anemia , and hypoxemia due to chronic lung disease . Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney in close association with the peritubular capillary and proximal convoluted tubule . It is also produced in perisinusoidal cells in the liver . Liver production predominates in the fetal and perinatal period ; renal production predominates in adulthood . It is homologous with thrombopoietin . Exogenous erythropoietin , recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhEPO ) , is produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture and are collectively called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESA ) : two examples are epoetin alfa and epoetin beta . ESAs are used in the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease , anemia in myelodysplasia , and in anemia from cancer chemotherapy . Risks of therapy include death , myocardial infarction , stroke , venous thromboembolism , and tumor recurrence . Risk increases when EPO treatment raises hemoglobin levels over 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL : this is to be avoided . rhEPO has been used illicitly as a performance-enhancing drug .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

It is also used non-medically for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes . It is often taken by mouth . Side effects of metandienone include symptoms of masculinization like acne , increased hair growth , voice changes , and increased sexual desire , estrogenic effects like fluid retention and breast enlargement , and liver damage . The drug is an agonist of the androgen receptor ( AR ) , the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) , and has strong anabolic effects and moderate androgenic effects . It also has moderate estrogenic effects . Metandienone was originally developed in 1955 by CIBA and marketed in Germany and the United States . As the CIBA product Dianabol , metandienone quickly became the first widely used AAS among professional and amateur athletes , and remains the most common orally active AAS for non-medical use . It is currently a controlled substance in the United States and United Kingdom and remains popular among bodybuilders . Metandienone is readily available without a prescription in certain countries such as Mexico , and is also manufactured in some Asian countries .",

It is on the list of substances prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency since it is a detectable metabolite of nandrolone , an anabolic-androgenic steroid ( AAS ) . Consumption of androstendione products contaminated with traces of bolandione may also result in testing positive for nandrolone . Traces of 19-norandrosterone may be naturally present in human urine . An experiment conducted on athletes showed that after a prolonged intense effort , the 19-norandrosterone concentration can be increased by a factor varying between 2 and 4 , but another study failed to replicate the result . Concentration also increases in the urine of female athletes during menstruation . The consumption of edible parts of a non-castrated pig , containing 19-nortestosterone , has been shown to result in the excretion of 19-norandrosterone in the following hours , so athletes should prudently avoid meals composed of pig offal in the hours preceding doping tests .

  "/wiki/Continuous_erythropoietin_receptor_activator": "Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator ( CERA ) is the generic term for drugs in a new class of third-generation erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) . In the media , these agents are commonly referred to as 'EPO ' , short for erythropoietin . CERAs have an extended half-life and a mechanism of action that promotes increased stimulation of erythropoietin receptors compared with other ESAs . Under the trade name Mircera , Roche Pharmaceuticals received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in January 2008 to market a continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator ( methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta ) for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease , including in those undergoing dialysis . . [ citation needed ] This issue appears to have been resolved since Fresenius Medical dialysis clinics in the US are now administering this drug . [ citation needed ] ) Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta had been approved by the European Commission in August 2007 , and was made available in Europe at the start of 2008 . In terms of its structure , Mircera is similar to the previous synthetic EPO drugs , except that it is connected to a chemical called polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , which makes it last longer in the body . According to Roche , the product has the longest half-life of all FDA-approved erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) : up to 6 times longer than darbepoetin alfa and up to 20 times longer than epoetin . CERAs thus promise both lower dosing - significant owing to the high inherent cost of manufacturing recombinant protein drugs - and less frequent injections for patients . ESAs are administered via subcutaneous injections , often in doctor 's offices for patients who lack the skill or dexterity to inject themselves , so the once- or twice-monthly dosing regimen for CERAs promises fewer costly , inconvenient office visits for patients requiring constant hemoglobin level maintenance for chronic kidney disease . In clinical trials , CERA dosed every 3 to 4 weeks demonstrated efficacy similar to that of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa in maintaining hemoglobin concentrations within the target hemoglobin range .",

  "/wiki/Biological_passport": "An athlete biological passport is an individual electronic record for professional athletes , in which profiles of biological markers of doping and results of doping tests are collated over a period of time . Doping violations can be detected by noting variances from an athletes established levels outside permissible limits , rather than testing for and identifying illegal substances . Although the terminology athlete passport is recent , the use of biological markers of doping has a long history in anti-doping . Maybe the first marker of doping , that tries to detect a prohibited substance not based on its presence in urine or blood , but through the induced deviations in biological parameters , is the so-called testosterone over epitestosterone ratio ( T/E ) . The T/E has been used by sports authorities since the beginning of the 1980s to detect anabolic steroids in urine samples . A decade later , in 1997 , markers of blood doping were introduced by some international federations , such as the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) and the Federation Internationale de Ski , to deter the abuse of recombinant erythropoietin that was undetectable by direct means at that time . It is only in 2002 that the concept of using biological markers to detect doping became known by the term athlete passport . The merits of this testing paradigm were exposed in the scientific literature and the terminology adopted by the World Anti-Doping agency . Many believe [ who ? ] that the athlete passport provides an excellent alternative to ensure fairness in elite sports . While a new drug test must be developed and validated for each new drug , the main advantage of the athlete passport is that it is based on the stability of the physiology of the human being . New drugs are produced at an unprecedented pace today and there is often a lag of several years between the availability of a new drug and the application of an effective detection method .",

The capital city is Chi\u0219in\u0103u . Most of the Moldovan territory was a part of the Principality of Moldavia from the 14th century until 1812 , when it was ceded to the Russian Empire by the Ottoman Empire ( to which Moldavia was a vassal state ) and became known as Bessarabia . In 1856 , southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia , which three years later united with Wallachia to form Romania , but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878 . During the 1917 Russian Revolution , Bessarabia briefly became an autonomous state within the Russian Republic , known as the Moldavian Democratic Republic . In February 1918 , the Moldavian Democratic Republic declared independence and then integrated into Romania later that year following a vote of its assembly . The decision was disputed by Soviet Russia , which in 1924 established , within the Ukrainian SSR , a Moldavian autonomous republic ( MASSR ) on partially Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of Bessarabia . In 1940 , as a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union , leading to the creation of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Moldavian SSR ) , which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR ( east of the Dniester River ) . On 27 August 1991 , as the dissolution of the Soviet Union was underway , the Moldavian SSR declared independence and took the name Moldova . The constitution of Moldova was adopted in 1994 . The strip of the Moldovan territory on the east bank of the Dniester has been under the de facto control of the breakaway government of Transnistria since 1990 .
