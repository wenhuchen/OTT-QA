  "/wiki/Tackle_(American_football)": "Tackle is a playing position in gridiron football .

The offensive tackle ( OT , T ) is a position on the offensive line , left and right . Like other offensive linemen , their job is to block : to physically keep defenders away from the offensive player who has the football and enable him to advance the football and eventually score a touchdown .

  "/wiki/Defensive_tackle": "A defensive tackle ( DT ) is typically the largest and strongest of the defensive players in American football . The defensive tackle typically lines up opposite one of the offensive guards . Depending on a team 's individual defensive scheme , a defensive tackle may be called upon to fill several different roles . These roles may include merely holding the point of attack by refusing to be moved or penetrating a certain gap between offensive linemen to break up a play in the opponent 's backfield . If a defensive tackle reads a pass play , his primary responsibility is to pursue the quarterback , or simply knock the pass down at the line if it is within arm 's reach . Other responsibilities of the defensive tackle may be to pursue the screen pass or drop into coverage in a zone blitz scheme . In a traditional 4-3 defense , there is no nose tackle . Instead there is a left and right defensive tackle . Some teams , especially in the National Football League ( NFL ) , do have a nose tackle in this scheme , but most of them do not .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",
  "/wiki/St._Louis_Rams": "In 1995 , the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League relocated the franchise from southern California to the Midwestern United States , moving to St. Louis , Missouri and becoming known as the St. Louis Rams . The Rams called St. Louis home from 1995 until the end of the 2015 season , after which they returned to playing in their former home in Los Angeles . The Rams ' relocation to St. Louis gave the city a professional football team for the first time since the end of the 1987 season . That was the last year that the now-Arizona Cardinals played there before moving to Tempe in 1988 . The relocation was the second in Rams franchise history ; the team previously called Cleveland , Ohio home until 1946 . The Rams played their home games at what is now known as The Dome at America 's Center in downtown St. Louis , which the city had been constructing for the previous few years in the hopes of gaining an NFL team . The city was left out of the expansion that brought Charlotte and Jacksonville into the league for 1995 and another attempt to secure a franchise fell through when the ownership group controlling the New England Patriots was forced out of power by their stadium 's owner and operator . The Rams new stadium was not ready for them when they initially arrived in Missouri , so they were forced to temporarily share Busch Memorial Stadium with the St. Louis Cardinals . Their first game in St. Louis against the New Orleans Saints was played on September 10 , 1995 with the Rams winning 17-13 . The then- Trans World Dome opened on November 12 , 1995 with the home team scoring a 28-17 victory against the Carolina Panthers .
