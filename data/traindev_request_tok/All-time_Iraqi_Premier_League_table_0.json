Their football team compete in the Iraqi Premier League , the top-flight of Iraqi football . Al-Zawraa are considered to be one of the biggest clubs in Iraq having won 14 league titles , more than any other Iraqi team , and having never been relegated . They won their most recent trophy in the 2018-19 season by claiming their 16th Iraq FA Cup title , also a national record . They have won the league unbeaten on a record four occasions and also hold the joint-record for the most Iraqi Elite Cups ( with three ) and the record for the most Iraqi Super Cups ( with four ) . They are one of only two teams to have won all four of the aforementioned trophies in the same season ( the 1999-2000 season ) , and they hold the joint-record for most consecutive league matches undefeated in Iraq ( 39 matches , from 1993 to 1994 ) . However , Al-Zawraa have not been able to replicate their domestic dominance on the continental stage and have not achieved any major continental honours . Their best continental achievements include finishing fourth at the 1996-97 Asian Club Championship and finishing as runners-up of the 1999-2000 Asian Cup Winners ' Cup where they lost the final to Japanese club Shimizu S-Pulse .
