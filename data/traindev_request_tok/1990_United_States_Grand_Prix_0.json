Subaru cars are known for their use of a boxer engine layout in most vehicles above 1500 cc . The Symmetrical All Wheel Drive drive-train layout was introduced in 1972 . The flat/boxer engine and all-wheel-drive became standard equipment for mid-size and smaller cars in most international markets by 1996 , and is now standard in most North American market Subaru vehicles . The lone exception is the BRZ , introduced in 2012 via a partnership with Toyota , which uses the boxer engine but instead uses a rear-wheel-drive structure . Subaru also offers turbocharged versions of their passenger cars , such as the Impreza WRX , Legacy and Outback XT , Ascent , and previously the Legacy GT and Forester XT . In Western markets , the Subaru brand has traditionally been popular among a dedicated core of buyers . Marketing is targeted towards specific niches centered on those who desire the company 's signature drive train engine , all-wheel/rough-road capabilities or affordable sports car markets . Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster M45 , or the Seven Sisters ( one of whom tradition says is invisible - hence only six stars in the Subaru logo ) , which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create FHI ."
