It is customary at formal dinners in the historic county boundaries of Lancashire and in Lancastrian regiments of the armed forces for the Loyal Toast to the crown to be announced as The Queen , Duke of Lancaster . In addition , in Lancaster it was quite common as late as the second half of the twentieth century to hear the national anthem sung as God save our gracious Queen , long live our noble Duke , but this is a tradition that has no constitutional warrant , and the British monarch is not styled legally so within either the County Palatine of Lancashire nor the Duchy of Lancaster in any official capacity ( for example , Letters Patent or Acts of Parliament ) , merely as a sign of local , 'Lancastrian ' loyalty .",

Since he died without sons , the title became extinct . The title was again created in favour of Thomas of Lancaster , the second son of King Henry IV , in 1412 . Upon his death , too , the title became extinct . The last creation in the Peerage of England was for George Plantagenet , brother of King Edward IV , in 1461 . The Duke forfeited his title in 1478 , after he had been convicted of treason against his brother . He allegedly met his end by being drowned in a butt of Malmsey ( according to William Shakespeare ) . A fourth creation in England was suggested and planned to take effect ; the title of Duke of Clarence was going to be given to Lord Guilford Dudley , husband of Lady Jane Grey , upon her coronation , as she declined to make her husband king . However , she was deposed before this could take effect . Two double dukedoms , of Clarence and St Andrews and of Clarence and Avondale , were later created for British royal princes .",

  "/wiki/John_of_Gaunt": "John of Gaunt , Duke of Lancaster ( 6 March 1340 - 3 February 1399 ) was an English prince , military leader , and statesman . He was the third of the five sons of King Edward III of England who survived to adulthood . Due to his royal origin , advantageous marriages , and some generous land grants , Gaunt was one of the richest men of his era , and an influential figure during the reigns of both his father , Edward , and his nephew , Richard II . As Duke of Lancaster , he is the founder of the royal House of Lancaster , whose members would ascend to the throne after his death . His birthplace , Ghent , corrupted into English as Gaunt , was the origin for his name . When he became unpopular later in life , scurrilous rumours and lampoons circulated that he was actually the son of a Ghent butcher , perhaps because Edward III was not present at the birth . This story always drove him to fury . John 's early career was spent in France and Spain fighting in the Hundred Years ' War . He made an abortive attempt to enforce a claim to the Crown of Castile that came through his second wife , and for a time styled himself as King of Castile . As Edward the Black Prince , Gaunt 's elder brother and heir to the ageing Edward III , became incapacitated due to poor health , Gaunt assumed control of many government functions , and rose to become one of the most powerful political figures in England . He was faced with military difficulties abroad and political divisions at home , and disagreements as to how to deal with these crises led to tensions between Gaunt , the English Parliament , and the ruling class , making him an extremely unpopular figure for a time . John exercised great influence over the English throne during the minority of King Richard II , and the ensuing periods of political strife .",
  "/wiki/Duchy_of_Lancaster": "The Duchy of Lancaster is the private estate of the British sovereign as Duke of Lancaster . The principal purpose of the estate is to provide a source of independent income to the sovereign . The estate consists of a portfolio of lands , properties and assets held in trust for the sovereign and is administered separately from the Crown Estate . The duchy consists of 18,433 ha ( 45,550 acres ) of land holdings ( including rural estates and farmland ) , urban developments , historic buildings and some commercial properties across England and Wales , particularly in Cheshire , Staffordshire , Derbyshire , Lincolnshire , Yorkshire , Lancashire and the Savoy Estate in London . The Duchy of Lancaster is one of two royal duchies : the other is the Duchy of Cornwall , which provides income to the Duke of Cornwall . In the financial year ending 31 March 2018 , the estate was valued at about \u00a3534 million . The net income of the Duchy is paid to the reigning sovereign as Duke of Lancaster : it amounts to about \u00a320 million per year . As the Duchy is an inalienable asset of the Crown held in trust for future sovereigns , the sovereign is not entitled to the portfolio 's capital or capital profits . The Duchy of Lancaster is not subject to tax , although the Sovereign has voluntarily paid both income and capital gains tax since 1993 . As such , the income received by the Privy Purse , of which income from the Duchy forms a significant part , is taxed once official expenditures have been deducted . The Duchy is administered on behalf of the sovereign by the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster , a government minister appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the prime minister , and by the clerk of the Council . Day-to-day management of the estate 's properties and investments is delegated to officers of the Duchy Council , while the Chancellor is answerable to Parliament for the effective running of the estate .",
  "/wiki/Richard_of_Bordeaux": "Richard of Bordeaux ( 1932 ) is a play by Gordon Daviot , a pseudonym for Elizabeth MacKintosh , best known by another of her pen names , Josephine Tey . The play tells the story of Richard II of England in a romantic fashion , emphasizing the relationship between Richard and his first wife , Queen Anne of Bohemia . The play was a major hit in 1933 , playing a significant role in turning its director and leading man John Gielgud into a major star . Audiences found its portrayal of medieval characters speaking like modern people refreshing .",
  "/wiki/Duke_of_York": "Duke of York is a title of nobility in the Peerage of the United Kingdom . Since the 15th century , it has , when granted , usually been given to the second son of English ( later British ) monarchs . The equivalent title in the Scottish peerage was Duke of Albany . However , King George I and Queen Victoria granted the second sons of their eldest sons the titles Duke of York and Albany and Duke of York respectively . Initially granted in the 14th century in the Peerage of England , the title Duke of York has been created eight times . The title Duke of York and Albany has been created three times . These occurred during the 18th century , following the 1707 unification of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland into a single , united realm . The double naming was done so that a territorial designation from each of the previously separate realms could be included . The current Duke of York is Prince Andrew , the second son of Queen Elizabeth II . The present Duke 's marriage produced two daughters only , and he has remained unmarried since his 1996 divorce . It therefore seems likely that the eighth creation of the title will be only the second ( after Richard of Shrewsbury ) not to become merged into the Crown upon the holder 's accession to the role of monarch .",

He was the founder of the House of York , but it was through the marriage of his younger son , Richard of Conisburgh , 3rd Earl of Cambridge , to Anne de Mortimer , great-granddaughter of Edmund 's elder brother Lionel of Antwerp , 1st Duke of Clarence , that the House of York made its claim to the English throne in the Wars of the Roses .

The title was first conferred on Thomas of Woodstock , the thirteenth child of King Edward III . The title became extinct at his death , as it did upon the death of the duke of the second creation , Humphrey of Lancaster , fourth son of King Henry IV . The title was next conferred on Richard , brother to King Edward IV . When Richard himself became king , the dukedom merged into the crown . After Richard 's death , the title was considered ominous , since the first three such dukes had all died without issue to inherit their titles . The title was not awarded for over 150 years : the next to receive the dukedom was the son of King Charles I , Henry Stuart , upon whose death the title again became extinct . Prince William , son of the future Queen Anne , was styled Duke of Gloucester for his whole life ( 1689-1700 ) , but was never formally created duke . Frederick , Prince of Wales , was styled Duke of Gloucester from 1718-1726 , but was then created Duke of Edinburgh rather than of Gloucester .

He was the second English monarch of the House of Lancaster . Despite his relatively short reign , Henry 's outstanding military successes in the Hundred Years ' War against France , most notably in his famous victory at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 , made England one of the strongest military powers in Europe . Immortalised in Shakespeare 's Henriad plays , Henry is known and celebrated as one of the greatest warrior kings of medieval England . In his youth , during the reign of his father Henry IV , Henry gained military experience fighting the Welsh during the revolt of Owain Glynd\u0175r and against the powerful aristocratic Percy family of Northumberland at the Battle of Shrewsbury . Henry acquired an increasing role in England 's government due to the king 's declining health , but disagreements between father and son led to political conflict between the two . After his father 's death in 1413 , Henry assumed control of the country and asserted the pending English claim to the French throne . In 1415 , Henry embarked on war with France in the ongoing Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) between the two nations . His military successes culminated in his famous victory at the Battle of Agincourt ( 1415 ) and saw him come close to conquering France . Taking advantage of political divisions within France , he conquered large portions of the kingdom , resulting in Normandy 's occupation by the English for the first time since 1345-1360 . After months of negotiation with Charles VI of France , the Treaty of Troyes ( 1420 ) recognised Henry V as regent and heir apparent to the French throne , and he was subsequently married to Charles 's daughter , Catherine of Valois .

Bedford was a capable administrator and soldier , and his effective management of the war brought the English to the height of their power in France .

Gloucester fought in the Hundred Years ' War and acted as Lord Protector of England during the minority of his nephew . A controversial figure , he has been characterised as reckless , unprincipled , and fractious , but is also noted for his intellectual activity and for being the first significant English patron of humanism , in the context of the Renaissance . Unlike his brothers , Humphrey was given no major military command by his father , instead receiving an intellectual upbringing . Created Duke of Gloucester in 1414 , he participated in Henry V 's campaigns during the Hundred Years ' War in France : he fought at Agincourt in 1415 and at the conquest of Normandy in 1417-9 . Following the king 's death in 1422 , Gloucester became one of the leading figures in the regency government of the infant Henry VI . He proved a rash , impulsive , unscrupulous , and troublesome figure : he quarreled constantly with his brother , John , Duke of Bedford , and uncle , Cardinal Henry Beaufort , and went so far as to violently prosecute a dispute with the Duke of Burgundy , a key English ally in France , over conflicting claims to lands in the Low Countries . At home , Gloucester never fully achieved his desired dominance , while his attempts to gain a foreign principality for himself were fruitless . A staunch opponent of concessions in the French conflict , and a proponent of offensive warfare , Gloucester increasingly lost favour among the political community , and King Henry VI himself after the end of his minority , following a series of setbacks on the war in France . The trial in 1441 of Eleanor Cobham , his second wife , under charges of witchcraft , destroyed Gloucester 's political influence .
