The first students were briefly housed at the then British colonial Governor 's House which is the current State House as they waited for the school 's completion . The founding principal/headmaster was R. H. James . Originally the school was reserved for white students only within the racial system of colonial Kenya Colony . All teachers ( masters , as they were called at the time ) , were also white . The students were drawn from the sons of British settlers , most of whom were farmers in outlying areas . This required a primarily boarding facility for the students , although originally there were a few day students who came daily . The school system was modelled after the English public school system . By the early 1960s the school was fully developed with its own well kept 9-hole golf course , rifle range , horse stables , a cricket oval with a cricket pavilion and ample sports fields for rugby , football , hockey , swimming , tennis , squash , and other sports .
