  "/wiki/George_Harrison": "George Harrison [ nb 1 ] MBE ( 25 February 1943 - 29 November 2001 ) was an English musician , singer-songwriter , and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles . Sometimes called the quiet Beatle , Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles ' work . Although the majority of the band 's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney , most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions . His songs for the group included Taxman , Within You Without You , While My Guitar Gently Weeps , Here Comes the Sun and Something . Harrison 's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt ; Carl Perkins , Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences . By 1965 , he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds , and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on Norwegian Wood ( This Bird Has Flown ) . Having initiated the band 's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967 , he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement . After the band 's break-up in 1970 , Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass , a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single , My Sweet Lord , and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist , the slide guitar . He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar , a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid . In his role as a music and film producer , Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles ' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founding HandMade Films in 1978 . Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer . In 1988 , he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys .",
  "/wiki/My_Sweet_Lord": "My Sweet Lord is a song by English musician George Harrison , released in November 1970 on his triple album All Things Must Pass . It was also released as a single , Harrison 's first as a solo artist , and topped charts worldwide ; it was the biggest-selling single of 1971 in the UK . In America and Britain , the song was the first number-one single by an ex-Beatle . Harrison originally gave the song to his fellow Apple Records artist Billy Preston to record ; this version , which Harrison co-produced , appeared on Preston 's Encouraging Words album in September 1970 . Harrison wrote My Sweet Lord in praise of the Hindu god Krishna , while intending the lyrics as a call to abandon religious sectarianism through his blending of the Hebrew word hallelujah with chants of Hare Krishna and Vedic prayer . The recording features producer Phil Spector 's Wall of Sound treatment and heralded the arrival of Harrison 's slide guitar technique , which one biographer described as musically as distinctive a signature as the mark of Zorro . Preston , Ringo Starr , Eric Clapton , and the group Badfinger are among the other musicians on the recording . Later in the 1970s , My Sweet Lord was at the centre of a heavily publicised copyright infringement suit due to its similarity to the Ronnie Mack song He 's So Fine , a 1963 hit for the New York girl group the Chiffons . In 1976 , Harrison was found to have subconsciously plagiarised the song , a verdict that had repercussions throughout the music industry . Rather than the Chiffons song , he said he used the out-of-copyright Christian hymn Oh Happy Day as his inspiration for the melody . Harrison performed My Sweet Lord at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971 , and it remains the most popular composition from his post-Beatles career . He reworked it as My Sweet Lord ( 2000 ) for inclusion as a bonus track on the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass .",
