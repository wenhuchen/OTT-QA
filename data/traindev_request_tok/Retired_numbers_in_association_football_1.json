During its history , the nation has given birth to an enormous number of notable people . Both the internal and external faces of Western culture were born on the Italian peninsula , whether one looks at the history of the Christian faith , civil institutions ( such as the Senate ) , philosophy , law , art , science , or social customs and culture . Italy was home to many well-known and influential civilizations , including the Etruscans , Samnites and the Romans , while also hosting colonies from important foreign civilizations like the Phoenicians and Greeks , whose influence and culture had a large impact through the peninsula . Etruscan and Samnite cultures flourished in Italy before the emergence of the Roman Republic , which conquered and incorporated them . Phoenicians and Greeks established settlements in Italy beginning several centuries before the birth of Christ , and the Greek settlements in particular developed into thriving classical civilizations . The Greek ruins in southern Italy are perhaps the most spectacular and best preserved anywhere . For more than 2,000 years Italy experienced migrations and invasions and was divided into numerous independent states until 1861 when it became a nation-state . Due to this comparatively late unification , and the historical autonomy of the regions that comprise the Italian peninsula , many traditions and customs that are now recognized as distinctly Italian can be identified by their regions of origin . Despite the political and social isolation of these regions , Italy 's contributions to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe and the world remain immense . The famous elements of Italian culture are its art , music , style , and iconic food .",

  "/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)": "The goalkeeper , often shortened to keeper or goalie , is one of the major positions of association football . It is the most specialised position in the sport . The goalkeeper 's primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring ( moving the ball over the defended goal-line within the frame of the goal ) . This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line . Within the penalty area goalkeepers are able to use their hands , making them ( outside throw-ins ) the only players on the field permitted to handle the ball . The special status of goalkeepers is indicated by them wearing different coloured kits from their teammates . The back-pass rule prevents goalkeepers handling direct passes back to them from teammates . Goalkeepers usually perform goal kicks , and also give commands to their defence during corner kicks , direct and indirect free kicks , and marking . Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch , giving them a unique perspective on play development . The goalkeeper is the only required position of a team . If they are injured or sent off , a substitute goalkeeper has to take their place , otherwise an outfield player must take the ejected keeper 's place in goal . In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off , a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper ( thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players ) .",
