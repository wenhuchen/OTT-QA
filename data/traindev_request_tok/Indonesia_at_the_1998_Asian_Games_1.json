  "/wiki/Lampada": "An oil lamp is an object used to produce light continuously for a period of time using an oil-based fuel source . The use of oil lamps began thousands of years ago and continues to this day , although not commonly anymore . Oil lamps are a form of lighting , and were used as an alternative to candles before the use of electric lights . Starting in 1780 , the Argand lamp quickly replaced other oil lamps still in their basic ancient form . These in turn were replaced by the kerosene lamp in about 1850 . In small towns and rural areas the latter continued in use well into the 20th century , until such areas were finally electrified and light bulbs could be used . Sources of fuel for oil lamps include a wide variety of plants such as nuts ( walnuts , almonds ) and seeds ( sesame , olive , castor , flax ) . Also widely used were animal fats ( butter , fish oil , shark liver , whale blubber , seals ) . Camphine , a blend of turpentine and alcohol , was the first burning fluid fuel for lamps after whale oil supplies were depleted . It was replaced by kerosene after Congress enacted excise taxes on alcohol to pay for the Civil War . Most modern lamps ( such as fueled lanterns ) have been replaced by gas-based or petroleum-based fuels to operate when emergency non-electric light is required . Therefore , oil lamps of today are primarily used for the particular ambience they produce .",
