  "/wiki/Kettle_(geology)": "A kettle ( kettle hole , pothole ) is a depression/hole in an outwash plain formed by retreating glaciers or draining floodwaters . The kettles are formed as a result of blocks of dead ice left behind by retreating glaciers , which become surrounded by sediment deposited by meltwater streams as there is increased friction . The ice becomes buried in the sediment and when the ice melts , a depression is left called a kettle hole , creating a dimpled appearance on the outwash plain . Lakes often fill these kettles ; these are called kettle hole lakes . Another source is the sudden drainage of an ice-dammed lake . When the block melts , the hole it leaves behind is a kettle . As the ice melts , ramparts can form around the edge of the kettle hole . The lakes that fill these holes are seldom more than 10 m ( 33 ft ) deep and eventually become filled with sediment . In acid conditions , a kettle bog may form but in alkaline conditions , it will be kettle peatland . [ clarification needed ]",

  "/wiki/Driftless_Zone": "The Driftless Area is a region in southwestern Wisconsin , southeastern Minnesota , northeastern Iowa , and the extreme northwestern corner of Illinois , of the American Midwest . The region escaped the flattening effects of glaciation during the last ice age and is consequently characterized by steep , forested ridges , deeply carved river valleys , and karst geology characterized by spring-fed waterfalls and cold-water trout streams . Ecologically , the Driftless Area 's flora and fauna are more closely related to those of the Great Lakes region and New England than those of the broader Midwest and central Plains regions . Colloquially , the term includes the incised Paleozoic Plateau of southeastern Minnesota and northeastern Iowa . The region includes elevations ranging from 603 to 1,719 feet ( 184 to 524 m ) at Blue Mound State Park and covers 24,000 square miles ( 62,200 km2 ) . The rugged terrain is due both to the lack of glacial deposits , or drift , and to the incision of the upper Mississippi River and its tributaries into bedrock . An alternative , less restrictive definition of the Driftless Area includes the sand Plains region northeast of Wisconsin 's portion of the incised Paleozoic Plateau in the southwestern part of the state . This part of the Driftless Area in the southwestern section of Wisconsin 's Central Plain also lacks evidence of glaciation ( although it was modified by glacial meltwaters that collected in Glacial Lake Wisconsin ) , and contains many isolated hills , bluffs , mesas , buttes , and pinnacles that are outlying eroded Cambrian bedrock remnants of the plateau to the southwest .",
  "/wiki/Canyon": "A canyon ( Spanish : ca\u00f1\u00f3n ; archaic British English spelling : ca\u00f1on ) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from weathering and the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales . Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces , eventually wearing away rock layers as sediments are removed downstream . A river bed will gradually reach a baseline elevation , which is the same elevation as the body of water into which the river drains . The processes of weathering and erosion will form canyons when the river 's headwaters and estuary are at significantly different elevations , particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering . A canyon may also refer to a rift between two mountain peaks , such as those in ranges including the Rocky Mountains , the Alps , the Himalayas or the Andes . Usually a river or stream carve out such splits between mountains . Examples of mountain-type canyons are Provo Canyon in Utah or Yosemite Valley in California 's Sierra Nevada . Canyons within mountains , or gorges that have an opening on only one side , are called box canyons . Slot canyons are very narrow canyons that often have smooth walls . Steep-sided valleys in the seabed of the continental slope are referred to as submarine canyons . Unlike canyons on land , submarine canyons are thought to be formed by turbidity currents and landslides .",

It has also been referred to as the Kettle Range and , in geological texts , as the Kettle Interlobate Moraine . The moraine was created when the Green Bay Lobe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet , on the west , collided with the Lake Michigan Lobe of that glacier , on the east , depositing sediment . The western lobe formed Green Bay , Lake Winnebago and the Horicon Marsh . The major part of the Kettle Moraine area is considered interlobate moraine , though other types of moraine features , and other glacial features are common .",
  "/wiki/Kame": "A kame is a glacial landform , an irregularly shaped hill or mound composed of sand , gravel and till that accumulates in a depression on a retreating glacier , and is then deposited on the land surface with further melting of the glacier . Kames are often associated with kettles , and this is referred to as kame and kettle topography . The word kame is a variant of comb ( kame , or kaim is the Old Scottish word for comb ) , which has the meaning crest among others . The geological term was introduced by Thomas Jamieson in 1874 . According to White , kames were formed by meltwater which deposited more or less washed material at irregular places in and along melting ice . At places the material is very well washed and stratified ; at others it is more poorly washed , with inclusions of till masses that fell from ice but were covered before they were completely washed . Kame gravels thus tend to be variable and range from fine to coarse grained and even to cobbly and boulder . With the melting of the glacier , streams carry sediment to glacial lakes , building kame deltas on top of the ice . However , with the continuous melting of the glacier , the kame delta eventually collapses onto the land surface , furthering the kame and kettle topography . Kame terraces are frequently found along the side of a glacial valley and are stratified deposits of meltwater streams flowing between the ice and the adjacent valley side . These kame terraces tend to look like long flat benches , with a lot of pits on the surface made by kettles . They tend to slope downvalley with gradients similar to the glacier surface along which they formed , and can sometimes be found paired on opposite sides of a valley .",

  "/wiki/Two_Creeks_Buried_Forest_State_Natural_Area": "Two Creeks Buried Forest State Natural Area is a site in the Wisconsin State Natural Areas Program and a unit of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve . The site lies in the northeast corner of Manitowoc County on the shore of Lake Michigan north of Two Creeks , Wisconsin , USA . Exposed on the steep lakeshore is a stratum of floral remains embedded in sediment , which is sandwiched between layers of glacial till . The logs , branches , pine needles , pinecones , moss , and other forest litter have been radiocarbon dated to 11,850 years B.P . [ citation needed ] ( which when calibrated gives a date range of 13,730 to 13,550 cal BP . ) [ citation needed ] This is an important site in geochronology because it firmly establishes the timeframe of advances and retreats during the last glacial period . The lower layer of glacial till was deposited by the Cary substage of the Wisconsin glaciation . The remains in the park prove that a warmer interval followed in which the glacier retreated and a forest of spruce , pine , and hemlock grew . A count of growth rings in the logs produced an average age of 60 years in these trees . Then the climate cooled again and the Valders substage began . A glacial tongue blocked Lake Michigan 's drainage , causing the water level to rise and flood the forest , carrying in sediments which buried the forest floor . The glacier proceeded to flow over the forest , flattening it and ultimately depositing another layer of glacial till over it .",
