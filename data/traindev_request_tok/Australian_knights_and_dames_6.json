When long-serving party leader Vernon Treatt announced his resignation in August 1954 , Askin put his name forward to replace him . At the vote , he became deadlocked against Pat Morton and Askin asked his former commanding officer Murray Robson to take the leadership instead . Robson did not live up to expectations and was deposed in September 1955 by Morton , who then became Leader . Askin remained as Deputy until , after leading the party to a second electoral defeat in 1959 , Morton was deposed and Askin was elected to succeed him . At the May 1965 election , Askin presented the Liberal Party as a viable alternative government . He won a narrow victory , ending a 24-year Labor hold on government .",

As the Queen is concurrently the monarch of 15 other Commonwealth realms , and lives in the United Kingdom ( as her principal residence ) , she , on the advice of her New Zealand prime minister , appoints a governor-general to carry out her constitutional and ceremonial duties within the Realm of New Zealand . The current office traces its origins to when the administration of New Zealand was placed under the Colony of New South Wales in 1839 and its governor was given jurisdiction over New Zealand . However , New Zealand would become its own colony the next year with its own governor . The modern governor-general and his or her functions came into being in 1917 and the office is currently mandated by Letters Patent issued in 1983 , constituting the Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of the Realm of New Zealand . Constitutional functions of the governor-general include presiding over the Executive Council , appointing ministers and judges , granting royal assent to legislation , and summoning and dissolving parliament . These functions are generally exercised only according to the advice of an elected government . The governor-general also has an important ceremonial role : hosting events at Government House in Wellington , and travelling throughout New Zealand to open conferences , attend services and commemorations and generally provide encouragement to individuals and groups who are contributing to their communities . When travelling abroad , the governor-general is seen as the representative of New Zealand ; for this reason , the governor-general is viewed by some as the de facto head of state . The governor-general ( titled governor before 1917 ) initially represented the British monarch and the British Government . Therefore , many past officeholders were British , including a succession of minor aristocrats from the 1890s onwards . In a gradual process , culminating with the adoption of the Statute of Westminster in 1947 , the governor-general has become the independent , personal representative of the New Zealand monarch .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",
