  "/wiki/USS_Arizona_(shipwreck)": "USS Arizona was a Pennsylvania-class battleship built for the United States Navy in the mid-1910s . Named in honor of the 48th state 's recent admission into the union , the ship was the second and last of the Pennsylvania class of super-dreadnought battleships . Although commissioned in 1916 , the ship remained stateside during World War I . Shortly after the end of the war , Arizona was one of a number of American ships that briefly escorted President Woodrow Wilson to the Paris Peace Conference . The ship was sent to Turkey in 1919 at the beginning of the Greco-Turkish War to represent American interests for several months . Several years later , she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet and remained there for the rest of her career . Aside from a comprehensive modernization in 1929-1931 , Arizona was regularly used for training exercises between the wars , including the annual Fleet Problems ( training exercises ) . When an earthquake struck Long Beach , California , on 10 March 1933 , Arizona 's crew provided aid to the survivors . In July 1934 , the ship was featured in a James Cagney film , Here Comes the Navy , about the romantic troubles of a sailor . In April 1940 , she and the rest of the Pacific Fleet were transferred from California to Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , as a deterrent to Japanese imperialism . Arizona was hit by Japanese torpedo bombers during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 . After one of their bombs detonated in a magazine , she exploded violently and sank , with the loss of 1,177 officers and crewmen .",
  "/wiki/Pearl_Harbor": "Pearl Harbor is an American lagoon harbor on the island of Oahu , Hawaii , west of Honolulu . It has been long visited by the Naval fleet of the United States , before it was acquired from the Hawaiian Kingdom by the U.S. with the signing of the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 . Much of the harbor and surrounding lands is now a United States Navy deep-water naval base . It is also the headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet . The U.S. government first obtained exclusive use of the inlet and the right to maintain a repair and coaling station for ships here in 1887 . The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7 , 1941 , was the immediate cause of the United States ' entry into World War II .",

  "/wiki/Empire_of_Japan": "The Empire of Japan ( \u5927\u65e5\u672c\u5e1d\u570b , Dai Nippon Teikoku , literally Empire of Great Japan ) was the historical nation-state [ nb 2 ] and great power that existed from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 to the enactment of the 1947 constitution of modern Japan . Japan 's rapid industrialization and militarization under the slogan Fukoku Ky\u014dhei ( \u5bcc\u570b\u5f37\u5175 , Enrich the Country , Strengthen her Armed Forces ) and Shokusan K\u014dgy\u014d ( \u6b96\u7523\u8208\u696d , Promote Industry ) led to its emergence as a world power and the establishment of a colonial empire following the First Sino-Japanese War , the Boxer Rebellion , the Russo-Japanese War , and World War I . Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism and totalitarianism , eventually culminating in Japan 's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific in World War II . Japan 's armed forces initially achieved large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) and the Pacific War . However , after many Allied victories and following the Soviet Union 's declaration of war against Japan on August 9 , 1945 , and subsequent invasion of Manchuria and other territories , and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Empire surrendered to the Allies on August 15 , 1945 . A period of occupation by the Allies followed . In 1947 , with American involvement , a new constitution was enacted , officially bringing the Empire of Japan to an end . Occupation and reconstruction continued until 1952 , eventually forming the current constitutional monarchy known as Japan . The Emperors during this time , which spanned the entire Meiji , Taish\u014d , and the lesser part of the Sh\u014dwa era , are now known in Japan by their posthumous names , which coincide with those era names : Emperor Meiji ( Mutsuhito ) , Emperor Taish\u014d ( Yoshihito ) , and Emperor Sh\u014dwa ( Hirohito ) .",

The attack led to the United States ' formal entry into World War II the next day . The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI , and as Operation Z during its planning . Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States . Over the course of seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines , Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya , Singapore , and Hong Kong . The attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time ( 18:18 GMT ) . [ nb 4 ] The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese aircraft ( including fighters , level and dive bombers , and torpedo bombers ) in two waves , launched from six aircraft carriers .

A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property . The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80,000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts .

Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , as well as coordinate , identify and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians .

  "/wiki/Submarine": "A submarine ( or sub ) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater . It differs from a submersible , which has more limited underwater capability . It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots , as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels , such as the midget submarine and the wet sub . Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size . Although experimental submarines had been built before , submarine design took off during the 19th century , and they were adopted by several navies . Submarines were first widely used during World War I ( 1914-1918 ) , and are now used in many navies large and small . Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships ( merchant and military ) , or other submarines , aircraft carrier protection , blockade running , ballistic missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force , reconnaissance , conventional land attack ( for example using a cruise missile ) , and covert insertion of special forces . Civilian uses for submarines include marine science , salvage , exploration and facility inspection and maintenance . Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair . Submarines are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology . Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical ( or conical ) ends and a vertical structure , usually located amidships , which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes . In modern submarines , this structure is the sail in American usage and fin in European usage .",
  "/wiki/World_War_II": "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 . The vast majority of the world 's countries - including all the great powers - eventually formed two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa , and the Fall of France in mid 1940 , the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire .

  "/wiki/Archaeology": "Archaeology , or archeology , is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture . The archaeological record consists of artifacts , architecture , biofacts or ecofacts and cultural landscapes . Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities . In Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines , while in North America archaeology is a sub-field of anthropology . Archaeologists study human prehistory and history , from the development of the first stone tools at Lomekwi in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades . Archaeology is distinct from palaeontology , which is the study of fossil remains . It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies , for whom there may be no written records to study . Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past , from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in societies across the world . Archaeology has various goals , which range from understanding culture history to reconstructing past lifeways to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time . The discipline involves surveying , excavation and eventually analysis of data collected to learn more about the past . In broad scope , archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research . It draws upon anthropology , history , art history , classics , ethnology , geography , geology , literary history , linguistics , semiology , sociology , textual criticism , physics , information sciences , chemistry , statistics , paleoecology , paleography , paleontology , paleozoology , and paleobotany .",

  "/wiki/Ancient_Hawaiian_aquaculture": "The Hawaiian people practiced aquaculture through development of fish ponds ( Hawaiian : loko i\u02bba ) , the most advanced fish husbandry among the original peoples of the Pacific . These fishponds were typically shallow areas of a reef flat surrounded by a low lava rock wall ( loko kuapa ) built out from the shore . Several species of edible fish ( such as mullet ) thrive in such ponds , and Hawaiians developed methods to make them easy to catch . The Hawaiian fishpond was primarily a grazing area in which the fishpond keeper cultivated algae ; much in the way a cattle rancher cultivates grass for his cattle . The porous lava walls let in seawater ( or sometimes fresh or brackish water , as in the case of the Menehune fishpond near L\u012bhu\u02bbe , Kaua\u02bbi ) , but prevent the fish from escaping . Fishponds were located next to the mouth of a stream , so by opening a sluice gate the pondkeeper provided the fish with water rich in nutrients that had passed through inland , terraced pondfields and returned to the stream . At the time of Captain James Cook 's arrival , there were at least 360 fishponds producing 2,000,000 pounds ( 900,000 kg ) of fish per year . Several fishponds have been restored in recent years . Although fishponds were developed on most islands , the largest number were found in Ke\u02bbehi Lagoon , Pearl Harbor , and K\u0101ne\u02bbohe Bay on O\u02bbahu , and along nearly the entire south shore of Moloka\u02bbi .

  "/wiki/Petroglyph": "A petroglyph is an image created by removing part of a rock surface by incising , picking , carving , or abrading , as a form of rock art . Outside North America , scholars often use terms such as carving , engraving , or other descriptions of the technique to refer to such images . Petroglyphs are found worldwide , and are often associated with prehistoric peoples . The word comes from the Greek prefix petro- , from \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 petra meaning stone , and \u03b3\u03bb\u03cd\u03c6\u03c9 gl\u00fdph\u014d meaning carve , and was originally coined in French as p\u00e9troglyphe . Another form of petroglyph , normally found in literate cultures , a rock relief or rock-cut relief is a relief sculpture carved on living rock such as a cliff , rather than a detached piece of stone . While these relief carvings are a category of rock art , sometimes found in conjunction with rock-cut architecture , they tend to be omitted in most works on rock art , which concentrate on engravings and paintings by prehistoric or nonliterate cultures . Some of these reliefs exploit the rock 's natural properties to define an image . Rock reliefs have been made in many cultures , especially in the ancient Near East . Rock reliefs are generally fairly large , as they need to be to make an impact in the open air . Most have figures that are larger than life-size . Stylistically , a culture 's rock relief carvings relate to other types of sculpture from period concerned . Except for Hittite and Persian examples , they are generally discussed as part of the culture 's sculptural practice .",

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on L : December 29 , 1962 . The fishpond may have started as a sandbar where ocean currents met the stream mouth . A 500-foot ( 150 m ) permeable rock seawall ( called kuap\u0101 in Hawaiian ) was added along the shoreline to enclose about 7 acres ( 28,000 m2 ) of fertile brackish water . The wall was about 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) wide and stood about 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) above high tide , with two lashed-pole gates ( called m\u0101k\u0101h\u0101 ) that allowed little fish in but kept bigger fish from escaping . The name Huilua , which can be translated 'join-twice ' , may refer to the two gates . The favorite type of fish in the pond were \u02bbama\u02bbama ( mullet ) , which reproduce in the ocean but can live in either fresh , brackish , or salt water . Many Hawaiian fishponds were built about 400 to 600 years ago . They were especially numerous in large expanses of shallow sea , such as K\u0101ne\u02bbohe Bay and Pearl Harbor . Each fishpond had a pondkeeper ( kia\u02bbi loko ) who lived nearby and oversaw its maintenance .

  "/wiki/Coast": "The coast , also known as the coastline or seashore , is the area where land meets the sea or ocean , or a line that forms the boundary between the land and the ocean or a lake . A precise line that can be called a coastline can not be determined due to the coastline paradox . The term coastal zone is a region where interaction of the sea and land processes occurs . Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region ( e.g. , New Zealand 's West Coast , or the East and West Coasts of the United States ) . Edinburgh is an example city on the coast of Great Britain . The term pelagic coast refers to a coast that fronts the open ocean , as opposed to a more sheltered coast in a gulf or bay . A shore , on the other hand , can refer to parts of land adjoining any large body of water , including oceans ( seashore ) and lakes ( lake shore ) . Similarly , the somewhat related term stream bed or stream bank refers to the land alongside or sloping down to a river ( riverbank ) or body of water smaller than a lake . Bank is also used in some parts of the world to refer to an artificial ridge of earth intended to retain the water of a river or pond ; in other places this may be called a levee . While many scientific experts might agree on a common definition of the term coast , the delineation of the extents of a coast differ according to jurisdiction , with many scientific and government authorities in various countries differing for economic and social policy reasons . According to the UN atlas , 44% of people live within 150 km ( 93 mi ) of the sea .",

An infected person may also experience muscle weakness and poor eyesight . Leprosy symptoms may begin within one year , however , for some people symptoms may take 20 years or more to occur . Leprosy is spread between people , although extensive contact is necessary . About 95% of people who contract M. leprae do not develop the disease . Spread is thought to occur through a cough or contact with fluid from the nose of a person infected by leprosy . Genetic factors and immune function play a role in how easily a person catches the disease . Leprosy does not spread during pregnancy to the unborn children or through sexual contact . Leprosy occurs more commonly among people living in poverty . The two main types of disease - paucibacillary and multibacillary - differ in the number of bacteria present .",

In 2010 , a study was published based on radiocarbon dating of more reliable samples which suggests that the islands were settled much later , within a short timeframe , in about 1219 to 1266 . The islands in Eastern Polynesia have been characterized by the continuities among their cultures , and the short migration period would be an explanation of this result . Diversified agroforestry and aquaculture provided sustenance for Native Hawaiian cuisine . Tropical materials were adopted for housing . Elaborate temples ( called heiau ) were constructed from the lava rocks available . The rich natural resources supported a relatively dense population , organized by a ruling class and social system with religious leaders .

In the past , Hawaiian lava sledding was considered both a sport and a religious ritual for honoring the gods .",
  "/wiki/Toboggan": "A toboggan is a simple sled which is a traditional form of transport used by the Innu and Cree of northern Canada . In modern times , it is used on snow to carry one or more people ( often children ) down a hill or other slope for recreation . Designs vary from simple , traditional models to modern engineered composites . A toboggan differs from most sleds or sleighs in that it has no runners or skis ( or only low ones ) on the underside . The bottom of a toboggan rides directly on the snow . Some parks include designated toboggan hills where ordinary sleds are not allowed and which may include toboggan runs similar to bobsleigh courses . Toboggans can vary depending on the climate and geographical region . Such examples are Tangalooma ( Australia ) where toboggans are made from Masonite boards and used for travelling down steep sand dunes at speeds up to 40 km/h ( 25 mph ) .",

  "/wiki/Lahaina_Historic_District": "Lahaina Historic District is a National Historic Landmark District encompassing most of the community of Lahaina , Hawaii , on the west side of the island of Maui in the US state of Hawaii . Designated in 1962 , the district recognizes Lahaina for its well-preserved character as a 19th-century port , and for its social and economic importance in the 19th century as a major whaling center in the Pacific , and as one of the capital cities of the Kingdom of Hawaii . Donn Beach and Pete Wimberly played an important early role in establishing building ordinances to govern restoration and preservation projects in Lahaina . It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1962 . The district is bounded on the north by Pu\u02bbuona Point , the south by Makila Point , and the east by the ridge of hills above the town . Its western bound extends all the way out to the island of L\u0101na\u02bbi , encompassing the Lahaina Roads , the roadstead which enabled the town 's growth in the 19th century . Lahaina was a popular residential center for the kings of Maui prior to the arrival of European explorers in the late 18th century . Kamehameha I made his landing here when he began the conquest of Maui in 1795 , and Kamehameha II established a residence here in 1819 . That same year , the first whaling ships arrived , beginning the community 's rise in economic importance . Lahaina eclipsed Oahu as a preferred whaling port between 1840 and 1855 , because of its better deep-water anchorage . When Kamehameha III ascended to the Hawaiian throne in 1825 , he made Lahaina his capital , preferring it to the busier Honolulu . The town declined in economic importance in the 1860s , as the whaling industry waned .",

  "/wiki/Sovereign_state": "A sovereign state , in international law , is a political entity that is represented by one centralized government that has sovereignty over a geographic area . International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population , defined territory , one government , and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states . It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state . According to the declarative theory of statehood , a sovereign state can exist without being recognised by other sovereign states . Unrecognised states will often find it difficult to exercise full treaty-making powers or engage in diplomatic relations with other sovereign states .",
  "/wiki/Temple": "A temple ( from the Latin word templum ) is a building reserved for religious or spiritual rituals and activities such as prayer and sacrifice . It is typically used for such buildings belonging to all faiths where a more specific term such as church , mosque or synagogue is not generally used in English . These include Hinduism , Buddhism , and Jainism among religions with many modern followers , as well as other ancient religions such as Ancient Egyptian religion . The form and function of temples is thus very variable , though they are often considered by believers to be in some sense the house of one or more deities . Typically offerings of some sort are made to the deity , and other rituals enacted , and a special group of clergy maintain , and operate the temple . The degree to which the whole population of believers can access the building varies significantly ; often parts or even the whole main building can only be accessed by the clergy . Temples typically have a main building and a larger precinct , which may contain many other buildings , or may be a dome shaped structure , much like an igloo . The word comes from Ancient Rome , where a templum constituted a sacred precinct as defined by a priest , or augur . It has the same root as the word template , a plan in preparation of the building that was marked out on the ground by the augur . Templa also became associated with the dwelling places of a god or gods . Despite the specific set of meanings associated with the word , it has now become widely used to describe a house of worship for any number of religions and is even used for time periods prior to the Romans .",
  "/wiki/Human_sacrifice": "Human sacrifice is the act of killing one or more humans , usually as an offering to a deity , as part of a ritual . Human sacrifice has been practiced in various cultures throughout history . Victims were typically ritually killed in a manner intended to please or appease gods , spirits or the deceased , for example , as a propitiatory offering or as a retainer sacrifice when a king 's servants are killed in order for them to continue to serve their master in the next life . Closely related practices found in some tribal societies are cannibalism and headhunting . By the Iron Age , with the associated developments in religion ( the Axial Age ) , human sacrifice was becoming less common throughout the Old World , and came to be looked down upon as barbaric in classical antiquity . In the New World , however , human sacrifice continued to be widespread to varying degrees until the European colonization of the Americas . In modern times , even the practice of animal sacrifice has disappeared from some religions , and human sacrifice has become extremely rare . Most religions condemn the practice , and modern secular laws treat it as murder . In a society which condemns human sacrifice , the term ritual murder is used .",

  "/wiki/Prehistory": "Human prehistory is the period between the use of the first stone tools c. 3.3 million years ago by hominins and the invention of writing systems . The earliest writing systems appeared c. 5,300 years ago , but it took thousands of years for writing to be widely adopted , and it was not used in some human cultures until the 19th century or even until the present . The end of prehistory therefore came at very different dates in different places , and the term is less often used in discussing societies where prehistory ended relatively recently . Sumer in Mesopotamia , the Indus valley civilization , and ancient Egypt were the first civilizations to develop their own scripts and to keep historical records ; this took place already during the early Bronze Age . Neighboring civilizations were the first to follow . Most other civilizations reached the end of prehistory during the Iron Age . The three-age system of division of prehistory into the Stone Age , followed by the Bronze Age and Iron Age , remains in use for much of Eurasia and North Africa , but is not generally used in those parts of the world where the working of hard metals arrived abruptly with contact with Eurasian cultures , such as the Americas , Oceania , Australasia and much of Sub-Saharan Africa . These areas also , with some exceptions in Pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas , did not develop complex writing systems before the arrival of Eurasians , and their prehistory reaches into relatively recent periods ; for example 1788 is usually taken as the end of the prehistory of Australia . The period when a culture is written about by others , but has not developed its own writing is often known as the protohistory of the culture . By definition , there are no written records from human prehistory , so dating of prehistoric materials is crucial . Clear techniques for dating were not well-developed until the 19th century . This article is concerned with human prehistory , the time since behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appeared until the beginning of recorded history .",

  "/wiki/Tool": "A tool is an object used to extend the ability of an individual to modify features of the surrounding environment . Although many animals use simple tools , only human beings , whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia , use tools to make other tools . The set of tools required to perform different tasks that are part of the same activity is called gear or equipment . While one may apply the term tool loosely to many things that are means to an end ( e.g. , a fork ) , strictly speaking an object is a tool only if , besides being constructed to be held , it is also made of a material that allows its user to apply to it various degrees of force . If repeated use wears part of the tool down ( like a knife blade ) , it may be possible to restore it ; if it wears the tool out or breaks it , the tool must be replaced . Thus tool falls under the taxonomic category implement , and is on the same taxonomic rank as instrument , utensil , device , or ware .",
  "/wiki/Religion": "Religion is a social-cultural system of designated behaviors and practices , morals , worldviews , texts , sanctified places , prophecies , ethics , or organizations , that relates humanity to supernatural , transcendental , or spiritual elements . However , there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion . Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the divine , sacred things , faith , a supernatural being or supernatural beings or some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life . Religious practices may include rituals , sermons , commemoration or veneration ( of deities ) , sacrifices , festivals , feasts , trances , initiations , funerary services , matrimonial services , meditation , prayer , music , art , dance , public service , or other aspects of human culture . Religions have sacred histories and narratives , which may be preserved in sacred scriptures , and symbols and holy places , that aim mostly to give a meaning to life . Religions may contain symbolic stories , which are sometimes said by followers to be true , that have the side purpose of explaining the origin of life , the universe , and other things . Traditionally , faith , in addition to reason , has been considered a source of religious beliefs . There are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions worldwide , but about 84% of the world 's population is affiliated with one of the five largest religion groups , namely Christianity , Islam , Hinduism , Buddhism or forms of folk religion . The religiously unaffiliated demographic includes those who do not identify with any particular religion , atheists , and agnostics . While the religiously unaffiliated have grown globally , many of the religiously unaffiliated still have various religious beliefs . The study of religion encompasses a wide variety of academic disciplines , including theology , comparative religion and social scientific studies . Theories of religion offer various explanations for the origins and workings of religion , including the ontological foundations of religious being and belief .",
