The film was commercially released in the United States and Canada on November 21 , 2007 ; it performed well at the box office and received generally positive reviews . Darabont has since revealed that he had always had it in mind to shoot The Mist in black and white , a decision inspired by such iconic films as Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 ) and the pre-color work of Ray Harryhausen . While the film 's cinematic release was in color , the director has described the black and white print ( released on Blu-ray in 2008 ) as his preferred version . The director revised the ending of the film to be darker than the novella 's ending , a change to which King was amenable . Darabont also sought unique creature designs to differentiate them from his creatures in past films .
