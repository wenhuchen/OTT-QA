The M5S was founded on 4 October 2009 by Beppe Grillo , a comedian and blogger , and Gianroberto Casaleggio , a web strategist . In 2014 Grillo appointed a directorate composed of five leading MPs ( Alessandro Di Battista , Luigi Di Maio , Roberto Fico , Carla Ruocco and Carlo Sibilia ) , which lasted until the following October when he dissolved it and proclaimed himself the political head of the M5S . Grillo is also formally president of the association named the Five Star Movement ; his nephew , Enrico Grillo , serves as vice president ; and his accountant , Enrico Maria Nadasi , as secretary . Davide Casaleggio , Gianroberto 's son , has an increasingly important albeit unofficial role . The M5S is variously considered populist , anti-establishment , environmentalist , anti-globalist , and Eurosceptic . The party has also been described as New Right and described by some as being right-wing due to its anti-immigration stance despite its promotion of policies usually advocated by the Italian left-wing , such as citizen 's income and green-inspired policies . Grillo himself once provocatively referred to the movement as populist . Its members stress that the M5S is not a party but a movement , and it may not be included in the traditional left-right paradigm . The five stars are a reference to five key issues for the party : public water , sustainable transport , sustainable development , right to Internet access , and environmentalism . The party also advocates e-democracy , direct democracy , the principle of zero-cost politics , degrowth and nonviolence . In the 2013 general election , the M5S won the most votes of all parties ( excluding votes from Italians abroad ) for the Chamber of Deputies .",

Lorenzo Cesa is the party 's current secretary ; Pier Ferdinando Casini was for years the most recognisable figure and de facto leader of the party , before eventually distancing from it in 2016 . The UdC is a member of the European People 's Party ( EPP ) and the Centrist Democrat International ( CDI ) , of which Casini was president from 2004 to 2015 . The party was formed as Union of Christian and Centre Democrats in December 2002 upon the merger of the Christian Democratic Centre ( CCD ) , the United Christian Democrats ( CDU ) and European Democracy ( DE ) . In 2008 the party was the driving force behind the Union of the Centre ( UdC ) , an alliance comprising , among others , The Rose for Italy , the Populars for the Constituent Assembly of the Centre , the Liberal Clubs , the Party of Christian Democracy , the Christian Democratic Party , Veneto for the European People 's Party , the Democratic Populars and the Autonomist Democrats . Since then , the party 's official name was neglected in favour of the alliance 's and , since most of the UdC member parties have joined the UDC too , the UDC and the UdC started to overlap almost completely to the point that they are now undistinguishable . The CCD was an early ally of Silvio Berlusconi 's Forza Italia in 1994 and was part of the centre-right Pole/House of Freedoms since its establishment . Consequently , the UDC was consistently part of the centre-right until 2006 . Later , it was affiliated neither to the centre-right nor the centre-left at the national level . Despite this , the party continued to take part in several regional , provincial and municipal governments with the old and the new Forza Italia , while forming alliances also with the centre-left Democratic Party in some regions and cities . In the 2013 general election the UdC was part of With Monti for Italy , the coalition formed around Mario Monti 's Civic Choice , and obtained a mere 1.8% of the vote , down from 5.6% in 2008 and 6.8% in 2006 .
