  "/wiki/Pitcher": "In baseball , the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher 's mound toward the catcher to begin each play , with the goal of retiring a batter , who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the pitcher is assigned the number 1 . The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game , and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum . There are many different types of pitchers , such as the starting pitcher , relief pitcher , middle reliever , lefty specialist , setup man , and the closer . Traditionally , the pitcher also bats . Starting in 1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of designated hitter , a cause of some controversy . The National League in Major League Baseball and the Japanese Central League are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position .",

  "/wiki/Strikeouts": "In baseball or softball , a strikeout ( or strike-out ) occurs when a batter racks up three strikes during a time at bat . It usually means the batter is out . A strikeout is a statistic recorded for both pitchers and batters , and is denoted by K. A strikeout looking - in which the batter does not swing and the third strike is called by the umpire - is usually denoted by a \ua4d8 . Although a strikeout suggests that the pitcher dominated the batter , the free-swinging style that generates home runs also leaves batters susceptible to striking out . Some of the greatest home run hitters of all time - such as Alex Rodriguez , Reggie Jackson , and Jim Thome - were notorious for striking out .",
  "/wiki/Q.V._Lowe": "Q. V. Lowe ( born January 15 , 1945 ) is a retired American baseball coach . From 1987-2014 , he was the men 's varsity baseball coach of Auburn Montgomery ( also known as Auburn University Montgomery , or AUM ) - where he established the baseball program and served for 28 consecutive seasons ; he compiled a win-loss record of 1,242-689-5 ( .643 ) . He also is a former pitcher , coach and manager in minor league baseball and in 1972 , at age 27 , spent a season as a full-time coach for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball , working under managers Leo Durocher and Whitey Lockman . Lowe was born at Red Level , Alabama . He grew up in Ocala , Florida , attended Gulf Coast Community College and graduated from Auburn University . A right-handed pitcher ( and hitter ) , he was listed at 6 ft 1 in ( 1.85 m ) tall and 185 lb ( 84 kg ) during his playing career . In two seasons at Auburn , he won 23 of 26 decisions ( .885 ) and set an Auburn Tigers record for career earned-run average ( 1.69 ) and most complete games ( ten ) in one season . He was selected in the 19th round of the 1967 Major League Baseball draft by the Cubs and compiled a won/lost mark of 24-25 with an ERA of 3.37 in 167 games over five minor-league seasons ( 1967-71 ) , most of them at the Double-A level . During his final two seasons , he was a player-coach for the San Antonio Missions of the Texas League . In 1972 , Lowe joined the Cubs ' coaching staff , serving as bullpen coach . The midyear managerial change , in which Lockman replaced Durocher , resulted in changes on the Cubs ' 1973 MLB staff , and Lowe returned to the minor leagues as manager of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast Cubs ( 1973 ) and the Class A Key West Conchs ( for the second half of the 1974 season ) . Lowe then coached in the New York Yankees ' farm system , and also became baseball coach , and eventually athletic director , of Lurleen B. Wallace Community College between 1975-81 .",

  "/wiki/Hits_per_nine_innings": "In baseball statistics , hits per nine innings ( denoted by H/9 ) is the average number of hits allowed by a pitcher in a nine inning period ; calculated as : ( hits allowed x 9 ) / innings pitched . This is a measure of a pitcher 's success based on the number of all outs he records . Compared to a pitcher 's batting average against , a pitcher 's H/9 benefits from sacrifice bunts , double plays , runners caught stealing , and outfield assists , but it is hurt by some errors . Unlike batting average against , a pitcher 's H/9 benefits from outs that are not related to official at bats , as they are recorded on runners after they have reached base . Through 2019 Nolan Ryan is the career leader , at 6.5553 , while Clayton Kershaw is # 2 ( 6.7856 ) , and Sandy Koufax is # 3 ( 6.7916 ) .",
  "/wiki/Catcher": "Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player . When a batter takes his/her turn to hit , the catcher crouches behind home plate , in front of the ( home ) umpire , and receives the ball from the pitcher . In addition to this primary duty , the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well . The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket , but in cricket , wicketkeepers are increasingly known for their batting abilities . Positioned behind home plate , the catcher can see the whole field , and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play . The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals . The calls are based on the pitcher 's mechanics and strengths , as well as the batter 's tendencies and weaknesses . Foul tips , bouncing balls in the dirt , and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher , necessitating the use of protective equipment . This includes a mask , chest and throat protectors , shin guards , and a heavily padded catcher 's mitt . Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game 's strategies , the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball , including such prominent examples as Connie Mack , Steve O'Neill , Al L\u00f3pez , Mike Scioscia , and Joe Torre . The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season , and can have a negative effect on their offensive output . Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching , if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills , teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses .",

  "/wiki/First_baseman": "First base , or 1B , is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player 's team . A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base , and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the first baseman is assigned the number 3 . Also called first sacker or cornerman , the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes . Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders , the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls . In order for the runner to be called out , the first baseman must be able to stretch towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base . First base is often referred to as the other hot corner - the hot corner being third base - and therefore , like the third baseman , he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line , mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field . They often are power hitters who have a substantial number of home runs and extra base hits while maintaining a .270 plus batting average . [ citation needed ]",

  "/wiki/Second_baseman": "In baseball and softball , second baseman is a fielding position in the infield , between second and first base . The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet , needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly , and must be able to make the pivot on a double play . In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950 . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well .",

  "/wiki/Third_baseman": "A third baseman , abbreviated 3B , is the player in baseball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base - the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run . In the scoring system used to record defensive plays , the third baseman is assigned the number ' 5 ' . The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls , as he is often the closest infielder ( roughly 90-120 feet ) to the batter . The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm , as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base . The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play . The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territory . Third base is known as the hot corner , because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction . A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km/h ) . Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected , creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply . As with middle infielders , right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base . Mike Squires , who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983 , is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty . Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast .",

  "/wiki/Shortstop": "Shortstop , abbreviated SS , is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base , which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions . Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order . Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup . In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays , the shortstop is assigned the number 6 . More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position , as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters , and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly . Like a second baseman , a shortstop must be agile , for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play . Also , like a third baseman , the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield , where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base .",

  "/wiki/Triple_(baseball)": "In baseball , a triple is the act of a batter safely reaching third base after hitting the ball , with neither the benefit of a fielder 's misplay ( see error ) nor another runner being put out on a fielder 's choice . A triple is sometimes called a three-bagger or three-base hit . For statistical and scorekeeping purposes it is denoted by 3B . Triples have become somewhat rare in Major League Baseball . It often requires a ball hit to a distant part of the field , or the ball taking an unusual bounce in the outfield . It also usually requires that the batter hit the ball solidly , and be a speedy runner . It also often requires that the batter 's team have a good strategic reason for wanting the batter on third base , as a double will already put the batter in scoring position and there will often be little strategic advantage to taking the risk of trying to stretch a double into a triple . ( The inside-the-park home run is much rarer than a triple ) . The trend for modern ballparks is to have smaller outfields ( often increasing the number of home runs ) ; it has ensured that the career and season triples leaders mostly consist of those who played early in Major League Baseball history , generally in the dead-ball era . A walk-off triple ( one that ends a game ) occurs very infrequently . For example , the 2016 MLB season saw only three walk-off triples , excluding one play that was actually a triple plus an error .",
