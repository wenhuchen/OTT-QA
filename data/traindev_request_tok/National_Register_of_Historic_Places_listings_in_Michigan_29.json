  "/wiki/Carnegie_Library": "A Carnegie library is a library built with money donated by Scottish-American businessman and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie .

At first , Carnegie libraries were almost exclusively in places where he had a personal connection - namely his birthplace in Scotland and the Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania area , his adopted home-town . Yet , beginning in the middle of 1899 , Carnegie substantially increased funding to libraries outside these areas . In later years few towns that requested a grant and agreed to his terms were refused . By the time the last grant was made in 1919 , there were 3,500 libraries in the United States , nearly half of them built with construction grants paid by Carnegie .",

  "/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture": "Romanesque Revival ( or Neo-Romanesque ) is a style of building employed beginning in the mid-19th century inspired by the 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque architecture . Unlike the historic Romanesque style , however , Romanesque Revival buildings tended to feature more simplified arches and windows than their historic counterparts . An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",

Major examples of the style include the Op\u00e9ra Garnier ( 1862-1871 ) in Paris by Charles Garnier , the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France , and the Church of Saint Augustine ( 1860-1871 ) .

  "/wiki/Prairie_School": "Prairie School is a late 19th- and early 20th-century architectural style , most common in the Midwestern United States . The style is usually marked by horizontal lines , flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves , windows grouped in horizontal bands , integration with the landscape , solid construction , craftsmanship , and discipline in the use of ornament . Horizontal lines were thought to evoke and relate to the wide , flat , treeless expanses of America 's native prairie landscape . The Prairie School was an attempt at developing an indigenous North American style of architecture in symphony with the ideals and design aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts Movement , with which it shared an embrace of handcrafting and craftsman guilds as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of mass production . The term Prairie School was not actually used by practitioners of the style . Architect Marion Mahony , for example , preferred the phrase The Chicago Group . Its term was coined by H. Allen Brooks , one of the first architectural historians to write extensively about the movement and its work .",
