It was situated near a triangular piece of land known as Gore Field . Stanton Hill was first mentioned in the census in 1871 , and then only as a street within Skegby . It probably took its name from the Stanton Ironworks Company , which started sinking the Teversal ( Butcher Wood ) Colliery in 1867 , and later the Silverhill Colliery in 1878 . Many of the workers for these new collieries moved from other coalmining areas including Shropshire , Staffordshire , Derbyshire , and Leicestershire . Skegby Colliery was replaced by New Skegby Colliery ( later renamed Sutton Colliery ) in 1873 . It was also known as Brierley Colliery , possibly renamed by the many Staffordshire colliers moving from the Brierley Hill area . This was later taken over by the Blackwell Colliery Company . The huge increase in population of Skegby - from 805 in 1869 to over 3,000 in 1884 - meant that new housing was required in the immediate area .
