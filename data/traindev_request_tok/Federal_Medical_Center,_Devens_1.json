  "/wiki/John_Franzese": "John Sonny Franzese Sr. ( Italian : [ \u02c8frantse\u02d0ze ; -e\u02d0se ] ; born February 6 , 1917 [ nb 1 ] ) is an Italian-American mobster who is a longtime member of the Colombo crime family . Franzese 's career in organized crime began in the 1930s and spans over eight decades . He served as underboss of the Colombo family from 1963 , until he was sentenced to 50 years in prison for bank robbery charges in 1967 . He was paroled in 1978 , but was re-jailed at least six times on parole violations throughout the decades that followed . He became Colombo family underboss again in 2004 , until he was convicted of extortion in 2011 , and sentenced to eight years in prison . His son John Franzese Jr. had testified against him , becoming the first son of a New York mobster to turn state 's evidence and testify against his father . At the time of his release on June 23 , 2017 , at the age of 100 , he was the oldest federal inmate in the United States and the only centenarian in federal custody .",
  "/wiki/Underboss": "Underboss ( Italian : sottocapo ) is a position within the leadership structure of certain organized crime groups , particularly in Sicilian , Greek , and Italian-American Mafia crime families . The underboss is second in command to the boss . The underboss is sometimes a family member , such as a son , who will take over the family if the boss is sick , killed , or imprisoned . However the position of street boss has somewhat challenged the rank of underboss in the modern era . The position was installed within the Genovese crime family since at least the mid 1960s . It has also been used in the Detroit crime family and the Chicago Outfit . The power of an underboss greatly varies ; some are marginal figures , while others are the most powerful individuals in the family . Traditionally they run day-to-day affairs of the family . In some crime families , the appointment is for life . If a new boss takes over a family with an existing underboss , that boss may marginalize or even murder the underboss appointed by his predecessor . On the other hand , if a boss is incarcerated , the underboss may become acting boss . As bosses often serve large periods of time in prison , an acting boss will often become the crime family 's effective boss .",
  "/wiki/Colombo_crime_family": "The Colombo crime family ( pronounced [ ko\u02c8lombo ] ) is the youngest of the Five Families that dominates organized crime activities in New York City , United States , within the nationwide criminal organization known as the American Mafia . It was during Lucky Luciano 's organization of the American Mafia after the Castellammarese War , and the assassinations of Giuseppe Joe The Boss Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano , that the gang run by Joseph Profaci was recognized as the Profaci crime family . The family traces its roots to a bootlegging gang formed by Joseph Profaci in 1928 . Profaci would rule his family without interruption or challenge until the late 1950s . The family has been torn by three internal wars . The first war took place during the late 1950s when capo Joe Gallo revolted against Profaci , but it lost momentum in the early 1960s when Gallo was arrested and Profaci died of cancer . The family was not reunited until the early 1960s under Joseph Colombo . In 1971 , the second family war began after Gallo 's release from prison and the shooting of Colombo . Colombo supporters led by Carmine Persico won the second war after the exiling of the remaining Gallo crew to the Genovese family in 1975 . The family would then enjoy over 15 years of peace under Persico and his string of acting bosses . In 1991 , the third and bloodiest war erupted when acting boss Victor Orena tried to seize power from the imprisoned Carmine Persico . The family split into factions loyal to Orena and Persico , and two years of mayhem ensued .",
  "/wiki/Racketeering": "A racket , according to the current common and most general definition , is an organized criminal act in which the criminal act is some form of substantial business , or a way to earn illegal money either regularly , or briefly but repeatedly . A racket is therefore generally a repeated or continuous organized criminal operation . However , according to the more specific definition , racketeering constitutes extortion or criminal coercion . Originally and often still specifically , a racket referred to a criminal act in which the perpetrator or perpetrators fraudulently offer a service that will not be put into effect , a service to solve a nonexistent problem , or to solve a problem that would not exist without the racket . Conducting a racket is racketeering . Particularly , the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it , but that fact may be concealed , with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party . The most common example of a racket is the protection racket , which promises to protect the target business or person from dangerous individuals in the neighborhood and then either collects the money or causes damage to the business until the owner pays . The racket exists as both the problem and its solution , and it is used as a method of extortion . However , the term racket has expanded in definition and may now be used less strictly to refer to any continuous or repeated illegal organized crime operation , including those that do not necessarily involve fraudulent practices . For example , racket may be used to refer to the numbers racket or the drug racket , neither of which generally involve fraud or deception with regard to the intended clientele . Racketeering is most often associated with organized crime , and the term was coined by the Employers ' Association of Chicago in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the Teamsters union .",
  "/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)": "In criminal law , a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime at some time in the future . Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement , to constitute an offense . There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and , in most countries , no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect ( compare attempts which require proximity to the full offense ) . For the purposes of concurrence , the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or can not be traced . Finally , repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability ( unless , in some cases , it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts ) but may reduce their sentence . An unindicted co-conspirator , or unindicted conspirator , is a person or entity that is alleged in an indictment to have engaged in conspiracy , but who is not charged in the same indictment . Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity , pragmatic considerations , and evidentiary concerns .",

  "/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombing": "During the annual Boston Marathon on April 15 , 2013 , two homemade pressure cooker bombs detonated 14 seconds and 210 yards ( 190 m ) apart at 2:49 p.m. , near the finish line of the race , killing 3 people and injuring several hundred others , including 16 who lost limbs . Three days later , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) released images of two suspects , who were later identified as Chechen Kyrgyzstani-American brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev . They killed an MIT policeman , kidnapped a man in his car , and had a shootout with the police in nearby Watertown , during which two officers were severely injured , one of whom died a year later . Tamerlan was shot several times , and his brother Dzhokhar ran him over while escaping in the stolen car ; Tamerlan died soon after . An unprecedented manhunt for Dzhokhar ensued on April 19 , with thousands of law enforcement officers searching a 20-block area of Watertown ; residents of Watertown and surrounding communities were asked to stay indoors , and the transportation system and most businesses and public places closed . Around 6:00 p.m. , a Watertown resident discovered Dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his backyard . He was shot and wounded by police before being taken into custody . During questioning , Dzhokhar said that he and his brother were motivated by extremist Islamist beliefs and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups , and that he was following his brother 's lead . He said they learned to build explosive devices from the online magazine of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . He also said they had intended to travel to New York City to bomb Times Square .

  "/wiki/Crime_boss": "A crime boss , crime lord , don , gang boss , kingpin , mafia boss , criminal mastermind or mob boss is a person in charge of a criminal organization . A boss typically has absolute or nearly absolute control over the other members of the organization , is greatly feared for their ruthlessness and willingness to take lives to exert their influence , and profits from the criminal endeavors in which the organization engages . Some groups may only have as little as two ranks ( a boss and their soldiers ) . Other groups have a more complex , structured organization with many ranks , and structure may vary with cultural background . Organized crime enterprises originating in Sicily differ in structure from those in mainland Italy . American groups may be structured differently from their European counterparts , and Latino and African American gangs often have structures that vary from European gangs . The size of the criminal organization is also important , as regional or national gangs have much more complex hierarchies .",

  "/wiki/Extortion": "Extortion ( also called shakedown , and , in a legal sense incorrectly , exaction ) is obtaining benefit through coercion . In most jurisdictions it is likely to constitute a criminal offense ; the bulk of this article deals with such cases . Extortion is sometimes called the protection racket since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for protection from ( real or hypothetical ) threats from unspecified other parties ; though often , and almost always , such protection is simply abstinence of harm from the same party , and such is implied in the protection offer . Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime . In some jurisdictions , actually obtaining the benefit is not required to commit the offense , and making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense . Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force , but additionally , in its formal definition , means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant . The term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to price-gouging , though neither is legally considered extortion . It is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against their will , to another , in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences . Neither extortion nor blackmail requires a threat of a criminal act , such as violence , merely a threat used to elicit actions , money , or property from the object of the extortion . Such threats include the filing of reports ( true or not ) of criminal behavior to the police , revelation of damaging facts ( such as pictures of the object of the extortion in a compromising position ) , etc . In law extortion can refer to political corruption , such as selling one 's office or influence peddling , [ citation needed ] but in general vocabulary the word usually first brings to mind blackmail or protection rackets . The logical connection between the corruption sense of the word and the other senses is that to demand bribes in one 's official capacity is blackmail or racketeering in essence ( that is , you need access to this resource , the government restricts access to it through my office , and I will charge you unfairly and unlawfully for such access ) .",

  "/wiki/Insanity_defense": "The insanity defense , also known as the mental disorder defense , is an affirmative defense by excuse in a criminal case , arguing that the defendant is not responsible for his or her actions due to an episodic or persistent psychiatric disease at the time of the criminal act . This is contrasted with an excuse of provocation , in which the defendant is responsible , but the responsibility is lessened due to a temporary mental state . :613 It is also contrasted with a finding that a defendant can not stand trial in a criminal case because a mental disease prevents them from effectively assisting counsel , from a civil finding in trusts and estates where a will is nullified because it was made when a mental disorder prevented a testator from recognizing the natural objects of their bounty , and from involuntary civil commitment to a mental institution , when anyone is found to be gravely disabled or to be a danger to themselves or to others . :613 Exemption from full criminal punishment on such grounds dates back to at least the Code of Hammurabi . Legal definitions of insanity or mental disorder are varied , and include the M'Naghten Rule , the Durham rule , the 1953 British Royal Commission on Capital Punishment report , the ALI rule ( American Legal Institute Model Penal Code rule ) , and other provisions , often relating to a lack of mens rea ( guilty mind ) . :613-635 In the criminal laws of Australia and Canada , statutory legislation enshrines the M'Naghten Rules , with the terms defense of mental disorder , defense of mental illness or not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder employed . Being incapable of distinguishing right from wrong is one basis for being found to be legally insane as a criminal defense . It originated in the M'Naghten Rule , and has been reinterpreted and modernized through more recent cases , such as People v. Serravo . :615-625 In the United Kingdom , Ireland , and the United States , use of the defense is rare ; however , since the Criminal Procedure ( Insanity and Unfitness to Plead ) Act 1991 , insanity pleas have steadily increased in the UK . Mitigating factors , including things not eligible for the insanity defense such as intoxication ( or , more frequently , diminished capacity ) , may lead to reduced charges or reduced sentences . The defense is based on evaluations by forensic mental health professionals with the appropriate test according to the jurisdiction .",

Any act of worship that follows the Islamic rules of prayer can be said to create a mosque , whether or not it takes place in a special building . Informal and open-air places of worship are called musalla , while mosques used for communal prayer on Fridays are known as j\u0101mi\u02bf . Mosque buildings typically contain an ornamental niche ( mihrab ) set into the wall that indicates the direction of Mecca ( qiblah ) , ablution facilities and minarets from which calls to prayer are issued . The pulpit ( minbar ) , from which the Friday ( jumu'ah ) sermon ( khutba ) is delivered , was in earlier times characteristic of the central city mosque , but has since become common in smaller mosques . Mosques typically have segregated spaces for men and women . This basic pattern of organization has assumed different forms depending on the region , period and denomination . Mosques commonly serve as locations for prayer , Ramadan vigils , funeral services , Sufi ceremonies , marriage and business agreements , alms collection and distribution , as well as homeless shelters . Historically , mosques were also important centers of elementary education and advanced training in religious sciences . In modern times , they have preserved their role as places of religious instruction and debate , but higher learning now generally takes place in specialised institutions . Special importance is accorded to the Great Mosque of Mecca ( centre of the hajj ) , the Prophet 's Mosque in Medina ( burial place of Muhammad ) and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem ( believed to be the site of Muhammad 's ascent to heaven ) . In the past , many mosques in the Muslim world were built over burial places of Sufi saints and other venerated figures , which has turned them into popular pilgrimage destinations .",

  "/wiki/Bribery": "Bribery is defined by Black 's Law Dictionary as the offering , giving , receiving , or soliciting of any item of value to influence the actions of an official , or other person , in charge of a public or legal duty . With regard to governmental operations , essentially , bribery is Corrupt solicitation , acceptance , or transfer of value in exchange for official action . Gifts of money or other items of value which are otherwise available to everyone on an equivalent basis , and not for dishonest purposes , is not bribery . Offering a discount or a refund to all purchasers is a legal rebate and is not bribery . For example , it is legal for an employee of a Public Utilities Commission involved in electric rate regulation to accept a rebate on electric service that reduces their cost for electricity , when the rebate is available to other residential electric customers . However , giving a discount specifically to that employee to influence them to look favorably on the electric utility 's rate increase applications would be considered bribery . A bribe is an illegal or unethical gift bestowed to influence the recipient 's conduct .
