A testamentary trust is created by a will and arises after the death of the settlor . An inter vivos trust is created during the settlor 's lifetime by a trust instrument . A trust may be revocable or irrevocable ; in the United States , a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable , except in California , Oklahoma and Texas , in which trusts are presumed to be revocable until the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable . An irrevocable trust can be broken ( revoked ) only by a judicial proceeding . The trustee is the legal owner of the property in trust , as fiduciary for the beneficiary or beneficiaries who is/are the equitable owner ( s ) of the trust property . Trustees thus have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust to the benefit of the equitable owners . They must provide a regular accounting of trust income and expenditures . Trustees may be compensated and be reimbursed their expenses . A court of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches his/her fiduciary duty . Some breaches of fiduciary duty can be charged and tried as criminal offences in a court of law . A trustee can be a natural person , a business entity or a public body .",
