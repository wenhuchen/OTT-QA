  "/wiki/Eastern_Europe": "Eastern Europe is the eastern part of the European continent . There is no consistent definition of the precise area it covers , partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical , geographical , cultural , and socioeconomic connotations . There are almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region . A related United Nations paper adds that every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct . One definition describes Eastern Europe as a cultural entity : the region lying in Europe with the main characteristics consisting of Greek , Byzantine , Eastern Orthodox , Russian , and some Ottoman cultural influences . Another definition was created during the Cold War and used more or less synonymously with the term Eastern Bloc . A similar definition names the formerly communist European states outside the Soviet Union as Eastern Europe . Most historians and social scientists view such definitions as outdated or relegated , but they are still sometimes used for statistical purposes .",

  "/wiki/Bagel": "A bagel ( Yiddish : \u05d1\u05f2\u05d2\u05dc beygl ; Polish : bajgiel ) , also historically spelled beigel , is a bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland . It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough , roughly hand-sized , that is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked . The result is a dense , chewy , doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior . Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust , with the traditional ones being poppy or sesame seeds . Some may have salt sprinkled on their surface , and there are different dough types , such as whole-grain or rye . Bagels are eaten toasted or untoasted . Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure , it is known that they were widely consumed by Ashkenazi Jews from the 17th century . The first known mention of the bagel , in 1610 , was in Jewish community ordinances in Krak\u00f3w , Poland . Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America , especially in cities with a large Jewish population , many with alternative ways of making them . Like other bakery products , bagels are available ( fresh or frozen , often in many flavors ) in many major supermarkets in those cities . The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing more even cooking and baking of the dough : The hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels , allowing easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays .",

Poland is bordered by the Baltic Sea , Lithuania , and Russia 's Kaliningrad Oblast to the north , Belarus and Ukraine to the east , Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south , and Germany to the west . The history of human activity on Polish soil spans almost 500,000 years . Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse , with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain . However , it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name . The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966 , when Mieszko I , ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland , converted to Christianity . The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest ( over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles ) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe , with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe 's first written national constitution , the Constitution of 3 May 1791 .",

In English , the word borscht is most often associated with the soup 's variant of Ukrainian origin , one of the most famous dishes of Ukrainian cuisine , made with beetroots as one of the main ingredients , which give the dish its distinctive red color . The same name , however , is also used for a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots , such as sorrel-based green borscht , rye-based white borscht and cabbage borscht . Borscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems , leaves and umbels of common hogweed ( Heracleum sphondylium ) , a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows , which lent the dish its Slavic name . With time , it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups , among which the beet-based red borscht has become the most popular . It is typically made by combining meat or bone stock with saut\u00e9ed vegetables , which - as well as beetroots - usually include cabbage , carrots , onions , potatoes and tomatoes . Depending on the recipe , borscht may include meat or fish , or be purely vegetarian ; it may be served either hot or cold ; and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a clear broth or a smooth drink . It is often served with smetana or sour cream , hard-boiled eggs or potatoes , but there exists an ample choice of more involved garnishes and side dishes , such as uszka or pampushky , that can be served with the soup . Its popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and the former Russian Empire , and - by way of migration - to other continents . In North America , borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites , the groups who first brought it there from Europe . Several ethnic groups claim borscht , in its various local guises , as their own national dish consumed as part of ritual meals within Eastern Orthodox , Greek Catholic , Roman Catholic , and Jewish religious traditions .",

Together with Shavuot and Sukkot , Passover was one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals ( Shalosh Regalim ) during which the entire population of the kingdom of Judah made a pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem . Samaritans still make this pilgrimage to Mount Gerizim , but only men participate in public worship . During the existence of the Temple in Jerusalem , Passover was a spring festival that was connected to the offering of the first-fruits of the barley , as barley was the first grain to ripen and to be harvested in the Land of Israel . The festivals now associated with the Exodus ( Passover , Shavuot , and Sukkot ) began as agricultural and seasonal feasts but became completely subsumed into the central narrative of Israel 's deliverance from oppression at the hands of God . In the Book of Exodus , God helped the Israelites escape from slavery in ancient Egypt by inflicting ten plagues upon the Egyptians before the Pharaoh would release the Israelite slaves . The last of the plagues was the death of the Egyptian first-born . The Israelites were instructed to mark the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a slaughtered spring lamb and , upon seeing this , the spirit of the Lord knew to pass over the first-born in these homes , hence the English name of the holiday . Passover commences on the 15th of the Hebrew month of Nisan and lasts for either seven days ( in Israel and for Reform Jews and other progressive Jews around the world who adhere to the biblical commandment ) or eight days for Orthodox , Hasidic , and most Conservative Jews ( in the diaspora ) . The rituals unique to the Passover celebrations commence with the Passover Seder when the 15th of Nisan has begun .",

The English word chrain comes from Yiddish \u05db\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05df , which is in turn a loanword from Slavic languages . There are two common forms of chrain in the Jewish and Slavic cuisines . White chrain consists of grated horseradish and vinegar , and sometimes sugar and salt , while red chrain includes the addition of beetroot . These types of chrain are distinct from other horseradish-based condiments in that they are pareve ( contain no dairy products ) , making it acceptable at both meat and dairy meals according to Jewish dietary law . In contrast , many Central European varieties include cream , while some Russian recipes call for chrain with smetana ( sour cream ) . There are also varieties including apples , lingonberry , cranberry and oranges . The use of chrain in Eastern European Jewish communities is ancient , and is first attested in writing from the 12th century . Though it has had several historical uses , chrain is most commonly associated in modern times with gefilte fish , for which it is considered an essential condiment .

According to the Shulchan Aruch ( Yoreh De'ah 87:5 ) , unhatched eggs are pareve only if fully formed , while unhatched eggs that are not fully formed are considered fleishig and may not be consumed with dairy products . However , dairy products can be consumed after eating partially formed eggs .",
