  "/wiki/AAR_wheel_arrangement": "The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive ( or unit ) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads . It is essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification , and it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives . It is not used for steam locomotives which use the Whyte notation instead . The AAR system counts axles instead of wheels . Letters refer to powered axles , and numbers to unpowered ( or idler ) axles . A refers to one powered axle , B to two powered axles in a row , C to three powered axles in a row , and D to four powered axles in a row . 1 refers to one idler axle , and 2 to two idler axles in a row . A dash ( - ) separates trucks , or wheel assemblies . A plus sign ( + ) refers to articulation , either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers .",
  "/wiki/Prime_mover_(locomotive)": "In engineering , a prime mover is an engine that converts fuel to useful work . In locomotives , the prime mover is thus the source of power for its propulsion . In an engine-generator set , the engine is the prime mover , as distinct from the generator .",
  "/wiki/Horsepower": "Horsepower ( hp ) is a unit of measurement of power , or the rate at which work is done , usually in reference to the output of engines or motors . There are many different standards and types of horsepower . Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower ( or imperial horsepower ) , which is about 745.7 watts , and the metric horsepower , which is approximately 735.5 watts . The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses . It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines , as well as turbines , electric motors and other machinery . The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions . Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power . With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1 , 2010 , the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit .",
  "/wiki/EMD_FT": "The EMD FT is a 1,350-horsepower ( 1,010 kW ) diesel-electric locomotive that was produced between March 1939 and November 1945 , by General Motors ' Electro-Motive Corporation ( EMC ) , later known as GM Electro-Motive Division ( EMD ) . The F stood for Fourteen Hundred ( 1400 ) horsepower ( rounded from 1350 ) and the T for Twin , as it came standard in a two-unit set . The design was developed from the TA model built for the C , RI & P in 1937 , and was similar in cylinder count , axle count , length and layout . All told 555 cab-equipped A units were built , along with 541 cabless booster or B units , for a grand total of 1,096 units . The locomotives were all sold to customers in the United States . It was the first model in EMD 's very successful F-unit series of cab unit freight diesels , and was the locomotive that convinced many U.S. railroads that the diesel-electric freight locomotive was the future . Many rail historians consider the FT one of the most important locomotive models of all time . The first units produced for a customer were built in December 1940 and January 1941 for the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and numbered the 100 set . These were the first diesel-electric locomotives ever produced with dynamic braking , a system developed at the insistence of the railroad and with its assistance . Initially the four-unit , coupler-equipped set featured two booster units between two cab units in the manner of the demonstrator set . The Brotherhoods of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen , however , insisted that the two cabs required two crews , so the railway had EMD produce extra boosters , and renumbered its earliest sets into four unit sets with one cab unit and three boosters . Negotiation with the unions soon rectified the situation , but as the road 's earliest units were geared for higher speeds than subsequent units , these sets continued to be composed of one FTA cab unit and three FTB boosters .",
  "/wiki/EMD_567": "The EMD 567 is a line of large medium-speed diesel engines built by General Motors ' Electro-Motive Division . This engine , which succeeded Winton 's 201A , was used in EMD 's locomotives from 1938 until its replacement in 1966 by the EMD 645 . It has a bore of 8 1\u20442 in ( 216 mm ) , a stroke of 10 in ( 254 mm ) and a displacement of 567 cu in ( 9.29 L ) per cylinder . Like the Winton 201A , the EMD 645 and the EMD 710 , the EMD 567 is a two-stroke engine . EMD 's chief competitor , GE , now makes EMD-compatible replacement parts .",
  "/wiki/EMD_F2": "The EMD F2 was a freight-hauling diesel locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between July 1946 and November 1946 . It succeeded the FT model in GM-EMD 's F-unit sequence , and was replaced in turn by the F3 . The F2 was in many respects a transitional type between those two ; it kept the 1,350 hp ( 1,010 kW ) rated D8 generator from the FT due to late development of the new D12 generator intended for the F3 , but in a revised carbody design and internal layout that would be continued through the rest of the F-unit series . 74 cab-equipped lead A units and 30 cabless booster B units were produced . There are no reliable recognition features for an F2 . They were built with what has become known as 'Type 1 ' side panels , with three portholes and no filter grilles , but this was carried over into early F3 production and in any case could be changed later by the customer . Like most F3s , they were built with small side numberboards . They , and all subsequent F-units , are readily distinguished from the FT by having two exhaust stacks instead of four , and by having no large overhang on the end of the B units , while the trucks were a little further away from the other ends . They also had four radiator fans at the center of the unit next to each other in line on the roof instead of two at each end . This external feature was the result of a major change in internal arrangement , the replacement of all mechanical and belt-drives for radiator fans and traction motor blowers with electric motors . Power for these accessories was produced by a new D14 three phase alternator built into the main DC generator , called a companion alternator . This device has been used in all later EMD road locomotives to the present .",
  "/wiki/EMD_F3": "The EMD F3 is a 1,500-horsepower ( 1,100 kW ) B-B freight- and passenger-hauling diesel locomotive produced between July 1945 and February 1949 by General Motors Electro-Motive Division . Final assembly was at GM-EMD 's La Grange , Illinois plant . A total of 1,111 cab-equipped lead A units and 696 cabless booster B units were built . The F3 was the third model in GM-EMD 's highly successful F-unit series of cab unit diesel locomotives , and it was the second most produced of the series . The F3 essentially differed from the EMD F2 in that it used the new D12 generator to produce more power and from the later EMD F7 in electrical equipment . Some late-model F3 's had the same D27 traction motors , along with the heavier-duty electrical cables , used in the F7 , and were referred to as model F5 by EMD 's Engineering Department .",

Final assembly was at GM-EMD 's La Grange , Illinois plant , excepting locomotives destined for Canada , in which case final assembly was at GMD 's plant in London , Ontario . The FP7 was essentially EMD 's F7A locomotive extended by four feet to give greater water capacity for the steam generator for heating passenger trains .",
  "/wiki/A_unit": "An A unit , in railroad terminology , is a diesel locomotive ( or more rarely an electric locomotive ) equipped with a driving cab and a control system to control other locomotives in a multiple unit , and therefore able to be the lead unit in a consist of several locomotives controlled from a single position . This terminology is generally used in North America , since only there was it commonplace to build B units - cabless locomotive units which normally could not lead a train .",
  "/wiki/B_unit": "A B unit , in railroad terminology , is a locomotive unit ( generally a diesel locomotive ) which does not have a control cab or crew compartment , and must therefore be operated in tandem with another coupled locomotive with a cab ( an A unit ) . The terms booster unit and cabless are also used . The concept is largely confined to North America . Elsewhere , locomotives without driving cabs are rare .",
  "/wiki/Watt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",
  "/wiki/EMD_F9": "The EMD F9 is a 1,750 horsepower ( 1,300 kW ) Diesel-electric locomotive produced between February 1953 and May 1960 by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors ( EMD ) and General Motors Diesel ( GMD ) . It succeeded the F7 model in GM-EMD 's F-unit sequence . Final assembly was at GM-EMD 's La Grange , Illinois plant . The F9 was also built in Canada by General Motors Diesel at their London , Ontario plant . A total of 101 cab-equipped lead A units and 156 cabless booster B units were built . The F9 was the fifth model in GM-EMD 's highly successful F series of cab unit diesel locomotives . A F9 can be distinguished reliably from a late F7 only by the addition of an extra filter grille ahead of the front porthole on the side panels on A units . Internally , the use of an 567C prime mover increased power to 1,750 hp ( 1.30 MW ) from the F7 's 1,500 hp ( 1.12 MW ) . By the time cab units such as the F9 were built , railroads were turning to the road switcher-style of locomotive , and the F9 was succeeded in most part by the EMD GP9 .",
  "/wiki/EMD_FP9": "The EMD FP9 is a 1,750 horsepower ( 1,300 kW ) , B-B dual-service passenger and freight-hauling diesel locomotive that was produced between February 1954 and December 1959 by General Motors Electro-Motive Division , and General Motors Diesel . Final assembly was at GM-EMD 's La Grange , Illinois plant , except for Canadian orders , which were assembled by Canadian subsidiary GMD at London , Ontario . The FP9 was essentially EMD 's F9 locomotive extended by four feet to give greater steam generator and water capacity for hauling passenger trains . A total of 90 cab-equipped lead A units were built ; unlike the freight series , no cabless booster B units were sold . Regular F9B units were sometimes used with FP9 A units , since they , lacking cabs , had more room for water and steam generators . The FP9 and its predecessor , the FP7 , were offshoots of GM-EMD 's highly successful F-unit series of cab unit diesel locomotives .",
