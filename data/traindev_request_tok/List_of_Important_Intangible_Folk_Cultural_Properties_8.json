It has been celebrated in Japan for more than 500 years and traditionally includes a dance , known as Bon Odori . The festival of Obon lasts for three days ; however , its starting date varies within different regions of Japan . When the lunar calendar was changed to the Gregorian calendar at the beginning of the Meiji era , the localities in Japan responded differently , which resulted in three different times of Obon . Shichigatsu Bon ( Bon in July ) is based on the solar calendar and is celebrated around the 15th of July in eastern Japan ( Kant\u014d region such as Tokyo , Yokohama and the T\u014dhoku region ) , coinciding with Ch\u016bgen . Hachigatsu Bon ( Bon in August ) , based on the lunar calendar , is celebrated around the August 15 and is the most commonly celebrated time . Ky\u016b Bon ( Old Bon ) is celebrated on the 15th day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar , and so differs each year , which appears between August 8 and September 7 . One exception was in 2008 and 2019 , when the solar and lunar calendar matched so Hachigatsu Bon and Ky\u016b Bon were celebrated on the same day .

To his right is the \u014dtsuzumi hip drum , followed by the kotsuzumi shoulder drum , and the Noh flute ( n\u014dkan or simply fue ) . In kabuki , a number of shamisen players are added , along with , depending on the play , taiko drums of various sizes , various types of flutes , and other instruments , including a myriad of devices for sound effects . The kabuki hayashi is generally located in a small room just off-stage , and is not visible to the audience , though a barred window in the walls of the stage set indicates its location .

  "/wiki/Shinto": "Shinto , [ a ] also known as Shintoism or kami-no-michi , [ b ] is a religion originating from Japan . Classified as an East Asian religion by scholars of religion , its practitioners often regard it as Japan 's indigenous religion . Scholars sometimes call its practitioners Shintoists , although adherents rarely use that term themselves . Shinto is polytheistic and revolves around the kami ( gods or spirits ) , supernatural entities believed to inhabit all things . The link between the kami and the natural world has led to Shinto being considered animistic and pantheistic . The kami are worshiped at kamidana household shrines , family shrines , and public shrines . The latter are staffed by priests who oversee offerings to the kami and the provision of religious paraphernalia such as amulets to the religion 's adherents . Other common rituals include the kagura ritual dances , age specific celebrations , and seasonal festivals . These festivals and rituals are collectively called matsuri . A major conceptual focus in Shinto is ensuring purity by cleansing practices of various types including ritual washing or bathing . Shinto does not emphasize specific moral codes other than ritual purity , reverence for kami , and regular communion following seasonal practices . Shinto has no single creator or specific doctrinal text , but exists in a diverse range of localized and regionalised forms .",

Although deity is the common interpretation of kami , some Shinto scholars argue that such a translation can cause a misunderstanding of the term . [ page needed ] The wide variety of usage of the word kami can be compared to the Sanskrit Deva and the Hebrew Elohim , which also refer to God , gods , angels , or spirits . The etymological origin of the word kami is from proto-Japonic kamugami ( \u201e to shine ( into the eye ) ) or kagami ( \u201e mirror ) , and was used to describe the characteristics of the kami .
