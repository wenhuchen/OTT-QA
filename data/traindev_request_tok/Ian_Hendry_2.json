Caine became a co-producer of the film . Get Carter was Hodges 's first feature film as director , as well as being the screen debut of Alun Armstrong . MGM was reducing its European operations and the film became the last project approved before it closed its Borehamwood studios . The film is set in north-east England and was filmed in and around Newcastle upon Tyne , Gateshead and County Durham . The story follows a London gangster , the eponymous Jack Carter ( Caine ) , who travels back to his home town to discover more about his brother Frank 's supposedly accidental death . Suspecting foul play , he investigates and interrogates , regaining a feel for the city and its hardened-criminal element ; with vengeance on his mind , the situation builds to a violent conclusion . Caine and Hodges had ambitions to produce a more gritty and realistic portrayal of violence and criminal behaviour than had previously been seen in a British film . Caine incorporated his knowledge of real criminal acquaintances into his characterisation of Carter .
