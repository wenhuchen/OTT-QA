There was also ferry service on Lake Washington from the early 1880s to August 31 , 1950 from Madison Park across the lake to Kirkland . ( The construction of the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge in 1940 had greatly reduced demand and the continued existence of the run could no longer be justified after tolls were removed in 1949 . )",

The team was disbanded after their first season , with McCredie selling several players to the Beavers . McCredie originally said he did not want to run two teams , but changed his mind in 1911 when he placed a bid for a Northwestern League franchise .

  "/wiki/Seattle_Pilots": "The Seattle Pilots were an American professional baseball team based in Seattle , Washington during the 1969 Major League Baseball season . During their single-season existence , the Pilots played their home games at Sick 's Stadium and were a member of the West Division of Major League Baseball 's American League . On April 1 , 1970 , the franchise moved to Milwaukee , Wisconsin and became the Milwaukee Brewers . The Pilots name originated from the owner 's part-time job as a harbor pilot and the city 's association with the aviation industry . The team colors were royal blue and gold ( with accessory red in the logo : helm and baseball seams ) . Seattle had long been a hotbed for minor league baseball and was home to the Seattle Rainiers , a successful team in the Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) . At the time , Seattle was the third-biggest metropolitan area on the West Coast . The Cleveland Indians briefly considered a move to Seattle in 1964 but opted to stay in Ohio . In 1967 Charles Finley looked to move his Kansas City Athletics to Seattle , but ended up moving the Athletics to Oakland , California . There was no real competition from other professional teams at the time . While Seattle had landed the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) 's SuperSonics in 1967 , the NBA was not as popular as baseball was at the time . The NFL would come to the city in 1976 with the addition of the expansion Seahawks .",

  "/wiki/Kingdome": "The Kingdome ( officially the King County Multipurpose Domed Stadium ) was a multi-purpose stadium in Seattle 's SoDo neighborhood . Owned and operated by King County , the Kingdome opened in 1976 and was best known as the home stadium of the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League ( NFL ) , the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , and the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . The stadium also served as both the home outdoor and indoor venue for the Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League ( NASL ) and hosted numerous amateur sporting events , concerts , and other events . The Kingdome measured 660 feet ( 200 m ) wide from its inside walls . The idea of constructing a covered stadium for a major league football or baseball team was first proposed to Seattle officials in 1959 . Voters rejected separate measures to approve public funding for such a stadium in 1960 and 1966 , but the outcome was different in 1968 ; King County voters approved the issue of US $ 40 million in municipal bonds to construct the stadium . Construction began in 1972 and the stadium opened in 1976 as the home stadium of the Sounders and Seahawks . The Mariners moved in the following year , and the SuperSonics moved in the next year , only to move back to the Seattle Center Coliseum in 1985 . The stadium hosted several major sports events , including the Soccer Bowl in August 1976 , the Pro Bowl in January 1977 , the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in July 1979 , the NBA All-Star Game in 1987 , and the NCAA Final Four in 1984 , 1989 , and 1995 . During the 1990s , the Seahawks ' and Mariners ' respective ownership groups began to question the suitability of the Kingdome as a venue for each team , threatening to relocate unless new , publicly funded stadiums were built . At issue was the fact that neither team saw their shared tenancy as profitable , as well as the integrity of the stadium 's roof as highlighted by the collapse of ceiling tiles onto the seating area before a scheduled Mariners game . As a result , public funding packages for new , purpose-built stadiums for the Mariners and Seahawks were approved in 1995 and 1997 , respectively .",
  "/wiki/Seattle_Mariners": "The Seattle Mariners are an American professional baseball team based in Seattle , Washington . They compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the American League ( AL ) West division . The team joined the American League as an expansion team in 1977 playing their home games in the Kingdome . Since July 1999 , the Mariners ' home ballpark has been T-Mobile Park ( formerly Safeco Field ) , located in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle . The Mariners name originates from the prominence of marine culture in the city of Seattle . They are nicknamed the M 's , a title featured in their primary logo from 1987 to 1992 . They adopted their current team colors - navy blue , northwest green ( teal ) , and silver - prior to the 1993 season , after having been royal blue and gold since the team 's inception . Their mascot is the Mariner Moose . The organization did not field a winning team until 1991 , and any real success eluded them until 1995 when they won their first division championship and defeated the New York Yankees in the ALDS . The game-winning hit in Game 5 , in which Edgar Mart\u00ednez drove home Ken Griffey Jr. to win the game in the 11th inning , clinched a series win for the Mariners , served as a powerful impetus to preserve baseball in Seattle , and has since become an iconic moment in team history . The Mariners won 116 games in 2001 , which set the American League record for most wins in a single season and tied the 1906 Chicago Cubs for the Major League record for most wins in a single season . Through the end of the 2019 season , the franchise has finished with a losing record in 29 of 43 seasons .",

It is located in Seattle 's SoDo neighborhood , near the western terminus of Interstate 90 . The first game was played on July 15 , 1999 . During the 1990s , the suitability of the Mariners ' original stadium - the Kingdome - as an MLB facility came under doubt , and the team 's ownership group threatened to relocate the team . In September 1995 , King County voters defeated a ballot measure to secure public funding for a new baseball stadium . Shortly thereafter , the Mariners ' first appearance in the MLB postseason and their victory in the 1995 American League Division Series ( ALDS ) renewed a public desire to keep the team in Seattle . As a result , the Washington State Legislature approved an alternate means of funding for the stadium with public money . The site for the stadium , just south of the Kingdome , was selected in September 1996 and construction began in March 1997 . The bonds issued to finance Safeco Field were retired on October 1 , 2011 , five years earlier than anticipated . Aside from professional baseball , T-Mobile Park is also used for amateur baseball events including the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association high school state championships and one Washington Huskies game per season . Major non-baseball events that have been held at T-Mobile Park include the 2001 Seattle Bowl , as well as WrestleMania XIX in 2003 which attracted the stadium 's record attendance of 54,097 ."
