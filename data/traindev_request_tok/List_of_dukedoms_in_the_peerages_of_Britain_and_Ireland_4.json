The title was not awarded for over 150 years : the next to receive the dukedom was the son of King Charles I , Henry Stuart , upon whose death the title again became extinct . Prince William , son of the future Queen Anne , was styled Duke of Gloucester for his whole life ( 1689-1700 ) , but was never formally created duke . Frederick , Prince of Wales , was styled Duke of Gloucester from 1718-1726 , but was then created Duke of Edinburgh rather than of Gloucester . There was next a creation of a double dukedom ( not two dukedoms ) for the brother of King George III , Prince William Henry , his proper title becoming Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh . The fifth and most recent creation was for the Prince Henry , son of King George V. Upon Prince Henry 's death , the dukedom was inherited by his son Prince Richard , who still holds the title .",

While big-game shooting in Kenya , he met the future aviator Beryl Markham , with whom he became romantically involved . The court put pressure on him to end the relationship , but he had to pay regular hush-money to avert a public scandal . In 1935 , also under parental pressure , he married Lady Alice Montagu Douglas Scott , with whom he had two sons , Princes William and Richard . From 1939 to 1940 , Henry served in France as a liaison officer to Lord Gort . He performed military and diplomatic duties during the rest of the war , then in 1945 was appointed as Australia 's governor-general at the request of Prime Minister John Curtin .
