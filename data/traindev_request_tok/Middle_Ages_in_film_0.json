  "/wiki/The_Passion_of_Joan_of_Arc": "The Passion of Joan of Arc ( French : La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc ) is a 1928 silent French historical film based on the actual record of the trial of Joan of Arc . The film was directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer and stars Ren\u00e9e Jeanne Falconetti as Joan . It is widely regarded as a landmark of cinema , especially for its production , Dreyer 's direction and Falconetti 's performance , which is often listed as one of the finest in cinema history . The film summarizes the time that Joan of Arc was a captive of England , depicting her trial and execution . Danish film director Dreyer was invited to make a film in France by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Films and chose to make a film about Joan of Arc due to her renewed popularity in France . Dreyer spent over a year researching Joan of Arc and the transcripts of her trial before writing the script . Dreyer cast stage actress Falconetti as Joan in her only major film role . Falconetti 's performance and devotion to the role during filming have become legendary among film scholars . The film was shot on one huge concrete set modeled on medieval architecture in order to realistically portray the Rouen prison . The film is known for its cinematography and use of close-ups . Dreyer also did n't allow the actors to wear make-up and used lighting designs that made the actors look more grotesque . Prior to its release , the film was controversial due to French nationalists ' skepticism about whether a Danish person could direct a film that centered on one of France 's most revered historical icons .",
  "/wiki/Joan_of_Arc_in_art": ". Joan of Arc ( Jeanne d'Arc in French ) has inspired artistic and cultural works for nearly six centuries . The following lists cover various media to include items of historic interest , enduring works of high art , and recent representations in popular culture . The entries represent portrayals that a reader has a reasonable chance of encountering rather than a complete catalog . Lesser known works , particularly from early periods , are not included . In this article , many of the excluded items are derivative of better known representations . For instance , Schiller 's play inspired at least 82 different dramatic works during the nineteenth century , and Verdi 's and Tchaikovsky 's operatic adaptations are still recorded and performed . Most of the others survive only in research libraries . As another example , in 1894 , \u00c9mile Huet listed over 400 plays and musical works about Joan of Arc . Despite a great deal of scholarly interest in Joan of Arc no complete list of artistic works about her exists , although a 1989 doctoral dissertation did identify all relevant films including ones for which no copy survives . Portrayals of Joan of Arc are numerous . For example , in 1979 the Biblioth\u00e8que Municipale in Rouen , France displayed a gallery containing over 500 images and other items related to Joan of Arc .",

  "/wiki/John_of_England": "John ( 24 December 1166 - 19 October 1216 ) was King of England from 1199 until his death in 1216 . He was the third king of the House of Plantagenet . He lost the Duchy of Normandy and most of his other French lands to King Philip II of France , resulting in the collapse of the Angevin Empire and contributing to the subsequent growth in power of the French Capetian dynasty during the 13th century . The baronial revolt at the end of John 's reign led to the sealing of Magna Carta , a document sometimes considered an early step in the evolution of the constitution of the United Kingdom . John was the youngest of the four surviving sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine . He was nicknamed John Lackland because he was not expected to inherit significant lands . He became Henry 's favourite child following the failed revolt of 1173-74 by his brothers Henry the Young King , Richard , and Geoffrey against the King . John was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent . The war between Henry II and his eldest sons ended with the deaths of Henry the Young King and Geoffrey . John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against the royal administrators of his brother , King Richard , whilst Richard was participating in the Third Crusade , but he was proclaimed king after Richard died in 1199 . He came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John 's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200 . When war with France broke out again in 1202 , John achieved early victories , but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman , Breton , and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204 .",
  "/wiki/Norman_Conquest": "The Norman conquest of England ( in Britain , often called the Norman Conquest or the Conquest ) was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman , Breton , Flemish , and French soldiers led by the Duke of Normandy , later styled William the Conqueror . William 's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor , who may have encouraged William 's hopes for the throne . Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson . The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford , but Godwinson 's army defeated and killed Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September . Within days , William landed in southern England . Harold marched south to oppose him , leaving a significant portion of his army in the north . Harold 's army confronted William 's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings ; William 's force defeated Harold , who was killed in the engagement . Although William 's main rivals were gone , he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072 . The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated ; some of the elite fled into exile . To control his new kingdom , William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land with the Domesday Book , a manuscript record of the Great Survey of much of England and parts of Wales being completed by 1086 . Other effects of the conquest included the court and government , the introduction of the Norman language as the language of the elites , and changes in the composition of the upper classes , as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king . More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life : the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery , which may or may not have been linked to the invasion .",
  "/wiki/Anglo-Saxons": "The Anglo-Saxons were a cultural group who inhabited Great Britain from the 5th century . They comprise people from Germanic tribes who migrated to the island from continental Europe , their descendants , and indigenous British groups who adopted many aspects of Anglo-Saxon culture and language ; the cultural foundations laid by the Anglo-Saxons are the foundation of the modern English legal system and of many aspects of English society ; the modern English language owes over half its words - including the most common words of everyday speech - to the language of the Anglo-Saxons . Historically , the Anglo-Saxon period denotes the period in Britain between about 450 and 1066 , after their initial settlement and up until the Norman conquest . The early Anglo-Saxon period includes the creation of an English nation , with many of the aspects that survive today , including regional government of shires and hundreds . During this period , Christianity was established and there was a flowering of literature and language . Charters and law were also established . The term Anglo-Saxon is popularly used for the language that was spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons in England and eastern Scotland between at least the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century . In scholarly use , it is more commonly called Old English . The history of the Anglo-Saxons is the history of a cultural identity . It developed from divergent groups in association with the people 's adoption of Christianity , and was integral to the establishment of various kingdoms . Threatened by extended Danish invasions and military occupation of eastern England , this identity was re-established ; it dominated until after the Norman Conquest . The visible Anglo-Saxon culture can be seen in the material culture of buildings , dress styles , illuminated texts and grave goods .",

Richard was known as Richard C\u0153ur de Lion or Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior . He was also known in Occitan as : Oc e No ( English : Yes and No ) , because of his reputation for terseness . By the age of 16 , Richard had taken command of his own army , putting down rebellions in Poitou against his father . Richard was a central Christian commander during the Third Crusade , leading the campaign after the departure of Philip II of France and achieving considerable victories against his Muslim counterpart , Saladin , although he did not retake Jerusalem from Saladin . Richard spoke both French and Occitan . He was born in England , where he spent his childhood ; before becoming king , however , he lived most of his adult life in the Duchy of Aquitaine , in the southwest of France . Following his accession , he spent very little time , perhaps as little as six months , in England . Most of his life as king was spent on Crusade , in captivity , or actively defending his lands in France .",

  "/wiki/Crusade": "The crusades were a series of religious wars in Europe and western Asia initiated , supported and sometimes directed by the Catholic Church between the 11th and the 17th centuries . The crusades differed from other religious conflicts in that participants considered them a penitential exercise that brought absolution . Historians contest the definition of the term crusade with some restricting it to armed pilgrimages to Jerusalem ; others including all Catholic military campaigns with a promise of spiritual benefits ; all Catholic holy wars ; or those with characteristic religious fervour . The most well known are those fought against the Muslims of the eastern Mediterranean for the Holy Land between 1096 and 1271 . Crusades were also fought from the 12th century against the Iberian Moors , the Ottoman Empire and in several other regions . The reasons for thesse included fighting pagans , the suppression of heresy and conflict between Catholic groups . In 1095 Pope Urban II proclaimed the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont . He encouraged military support for the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I against the Seljuk Turks and an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem . There was an enthusiastic response in western European across all social strata . Historians debate the combination of motivations of the volunteers who took a public vow to join the crusade - the prospect of mass ascension into Heaven at Jerusalem , satisfying feudal obligations , opportunities for renown , economic and political advantage are all considered . Four Crusader states were established in the Near East : the County of Edessa ; the Principality of Antioch ; the Kingdom of Jerusalem ; and the County of Tripoli . A crusader presence remained in the region in some form until Acre , the last mainland outpost , fell in 1291 , after which there were no further crusades to recover the Holy Land .",
  "/wiki/Black_Plague": "The Black Death , also known as the Pestilence ( Pest for short ) , the Great Plague or the Plague , or less commonly the Black Plague , was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 75 to 200 million people in Eurasia , peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351 . The bacterium Yersinia pestis , which results in several forms of plague ( septicemic , pneumonic and , the most common , bubonic ) is believed to have been the cause . The Black Death was the first major European outbreak of plague and the second plague pandemic . The plague created a number of religious , social and economic upheavals , with profound effects on the course of European history . The Black Death is thought to have originated in the dry plains of Central Asia or East Asia , where it travelled along the Silk Road , reaching Crimea by 1343 . From there , it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that traveled on all merchant ships , spreading throughout the Mediterranean Basin and Europe . The Black Death is estimated to have killed 30% to 60% of Europe 's population . In total , the plague may have reduced the world population from an estimated 475 million to 350-375 million in the 14th century . It took 200 years for the world population to recover to its previous level . The plague recurred as outbreaks in Europe until the 19th century .",

Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury , the Apostle to the English , sent from Rome in the year 597 . Welby succeeded Rowan Williams . From the time of Augustine until the 16th century , the archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and usually received the pallium from the Pope . During the English Reformation , the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope . Thomas Cranmer became the first holder of the office following the English Reformation in 1533 , while Reginald Pole was the last Roman Catholic in the position , serving from 1556 to 1558 during the Counter-Reformation . In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops . At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral , the Pope , or the King of England . Since the English Reformation , the Church of England has been more explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the Crown ; today it is made by the reigning monarch on the advice of the British prime minister , who in turn receives a shortlist of two names from an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission .",

The film was remade and re-edited from the 1966 film titled The Passion According to Andrei by Tarkovsky which was censored during the first decade of the Brezhnev era in the Soviet Union . The film is loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev , the 15th-century Russian icon painter . The film features Anatoly Solonitsyn , Nikolai Grinko , Ivan Lapikov , Nikolai Sergeyev , Nikolai Burlyayev and Tarkovsky 's wife Irma Raush . Savva Yamshchikov , a famous Russian restorer and art historian , was a scientific consultant of the film . Andrei Rublev is set against the background of 15th-century Russia . Although the film is only loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev , it seeks to depict a realistic portrait of medieval Russia . Tarkovsky sought to create a film that shows the artist as a world-historic figure and Christianity as an axiom of Russia 's historical identity during a turbulent period of Russian history that ultimately resulted in the Tsardom of Russia . The film 's themes include artistic freedom , religion , political ambiguity , autodidacticism , and the making of art under a repressive regime .

It is the world 's second-largest religion with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1% of the world 's population , commonly known as Muslims . Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries . Islam teaches that God is merciful , all-powerful , and unique , and has guided mankind through prophets , revealed scriptures and natural signs . The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran , believed to be the verbatim word of God , and the teachings and normative examples ( called the sunnah , composed of accounts called hadith ) of Muhammad ( c. 570 - 8 June 632 CE ) . Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam , Abraham , Moses and Jesus . Muslims consider the Quran in its Arabic to be the unaltered and final revelation of God . Like other Abrahamic religions , Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded in paradise and unrighteous punished in hell . Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam , which are obligatory acts of worship , and following Islamic law ( sharia ) , which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society , from banking and welfare to women and the environment . The cities of Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam . Aside from the theological narrative , Islam is historically believed to have originated in the early 7th century CE in Mecca , and by the 8th century the Umayyad Caliphate extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east . The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century , during the Abbasid Caliphate , when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific , economic and cultural flourishing .",
