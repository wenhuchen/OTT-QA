  "/wiki/Districts_of_Bhutan": "The Kingdom of Bhutan is divided into 20 districts ( Dzongkha : dzongkhags ) . Bhutan is located between the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and India on the eastern slopes of the Himalayas in South Asia . Dzongkhags are the primary subdivisions of Bhutan . They possess a number of powers and rights under the Constitution of Bhutan , such as regulating commerce , running elections , and creating local governments . The Local Government Act of 2009 established local governments in each of the 20 dzongkhags overseen by the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs . Each dzongkhag has its own elected government with non-legislative executive powers , called a dzongkhag tshogdu ( district council ) . The dzongkhag tshogdu is assisted by the dzongkhag administration headed by a dzongkdag ( royal appointees who are the chief executive officer of each dzongkhag ) . Each dzongkhag also has a dzongkhag court presided over by a dzongkhag drangpon ( judge ) , who is appointed by the Chief Justice of Bhutan on the advice of Royal Judicial Service Council . The dzongkhags , and their residents , are represented in the Parliament of Bhutan , a bicameral legislature consisting of the National Council and the National Assembly . Each dzongkhag has one National Council representative . National Assembly representatives are distributed among the dzongkhags in proportion to their registered voter population as recommended by the Delimitation Commission , provided that no dzongkhag shall have less than two and more than seven National Assembly constituencies . As of the 2017 census , Thimphu is the most populous dzongkhag , with 138,736 residents ; Gasa is the least populous with 3,952 residents .",
  "/wiki/Gewog": "A gewog ( Dzongkha : \u0f62\u0f92\u0f7a\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f60\u0f7c\u0f42 geok , block ) , in the past also spelled as geog , refers to a group of villages in Bhutan . The head of a gewog is called a gup ( \u0f62\u0f92\u0f7a\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f7c\u0f0b gepo ) . Gewogs form a geographic administrative unit below dzongkhag districts ( and dungkhag subdistricts , where they exist ) , and above Dzongkhag Thromde class B and Yenlag Thromde municipalities . Dzongkhag Thromde class A municipalities have their own independent local government body . Bhutan comprises 205 gewogs , which average 230 km\u00b2 in area . The gewogs in turn are divided into chewogs for elections and thromdes municipalities for administration . The Parliament of Bhutan passed legislation in 2002 and 2007 on the status , structure , and leadership of local governments , including gewogs . The most recent legislation by parliament regarding gewogs is the Local Government Act of Bhutan 2009 . In July 2011 , the government slated 11 gewogs across Bhutan for reorganization , including both mergers and bifurcations , to be debated in dzongkhag local governments . These changes are contemplated to promote ease of travel to gewog capitals and to equitably allocate development resources .",
