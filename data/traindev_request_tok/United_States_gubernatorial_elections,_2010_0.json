  "/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)": "The Republican Party , also referred to as the GOP ( Grand Old Party ) , is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States ; the other is its historic rival , the Democratic Party . The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain U.S. territories . The party supported classical liberalism , opposed the expansion of slavery , and supported economic reform . Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president . Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress , slavery was banned in the United States in 1865 . The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System . After 1912 , the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right . Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the party 's core base shifted , with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics . The party 's 21st-century base of support includes people living in rural areas , men , people without college degrees , the elderly , white Americans , and evangelical Christians . The 21st-century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism , which incorporates both economic policies and social values . The GOP supports lower taxes , free market capitalism , restrictions on immigration , increased military spending , gun rights , restrictions on abortion , deregulation and restrictions on labor unions . After the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade , the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals .",

  "/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)": "The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States , along with its main rival , the Republican Party . Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison 's Democratic-Republican Party , the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson , making it the world 's oldest active political party . In its early years , the Party supported limited government , state sovereignty and opposed banks and the abolition of slavery . Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s , the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform . Well into the 20th century , the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings ; following the New Deal , however , the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South . The New Deal Coalition of 1932-1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction - many of whom were Catholics based in the cities . After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , the core bases of the two parties shifted , with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic . The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s . White evangelicals and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local levels since the 1990s . People living in urban areas , women , college graduates , sexual and gender minorities , millennials , and black , Latino , Jewish , Muslim and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic Party .

  "/wiki/2010_Michigan_gubernatorial_election": "The Michigan gubernatorial election of 2010 was held on November 2 , 2010 . Incumbent Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm was prohibited by the state 's Constitution from seeking a third term . This resulted in a large pool of candidates which was whittled down , when the May 11 filing deadline passed , to two Democrats and five Republicans . Both the Cook Political Report and the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report rated the election as leaning Republican . The Republican primary race was highly competitive ; both local and national polling reported Congressman Peter Hoekstra , state Attorney General Mike Cox , and businessman Rick Snyder as being front-runners for the Republican Party nomination . The Democratic front-runner when the 2009 polls were conducted , Lieutenant Governor John D. Cherry , withdrew from the race in January 2010 . The final polls just days before the primary election showed that , while Lansing mayor Virg Bernero was in the lead , over a quarter of those polled were still undecided . The deadline for candidates to file nominating petitions for the August 3 state primary was 4:00 PM on May 11 , 2010 . A total of 1,575,167 registered voters voted in the primaries , with 66.4% of them voting in the Republican primary . Analysts believe a large portion of Democrats crossed party lines to vote for Snyder , whose ad campaign targeted bipartisan and independent support .
