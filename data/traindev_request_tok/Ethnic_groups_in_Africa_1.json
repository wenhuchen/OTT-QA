Beginning in the 15th century , numerous European powers contested the area for trading rights , with the British ultimately established control of the coast by the late 19th century . Following over a century of native resistance , Ghana 's current borders were established by the 1900s as the British Gold Coast . It became independent of the United Kingdom on 6 March 1957 . Ghana 's population of approximately 30 million spans a variety of ethnic , linguistic and religious groups . According to the 2010 census , 71.2% of the population was Christian , 17.6% was Muslim , and 5.2% practised traditional faiths .

Niger covers a land area of almost 1,270,000 km2 ( 490,000 sq mi ) , making it the largest country in West Africa . Over 80% of its land area lies in the Sahara Desert . The country 's predominantly Muslim population of about 22 million live mostly in clusters in the far south and west of the country . The capital and largest city is Niamey , located in Niger 's southwest corner . Niger is a developing country , which consistently ranks near the bottom in the United Nations ' Human Development Index ( HDI ) ; it was ranked 187th of 188 countries for 2015 and 189th out of 189 countries in the 2018 report . Many of the non-desert portions of the country are threatened by periodic drought and desertification . The economy is concentrated around subsistence , with some export agriculture in the more fertile south , and export of raw materials , especially uranium ore. Niger faces serious challenges to development due to its landlocked position , desert terrain , inefficient agriculture , high fertility rates without birth control , and the resulting overpopulation , the poor educational level and poverty of its people , lack of infrastructure , poor healthcare , and environmental degradation . Nigerien society reflects a diversity drawn from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and regions and their relatively short period living in a single state . Historically , what is now Niger has been on the fringes of several large states . Since independence , Nigeriens have lived under five constitutions and three periods of military rule .",

After the fall of Kush , the Nubians formed the three Christian kingdoms of Nobatia , Makuria and Alodia , with the latter two lasting until around 1500 . Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by Arab nomads . From the 16th-19th centuries , central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the Funj sultanate , while Darfur ruled the west and the Ottomans the far north .

It is the seventh-largest country in Africa , bordered by Namibia to the south , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north , Zambia to the east , and the Atlantic Ocean to the west . Angola has an exclave province , the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda . The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era , hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups , tribes and kingdoms . The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato , the Kwanyama and the Mbunda . After a protracted anti-colonial struggle , independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist-Leninist People 's Republic of Angola , a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba . The civil war between the ruling People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa , lasted until 2002 . The sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary , presidential constitutional republic . Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves , and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war ; however , the standard of living remains low for most of the population , and life expectancy in Angola is among the lowest in the world , while infant mortality is among the highest .",

It is bordered by five countries : Gabon to its west ; Cameroon to its northwest and the Central African Republic to its northeast ; the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the southeast and the Angolan exclave of Cabinda to its south ; and the Atlantic Ocean to its southwest . The region was dominated by Bantu-speaking tribes at least 3,000 years ago , who built trade links leading into the Congo River basin . Congo was formerly part of the French colony of Equatorial Africa . The Republic of the Congo was established on 28 November 1958 but gained independence from France in 1960 . It was a Marxist-Leninist state from 1969 to 1992 , under the name People 's Republic of the Congo . The sovereign state has had multi-party elections since 1992 , although a democratically elected government was ousted in the 1997 Republic of the Congo Civil War , and President Denis Sassou Nguesso , who first came to power in 1979 , has ruled for 35 of the past 40 years . The Republic of the Congo has become the fourth-largest oil producer in the Gulf of Guinea , providing the country with a degree of prosperity despite political and economic instability in some areas and unequal distribution of oil revenue nationwide . Congo 's economy is heavily dependent on the oil sector , and economic growth has slowed considerably since the post-2015 drop in oil prices .",

In Berber languages , Tamazgha refers to the Maghreb region together with smaller parts of Mali , Niger , Egypt , and the Spanish Canary Islands - the lands traditionally inhabited by Arab-Berbers . The Maghreb is usually defined as much of northern Africa , including a large portion of Africa 's Sahara Desert , but excludes Egypt and Sudan , which are considered to be in the Mashriq , the eastern part of the Arab world . The traditional definition of the Maghreb , which restricted it to the Atlas Mountains and the coastal plains of Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , and Libya , was expanded by the inclusion of Mauritania and the disputed territory of Western Sahara . During the era of Al-Andalus in the Iberian Peninsula ( 711-1492 ) , the Maghreb 's inhabitants , the Muslim Berbers or Maghrebi , were known by Europeans as Moors , or as Afariqah ( Roman Africans ) .

In 1965 , the UN General Assembly adopted its first resolution on Western Sahara , asking Spain to decolonize the territory . One year later , a new resolution was passed by the General Assembly requesting that a referendum be held by Spain on self-determination . In 1975 , Spain relinquished the administrative control of the territory to a joint administration by Morocco ( which had formally claimed the territory since 1957 ) and Mauritania .

  "/wiki/Zimbabwe": "Zimbabwe ( /z\u026am\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0bwe\u026a , -wi/ ) , officially the Republic of Zimbabwe , formerly Rhodesia , is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa , between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers , bordered by South Africa , Botswana , Zambia and Mozambique . The capital and largest city is Harare . The second largest is Bulawayo . A country of roughly 14 million people , Zimbabwe has 16 official languages , with English , Shona , and Ndebele the most common . Since the 11th century , present-day Zimbabwe has been the site of several organised states and kingdoms as well as a major route for migration and trade . The British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes first demarcated the present territory during the 1890s ; it became the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1923 . In 1965 , the conservative white minority government unilaterally declared independence as Rhodesia . The state endured international isolation and a 15-year guerrilla war with black nationalist forces ; this culminated in a peace agreement that established universal enfranchisement and de jure sovereignty as Zimbabwe in April 1980 . Zimbabwe then joined the Commonwealth of Nations , from which it was suspended in 2002 for breaches of international law by its then-government , and from which it withdrew in December 2003 . The sovereign state is a member of the United Nations , the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , the African Union ( AU ) , and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) . It was once known as the Jewel of Africa for its great prosperity . Robert Mugabe became Prime Minister of Zimbabwe in 1980 , when his ZANU-PF party won the elections following the end of white minority rule ; he was the President of Zimbabwe from 1987 until his resignation in 2017 .",

The sovereign state is separated from the Comoros , Mayotte and Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east . The capital and largest city of Mozambique is Maputo ( formerly known as Louren\u00e7o Marques from 1876 to 1976 ) . Between the first and fifth centuries AD , Bantu-speaking peoples migrated to present-day Mozambique from farther north and west . Northern Mozambique lies within the monsoon trade winds of the Indian Ocean . Between the 7th and 11th centuries , a series of Swahili port towns developed here , which contributed to the development of a distinct Swahili culture and language . In the late medieval period , these towns were frequented by traders from Somalia , Ethiopia , Egypt , Arabia , Persia , and India . The voyage of Vasco da Gama in 1498 marked the arrival of the Portuguese , who began a gradual process of colonisation and settlement in 1505 . After over four centuries of Portuguese rule , Mozambique gained independence in 1975 , becoming the People 's Republic of Mozambique shortly thereafter . After only two years of independence , the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting from 1977 to 1992 . In 1994 , Mozambique held its first multiparty elections , and has since remained a relatively stable presidential republic , although it still faces a low-intensity insurgency . Mozambique is endowed with rich and extensive natural resources .",

Across the Gulf of Aden lies Yemen , which does not share a land border with Djibouti . The country has a total area of 23,200 km2 ( 8,958 sq mi ) . The state of Djibouti is predominantly inhabited by two ethnic groups , the Somali and the Afar people , with the former comprising the majority of the population . In antiquity , the territory together with Somalia was part of the Land of Punt . Nearby Zeila , now in Somalia , was the seat of the medieval Adal and Ifat Sultanates . In the late 19th century , the colony of French Somaliland was established following treaties signed by the ruling Somali and Afar sultans with the French and its railroad to Dire Dawa ( and later Addis Ababa ) allowed it to quickly supersede Zeila as the port for southern Ethiopia and the Ogaden . It was subsequently renamed to the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas in 1967 . A decade later , the Djiboutian people voted for independence . This officially marked the establishment of the Republic of Djibouti , named after its capital city . The sovereign state joined the United Nations the same year , on 20 September 1977 In the early 1990s , tensions over government representation led to armed conflict , which ended in a power-sharing agreement in 2000 between the ruling party and the opposition .",
  "/wiki/Yoruba_people": "The Yoruba people ( Yoruba : \u00ccran Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 ) are an African ethnic group that inhabits western Africa , mainly Nigeria and Benin . The Yoruba constitute about 44 million people in total . The vast majority of this population is from Nigeria , where the Yoruba make up 16% of the country 's population , making them one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa . Most Yoruba people speak the Yoruba language , which is the Niger-Congo language with the largest number of native speakers . The Yoruba share borders with the very closely related Itsekiri to the south-east in the North West Niger delta , Bariba to the north in Benin and Nigeria , the Nupe also to the north and the Ebira to the northeast in central Nigeria . To the east are the Edo , \u1eb8san and the Afemai groups in mid-western Nigeria . Adjacent to the Ebira and Edo groups are the related Igala people found in the northeast , on the left bank of the Niger River . To the southwest are the Gbe speaking Mahi , Gun , Fon and Ewe who border Yoruba communities in Benin and Togo . To the southeast are Itsekiri who live in the north-west end of the Niger delta . They are ancestrally related to the Yoruba but chose to maintain a distinct cultural identity . Significant Yoruba populations in other West African countries can be found in Ghana , Benin , Ivory Coast [ citation needed ] , and Sierra Leone . The Yoruba diaspora consists of two main groupings ; one of them includes relatively recent migrants , the majority of which moved to the United Kingdom and the United States after major economic and political changes in the 1960s to 1980s .",
  "/wiki/Sierra_Leone_Creole_people": "The Sierra Leone Creole people ( or Krio people ) is an ethnic group in Sierra Leone . The Creole people are descendants of freed African American , West Indian , and Liberated African slaves who settled in the Western Area of Sierra Leone between 1787 and about 1885 . The colony was established by the British , supported by abolitionists , under the Sierra Leone Company as a place for freedmen . The settlers called their new settlement Freetown . Today , the Creoles comprise about 2% of the population of Sierra Leone . Like their Americo-Liberian neighbors and sister ethnic group in Liberia , Creoles have varying degrees of European ancestry due to the close historical relations between the ethnicities through decades of indenture , slavery and sexual abuse , and voluntary unions and marriages in North America . Some have Native American ancestry as well . In Sierra Leone , some of the settlers intermarried with other English or Europeans . Through the Jamaican Maroons , some Creoles probably also have indigenous Jamaican Amerindian Ta\u00edno ancestry . The Americo-Liberians and the Creoles are the only recognised ethnic group of African-American , Liberated African , and West Indian descent in West Africa . The Creole culture is primarily westernized . The only Sierra Leonean ethnic group whose culture is similar ( in terms of its integration of Western culture ) are the Sherbro , who had developed close connections with Europeans and English traders from the early years of contact .",
  "/wiki/Zulu_people": "The Zulu ( /zu\u02d0lu\u02d0/ ; Zulu : amaZulu ) , or also known as Amazulu , are a Bantu ethnic group of Southern Africa . The Zulu are the largest ethnic group in South Africa with an estimated 10-12 million people living mainly in the province of KwaZulu-Natal . The Zulu originated from Ngini communities who took part in the Bantu migrations . As the clans integrated together , the rulership of Shaka brought success to the Zulu nation due to his perfected military policies . The Zulu take pride in their ceremonies such as the Umhlanga , or Reed Dance , and their various forms of beadwork . The art and skill of beadwork takes part in the identification of Zulu people and acts as a form of communication . The men and women both serve different purposes in society in order to function as a whole . The Zulu predominately believe in Christianity , but have created a syncretic religion that is combined with the Zulu 's prior belief systems .",
  "/wiki/South_Africa": "South Africa , officially the Republic of South Africa ( RSA ) , is the southernmost country in Africa . It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres ( 1,739 mi ) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans ; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia , Botswana , and Zimbabwe ; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini ( Swaziland ) ; and it surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho . South Africa is the largest country in Southern Africa and the 24th-largest country in the world by land area and , with over 58 million people , is also the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Bantu ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European , Asian ( Indian ) , and multiracial ( Coloured ) ancestry . South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is the fourth-highest number in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics ."
