With the gradual abolition of the legal restrictions on the activities of Catholics in England and Wales in the early 19th century , Rome decided to proceed to bridge the gap of the centuries from Queen Elizabeth I by instituting Catholic dioceses on the regular historical pattern . Thus Pope Pius IX issued the Bull Universalis Ecclesiae of 29 September 1850 by which thirteen new dioceses which did not formally claim any continuity with the pre-Elizabethan English dioceses were created . One of these was the diocese of Birmingham . This has its origins in the Vicariates Apostolic of England , of the Midland District and lastly of the Central District . The last Vicar Apostolic of the Central District , from 28 July 1848 , was Bishop William Bernard Ullathorne , O.S.B. , who on 29 September 1850 became the first Bishop of Birmingham .

The county itself is a NUTS 2 region within the wider NUTS 1 region of the same name . The county consists of seven metropolitan boroughs : the City of Birmingham , the City of Coventry and the City of Wolverhampton , as well as the boroughs of Dudley , Sandwell , Solihull and Walsall . The metropolitan county exists in law and as a geographic frame of reference , and as a ceremonial county it has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff .

A new administrative body for the county ( and some of the district surrounding it as Non-Constituent members ) , the West Midlands Combined Authority , was created in June 2016 . Since May 2017 , the authority has been headed by a directly elected Mayor of the West Midlands , a position currently held by Andy Street of the Conservative Party . Other county-wide bodies include the West Midlands Police , the West Midlands Fire Service and Transport for West Midlands . The county is sometimes described as the West Midlands metropolitan area or the West Midlands conurbation or Greater Birmingham , although these have different , and less clearly defined , boundaries .

During the second half of the first millennium Ceredigion was a minor kingdom . It has been administered as a county since 1282 . Welsh is spoken by more than half the population . Ceredigion is considered to be a centre of Welsh culture . The county is mainly rural with over 50 miles ( 80 km ) of coastline and a mountainous hinterland . The numerous sandy beaches and the long-distance Ceredigion Coast Path provide excellent views of Cardigan Bay . In the 18th and early 19th centuries , Cardiganshire had more industry than it does today ; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county ; lead , silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour . The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market . During the 20th century , livestock farming became less profitable , and the county 's population declined as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated . However , there has been a population increase caused by elderly people moving to the county for retirement , and various government initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income .

  "/wiki/Dorset": "Dorset ( /\u02c8d\u0254\u02d0rs\u026at/ ; archaically : Dorsetshire ) is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast . The ceremonial county comprises the unitary authority areas of Bournemouth , Christchurch and Poole and Dorset . Covering an area of 2,653 square kilometres ( 1,024 sq mi ) , Dorset borders Devon to the west , Somerset to the north-west , Wiltshire to the north-east , and Hampshire to the east . The county town is Dorchester which is in the south . After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county 's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch . Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation , while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density . The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the Early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : in the English Civil War , an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the Second World War , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points . The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics , and both have clubs or hire venues for sailing , Cornish pilot gig rowing , sea kayaking and powerboating .",

The county town is the city of Winchester . Its two largest cities , Southampton and Portsmouth , are administered separately as unitary authorities ; the rest of the county is governed by Hampshire County Council . First settled about 14,000 years ago , Hampshire 's history dates to Roman Britain , when its chief town was Winchester . When the Romans left Britain , the area was infiltrated by tribes from Scandinavia and mainland Europe , principally in the river valleys . The county was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book , divided into 44 hundreds . From the 12th century , the ports grew in importance , fuelled by trade with the continent , wool and cloth manufacture in the county , and the fishing industry , and a shipbuilding industry was established . By the 16th century , the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester . By the mid-19th century , with the county 's population at 219,210 ( double that at the beginning of the century ) in more than 86,000 dwellings , agriculture was the principal industry and 10 per cent of the county was still forest .

It is in the English Channel , between 2 and 5 miles off the coast of Hampshire , separated by the Solent . The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times , and is known for its mild climate , coastal scenery , and verdant landscape of fields , downland and chines . The island is designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve . The island has been home to the poets Swinburne and Tennyson and to Queen Victoria , who built her much-loved summer residence and final home Osborne House at East Cowes . It has a maritime and industrial tradition including boat-building , sail-making , the manufacture of flying boats , the hovercraft , and Britain 's space rockets . The island hosts annual music festivals including the Isle of Wight Festival , which in 1970 was the largest rock music event ever held . It has well-conserved wildlife and some of the richest cliffs and quarries for dinosaur fossils in Europe . The isle was owned by a Norman family until 1293 and was earlier a kingdom in its own right . In common with the Crown dependencies , the British Crown was then represented on the island by the Governor of the Isle of Wight [ n 1 ] until 1995 . The island has played an important part in the defence of the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth , and been near the front-line of conflicts through the ages , including the Spanish Armada and the Battle of Britain . Rural for most of its history , its Victorian fashionability and the growing affordability of holidays led to significant urban development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries .",

They include two Crown dependencies : the Bailiwick of Jersey , which is the largest of the islands ; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey , consisting of Guernsey , Alderney , Sark , Herm and some smaller islands . They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy and , although they are not part of the United Kingdom , the UK is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands . The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations nor of the European Union . They have a total population of about 170,499 , and the bailiwicks ' capitals , Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port , have populations of 33,500 and 18,207 , respectively . Channel Islands is a geographical term , not a political unit . The two bailiwicks have been administered separately since the late 13th century . Each has its own independent laws , elections , and representative bodies ( although in modern times , politicians from the islands ' legislatures are in regular contact ) . Any institution common to both is the exception rather than the rule . The Bailiwick of Guernsey is divided into three jurisdictions - Guernsey , Alderney and Sark - each with its own legislature . Although there are a few pan-island institutions ( such as the Channel Islands office to the EU in Brussels , which is actually a joint venture between the bailiwicks ) , these tend to be established structurally as equal projects between Guernsey and Jersey . Otherwise , entities proclaiming membership of both Guernsey and Jersey might in fact be from one bailiwick only , for instance the Channel Islands Securities Exchange is in Saint Peter Port ( and therefore Guernsey ) .",

  "/wiki/Bishop_of_Salford": "The Bishop of Salford is the Ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford in the Province of Liverpool , England . With the gradual abolition of the legal restrictions on the activities of Catholics in England and Wales in the early 19th century , Rome decided to proceed to bridge the gap of the centuries from Queen Elizabeth I by instituting Catholic dioceses on the regular historical pattern . On 29 September 1850 , Pope Pius IX issued the Bull Universalis Ecclesiae which created thirteen new dioceses which did not formally claim any continuity with the pre-Elizabethan English dioceses of which one of these was the diocese of Salford and went on to take up the reins of part of the former Vicariate Apostolic of the Lancashire District . In the early period from 1850 the diocese was a suffragan of the Metropolitan See of Westminster , but a further development was its assignment under Pope Pius X , on 28 October 1911 , to a newly created Province of Liverpool . At the diocese 's creation the territory assigned to it was the hundreds of Salford and Blackburn . The diocese currently covers an area of 1,600 km2 ( 600 sq mi ) and consists of a large part of Greater Manchester and adjacent parts of Lancashire . The see is in the Salford area of Greater Manchester , where the Bishop 's cathedra or seat is located in the Salford Cathedral , which was dedicated on 14 June 1890 .

It is landlocked and borders Cheshire ( to the south-west and south ) , Derbyshire ( to the south-east ) , West Yorkshire ( to the north-east ) , Lancashire ( to the north ) and Merseyside ( to the west ) . There is a mix of high-density urban areas , suburbs , semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester , but land use is mostly urban - the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry . It has a focused central business district , formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford , but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts , each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs . Greater Manchester is governed by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority ( GMCA ) , which consists of political leaders from each of the ten metropolitan borough councils , plus a directly elected mayor , with responsibility for economic development , regeneration and transport . Andy Burnham is the inaugural Mayor of Greater Manchester , elected in 2017 . For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government ; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council .

It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west .
