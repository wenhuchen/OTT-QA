  "/wiki/Man_from_the_Deep_River": "Il paese del sesso selvaggio ( English : The Country of Savage Sex ) , also known as Man From Deep River , Deep River Savages and Sacrifice ! , is a 1972 Italian cannibal exploitation film directed by Umberto Lenzi and starring Ivan Rassimov , Me Me Lai and Pratitsak Singhara . It is perhaps best known for starting the cannibal boom of Italian exploitation cinema during the late 1970s and early 1980s . Lenzi was probably trying to imitate the content of notorious Mondo cinema , which had gained considerable Grindhouse popularity since Gualtiero Jacopetti and Paolo Cavara made Mondo Cane in 1962 , even though this film is fictional . Like Man from Deep River , Mondo films often focus on exotic customs and locations , graphic violence , and animal cruelty . The film was mainly inspired by A Man Called Horse , which also featured a white man who is incorporated into a tribe that originally held him captive . The title Man from Deep River is even supposed to echo the title A Man Called Horse .",

  "/wiki/Cannibal_Holocaust": "Cannibal Holocaust is a 1980 Italian cannibal horror film directed by Ruggero Deodato and written by Gianfranco Clerici . It stars Robert Kerman as Harold Monroe , an anthropologist from New York University who leads a rescue team into the Amazon rainforest to locate a crew of filmmakers . Played by Carl Gabriel Yorke , Francesca Ciardi , Perry Pirkanen , and Luca Barbareschi , the crew had gone missing while filming a documentary on local cannibal tribes . When the rescue team is only able to recover the crew 's lost cans of film , an American television station wishes to broadcast the footage as a sensationalized television special . Upon viewing the reels , Monroe is appalled by the team 's actions and objects to the station 's intent to air the documentary . Influenced by the documentaries of Mondo director Gualtiero Jacopetti , Cannibal Holocaust was inspired by Italian media coverage of Red Brigades terrorism . The coverage included news reports that Deodato believed to be staged , an idea which became an integral aspect of the film 's story . Approximately half of the film consists of the documentary crew 's lost footage , the presentation of which innovated the found footage genre that was later popularized in American cinema by The Blair Witch Project . Noted for its realism , Cannibal Holocaust was filmed primarily on location in the Amazon rainforest of Colombia with indigenous tribes interacting with American and Italian actors . Cannibal Holocaust achieved notoriety as its graphic violence aroused a great deal of controversy . After its premiere in Italy , it was ordered to be seized by a local magistrate , and Deodato was arrested on obscenity charges . He was later charged with multiple counts of murder due to rumors that claimed several actors were killed on camera .",
