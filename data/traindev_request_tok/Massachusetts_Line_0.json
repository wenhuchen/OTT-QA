After eleven months of the siege , the British abandoned Boston by sailing to Nova Scotia .

The Continental Congress formed the Continental Army from the militia , with George Washington as its Commander in Chief . In June 1775 , the British seized Bunker and Breed 's Hills , from which the Continentals were preparing to bombard the city , but their casualties were heavy and their gains were insufficient to break the Continental Army 's hold on land access to Boston . The Americans laid siege to the British-occupied city . Military actions during the remainder of the siege were limited to occasional raids , minor skirmishes , and sniper fire . In November 1775 , George Washington sent the 25-year-old bookseller-turned-soldier Henry Knox to bring to Boston the heavy artillery that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga .

The battle is named after Bunker Hill in Charlestown , Massachusetts , which was peripherally involved in the battle . It was the original objective of both the colonial and British troops , though the majority of combat took place on the adjacent hill which later became known as Breed 's Hill . On June 13 , 1775 , the leaders of the colonial forces besieging Boston learned that the British were planning to send troops out from the city to fortify the unoccupied hills surrounding the city , which would give them control of Boston Harbor . In response , 1,200 colonial troops under the command of William Prescott stealthily occupied Bunker Hill and Breed 's Hill . During the night , the colonists constructed a strong redoubt on Breed 's Hill , as well as smaller fortified lines across the Charlestown Peninsula . By daybreak of June 17 , the British became aware of the presence of colonial forces on the Peninsula and mounted an attack against them that day . Two assaults on the colonial positions were repulsed with significant British casualties ; the third and final attack carried the redoubt after the defenders ran out of ammunition . The colonists retreated to Cambridge over Bunker Hill , leaving the British in control of the Peninsula . The battle was a tactical , though somewhat Pyrrhic victory for the British , as it proved to be a sobering experience for them , involving many more casualties than the Americans had incurred , including many officers . The battle had demonstrated that inexperienced militia were able to stand up to regular army troops in battle . Subsequently , the battle discouraged the British from any further frontal attacks against well defended front lines .",
