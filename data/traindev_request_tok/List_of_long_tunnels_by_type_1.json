  "/wiki/Brenner_Base_Tunnel": "The Brenner Base Tunnel ( German : Brennerbasistunnel ; Italian : Galleria di base del Brennero ) is an under-construction 55-kilometre-long ( 34 mi ) railway tunnel through the base of the Eastern Alps beneath the Brenner Pass . It will run from near Innsbruck , in Austria , to Fortezza , in Italy , replacing part of the current Brenner railway . The line is part of Line 1 , the Berlin to Palermo route , of Trans-European Transport Networks ( TEN-T ) . The Brenner Pass , in the Alps at the border between Austria and Italy , is one of the most important traffic connections between northern and southern Europe , and the motorway going over it is infamous for its frequent traffic jams . [ citation needed ] Pollution from this traffic is a major concern . [ citation needed ] The hope is to relieve this situation by greatly improving the railway connection between North Tyrol and South Tyrol with the new tunnel , which will allow trains to cross the Alps much faster . Currently , speeds in the Brenner region barely exceed 70 km/h ( 43 mph ) due to the steepness of the existing tracks , which cross the pass at an elevation of 1,371 metres above sea level . The travel time from Innsbruck to Bolzano will be reduced from 2 hours to 50 minutes . The project is funded by Austria and Italy , and a contribution by the European Union . Due to the magnitude of the project ( it will be the world 's second-longest tunnel , after the Gotthard Base Tunnel ) , the funding promised so far will not suffice for the estimated costs . The tunnel is scheduled to be completed in 2028 .",

For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE .
