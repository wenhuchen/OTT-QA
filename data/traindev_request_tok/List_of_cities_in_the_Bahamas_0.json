  "/wiki/Nassau,_Bahamas": "Nassau ( /\u02c8n\u00e6s\u0254\u02d0/ ) is the capital and largest city of The Bahamas . With a population of 274,400 as of 2016 , or just over 70% of the entire population of the Bahamas ( \u2248391,000 ) , Nassau is commonly defined as a primate city , dwarfing all other towns in the country . It is the centre of commerce , education , law , administration and media of the country . Lynden Pindling International Airport , the major airport for the Bahamas , is located about 16 kilometres ( 9.9 mi ) west of Nassau city centre , and has daily flights to major cities in Canada , the Caribbean , the United Kingdom and the United States . The city is located on the island of New Providence , which functions much like a business district . Nassau is the site of the House of Assembly and various judicial departments and was considered historically to be a stronghold of pirates . The city was named in honour of William III of England , Prince of Orange-Nassau . Nassau 's modern growth began in the late eighteenth century , with the influx of thousands of Loyalists and their slaves to the Bahamas following the American War of Independence . Many of them settled in Nassau ( then and still the commerce capital of the Bahamas ) and eventually came to outnumber the original inhabitants . As the population of Nassau grew , so did its populated areas . Today the city dominates the entire island and its satellite , Paradise Island . However , until the post-Second World War era , the outer suburbs scarcely existed .",
