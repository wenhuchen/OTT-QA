  "/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury": "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England , the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury . The current archbishop is Justin Welby , who was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013 . Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury , the Apostle to the English , sent from Rome in the year 597 . Welby succeeded Rowan Williams . From the time of Augustine until the 16th century , the archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and usually received the pallium from the Pope . During the English Reformation , the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope . Thomas Cranmer became the first holder of the office following the English Reformation in 1533 , while Reginald Pole was the last Roman Catholic in the position , serving from 1556 to 1558 during the Counter-Reformation . In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops . At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral , the Pope , or the King of England . Since the English Reformation , the Church of England has been more explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the Crown ; today it is made by the reigning monarch on the advice of the British prime minister , who in turn receives a shortlist of two names from an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission .",

The Bishop of Winchester is appointed by the Crown , and is one of five Church of England bishops who sit ex officio among the 26 Lords Spiritual in the House of Lords , regardless of their length of service . The Diocese of Winchester is one of the oldest and most important in England . Originally it was the episcopal see of the kingdom of Wessex or the West Saxons , with its cathedra at Dorchester Cathedral under Saints Birinus and Agilbert . The cathedral at Dorchester was founded in AD 634 by Birinius , a Roman missionary . The see was transferred to Winchester in AD 660 . Winchester was divided in AD 909 , with Wiltshire and Berkshire transferring to the new See of Ramsbury . Nevertheless , the domains of the Bishop of Winchester ran from the south coast to the south bank of the River Thames at Southwark , where the bishop had one of his palaces , making it one of the largest as well as one of the richest sees in the land . In more modern times , the former extent of the Diocese of Winchester was reduced by the formation of a new diocese of Southwark in south London , a new diocese of Guildford in Surrey and a new diocese of Portsmouth in Hampshire .
