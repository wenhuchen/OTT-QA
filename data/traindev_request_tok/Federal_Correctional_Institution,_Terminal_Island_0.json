Recruited from MIT , he joined Theodore von Karman 's group at Caltech . During WWII , he was involved in the Manhattan Project , which ultimately led to the successful development of the first atomic bomb in America . Later on , he would eventually return to China , where he would make important contributions to China 's missile and space program . During the Second Red Scare , in the 1950s , the US federal government accused him of communist sympathies . In 1950 , despite protests by his colleagues , he was stripped of his security clearance . He decided to return to China , but he was detained at Terminal Island , near Los Angeles . After spending five years under house arrest , he was released in 1955 in exchange for the repatriation of American pilots who had been captured during the Korean War . He left the United States in September 1955 on the American President Lines passenger liner SS President Cleveland , arriving in China via Hong Kong . Upon his return , he helped lead the Chinese nuclear weapons program . This effort ultimately led to China 's first successful atomic bomb test and hydrogen bomb test , making China the fifth nuclear weapons state , and achieving the fastest fission-to-fusion development in history . Additionally , Qian 's work led to the development of the Dongfeng ballistic missile and the Chinese space program .",

[ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty .

  "/wiki/Perjury": "Perjury is the intentional act of swearing a false oath or falsifying an affirmation to tell the truth , whether spoken or in writing , concerning matters material to an official proceeding . [ A ] In some jurisdictions , contrary to popular misconception , no crime has occurred when a false statement is ( intentionally or unintentionally ) made while under oath or subject to penalty . Instead , criminal culpability attaches only at the instant the declarant falsely asserts the truth of statements ( made or to be made ) that are material to the outcome of the proceeding . For example , it is not perjury to lie about one 's age except if age is a fact material to influencing the legal result , such as eligibility for old age retirement benefits or whether a person was of an age to have legal capacity . Perjury is considered a serious offense , as it can be used to usurp the power of the courts , resulting in miscarriages of justice . In the United States , for example , the general perjury statute under federal law classifies perjury as a felony and provides for a prison sentence of up to five years . The California Penal Code allows for perjury to be a capital offense in cases causing wrongful execution . Perjury which caused the wrongful execution of another or in the pursuit of causing the wrongful execution of another is respectively construed as murder or attempted murder , and is normally itself punishable by execution in countries that retain the death penalty . Perjury is considered a felony in most U.S. states as well as most Australian states . In Queensland , under Section 124 of the Queensland Criminal Code Act 1899 , perjury is punishable by up to life in prison if it is committed to procure an innocent person for a crime that is punishable by life in prison . However , prosecutions for perjury are rare . In some countries such as France and Italy , suspects can not be heard under oath or affirmation and so can not commit perjury , regardless of what they say during their trial .",

The word was popularized in English by the novel The Godfather ( 1969 ) and its film adaptation . In the novel , a consigliere is an advisor or counselor to the boss , with the additional responsibility of representing the boss in important meetings both within the boss 's crime family and with other crime families . The consigliere is a close , trusted friend and confidant , the mob 's version of an elder statesman ; he is an advisor to the boss in a Mafia crime family , and sometimes is his 'right-hand man ' . By the very nature of the job , a consigliere is one of the few in the family who can argue with the boss , and is often tasked with challenging the boss when needed , to ensure subsequent plans are foolproof . In some depictions , he is devoid of ambition and dispenses disinterested advice . This passive image of the consigliere does not correspond with what little is known of real-life consiglieri , however . A real-life Mafia consigliere is generally the number-three person in a crime family , after the boss and underboss in most cases . The boss , underboss , and consigliere constitute a three-man ruling panel , or administration .

His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he went to prison at age 33 . Capone was born in New York City in 1899 to Italian immigrant parents . He joined the Five Points Gang as a teenager , and became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels . In his early twenties , he moved to Chicago and became a bodyguard and trusted factotum for Johnny Torrio , head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol - the forerunner of the Outfit - and was politically protected through the Unione Siciliana . A conflict with the North Side Gang was instrumental in Capone 's rise and fall . Torrio went into retirement after North Side gunmen almost killed him , handing control to Capone . Capone expanded the bootlegging business through increasingly violent means , but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor William Hale Thompson and the city 's police meant he seemed safe from law enforcement . Capone apparently reveled in attention , such as the cheers from spectators when he appeared at ball games . He made donations to various charities and was viewed by many as modern-day Robin Hood .

Smuggling usually takes place to circumvent taxation or prohibition laws within a particular jurisdiction . The term rum-running is more commonly applied to smuggling over water ; bootlegging is applied to smuggling over land . It is believed that the term bootlegging originated during the American Civil War , when soldiers would sneak liquor into army camps by concealing pint bottles within their boots or beneath their trouser legs . Also , according to the PBS documentary Prohibition , the term bootlegging was popularized when thousands of city dwellers sold liquor from flasks they kept in their boot legs all across major cities and rural areas . The term rum-running most likely originated at the start of Prohibition in the United States ( 1920-1933 ) , when ships from Bimini in the western Bahamas transported cheap Caribbean rum to Florida speakeasies . But rum 's cheapness made it a low-profit item for the rum-runners , and they soon moved on to smuggling Canadian whisky , French champagne , and English gin to major cities like New York City , Boston , and Chicago , where prices ran high . It was said [ by whom ? ] that some ships carried $ 200,000 in contraband in a single run .",
  "/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States": "Prohibition in the United States was a nationwide constitutional ban on the production , importation , transportation , and sale of alcoholic beverages from 1920 to 1933 . Prohibitionists first attempted to end the trade in alcoholic beverages during the 19th century . Led by pietistic Protestants , they aimed to heal what they saw as an ill society beset by alcohol-related problems such as alcoholism , family violence and saloon-based political corruption . Many communities introduced alcohol bans in the late 19th and early 20th century , and enforcement of these new prohibition laws became a topic of debate . Prohibition supporters , called drys , presented it as a battle for public morals and health . The movement was taken up by social Progressives in the Prohibition , Democratic , and Republican parties and gained a national grassroots base through the Woman 's Christian Temperance Union . After 1900 , it was coordinated by the Anti-Saloon League . Opposition from the beer industry mobilized wet supporters from the wealthy Catholic and German Lutheran communities , but the influence of these groups receded from 1917 following the entry of the US into the First World War against Germany . The brewing industry was curtailed by a succession of state legislatures , and finally ended nationwide under the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920 , which passed with a 68 percent supermajority in the House of Representatives and 76 percent support in the Senate as well as ratification by forty-six out of forty-eight states . Enabling legislation , known as the Volstead Act , set down the rules for enforcing the federal ban and defined the types of alcoholic beverages that were prohibited . Not all alcohol was banned ; for example , religious use of wine was permitted . Private ownership and consumption of alcohol were not made illegal under federal law , but local laws were stricter in many areas , with some states banning possession outright .",
  "/wiki/Tax_evasion": "Tax evasion is the illegal evasion of taxes by individuals , corporations , and trusts . Tax evasion often entails taxpayers deliberately misrepresenting the true state of their affairs to the tax authorities to reduce their tax liability and includes dishonest tax reporting , such as declaring less income , profits or gains than the amounts actually earned , or overstating deductions . Tax evasion is an activity commonly associated with the informal economy . One measure of the extent of tax evasion ( the tax gap ) is the amount of unreported income , which is the difference between the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authorities and the actual amount reported . In contrast , tax avoidance is the legal use of tax laws to reduce one 's tax burden . Both tax evasion and avoidance can be viewed as forms of tax noncompliance , as they describe a range of activities that intend to subvert a state 's tax system , although such classification of tax avoidance is not indisputable , given that avoidance is lawful , within self-creating systems .",

According to Pesci , improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted . The director made transcripts of these sessions , took the lines he liked most and put them into a revised script , which the cast worked from during principal photography . Goodfellas premiered at the 47th Venice International Film Festival on September 9 , 1990 , and was released in the United States on September 19 , 1990 .

As a clinical psychologist at Harvard University , Leary worked on the Harvard Psilocybin Project from 1960-62 ( LSD and psilocybin were still legal in the United States at the time ) , resulting in the Concord Prison Experiment and the Marsh Chapel Experiment . The scientific legitimacy and ethics of his research were questioned by other Harvard faculty because he took psychedelics along with research subjects and pressured students to join in . Leary and his colleague , Richard Alpert ( who later became known as Ram Dass ) , were fired from Harvard University in May 1963 . Most people first heard of psychedelics after the Harvard scandal . Leary believed that LSD showed potential for therapeutic use in psychiatry . He used LSD himself and developed a philosophy of mind expansion and personal truth through LSD . After leaving Harvard , he continued to publicly promote the use of psychedelic drugs and became a well-known figure of the counterculture of the 1960s . He popularized catchphrases that promoted his philosophy , such as turn on , tune in , drop out , set and setting , and think for yourself and question authority . He also wrote and spoke frequently about transhumanist concepts of space migration , intelligence increase , and life extension ( SMI\u00b2LE ) .

In mid-1967 , he formed what became known as the Manson Family , a quasi-commune based in California . His followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969 . According to the Los Angeles County district attorney , Manson plotted to start a race war , though he and others disputed this motive . In 1971 , he was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people . The prosecution conceded that Manson never literally ordered the murders , but they contended that his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy . Manson was also convicted of first-degree murder for the deaths of Gary Hinman and Donald Shea . Manson was an unemployed ex-convict who had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions at the time when he began gathering his cult following .

  "/wiki/Los_Angeles_crime_family": "The Los Angeles crime family , also known as the L.A. Mafia , is an Italian American criminal organization based in California , as part of the American Mafia ( or Cosa Nostra ) . Since its inception in the early 20th century , it has spread throughout Southern California . Like most Mafia families in the United States , the L.A. crime family gained power bootlegging alcohol during the Prohibition Era . The L.A. family reached its peak strength in the 1940s and early 1950s under Jack Dragna , who was on The Commission , although the L.A. family was never larger than the New York or Chicago families . Since Jack Dragna 's death , the Los Angeles crime family has been on a gradual decline , with the Chicago Outfit representing them on The Commission . The sources for much of the current information on the history of the Los Angeles Cosa Nostra family is the courtroom testimony and the published biographies of Aladena Jimmy the Weasel Fratianno , who in the late 1970s became the second member-and the first acting boss-in American Mafia history to testify against Mafia members , and The Last Mafioso ( 1981 ) , a biography of Fratianno by Ovid Demaris . Since the 1980s , the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO Act ) has been effective in convicting mobsters and shrinking the American Mafia ; like all families in the United States , the L.A. Mafia now only holds a fraction of its former power .

Its most prominent member during this time was its underboss Albert Anastasia , who rose to infamy as the operating head of the underworld 's enforcement arm , Murder , Inc . He remained in power even after Murder , Inc. was smashed in the late 1940s , and took over his family in 1951 - by all accounts , after murdering the family 's founder Vincent Mangano . The rise of what was the most powerful crime family in America for a time began in 1957 , when Anastasia was assassinated while sitting in a barber chair at the Park Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan . Experts believe that Anastasia 's underboss Carlo Gambino helped orchestrate the hit to take over the family . Gambino partnered with Meyer Lansky to control gambling interests in Cuba .
