He was the gold medalist in the event at the 2011 Pan American Games . He represented his country at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics .",
  "/wiki/800_metres": "The 800 metres , or 800 meters ( US spelling ) , is a common track running event . It is the shortest common middle-distance running event . The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track ( 400-metre track ) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896 . During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track , therefore requiring four laps . The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile ( 880 yards ) , a traditional English racing distance . Imperial racing distances were common in the United States . American high schools ( in the name of the NFHS ) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980 , following the NCAA 's conversion in 1976 . Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the 1966 Commonwealth Games . 800 m is 4.67 m less than half a mile . The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed . Both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are being taxed to a high extent , thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems . Runners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the 400 metres or the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay but only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m. If they are so inclined , 400 m runners are usually encouraged to run the 200 metres while 800 m runners are encouraged to run the 1500 metres or long distance events .",

Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea , Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean meet . It is east of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula ( Mexico ) , south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas , west of Haiti and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands . Havana is the largest city and capital ; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camag\u00fcey . The area of the Republic of Cuba is 110,860 square kilometers ( 42,800 sq mi ) ( 109,884 square kilometers ( 42,426 sq mi ) without the territorial waters ) . The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean , with an area of 105,006 square kilometers ( 40,543 sq mi ) , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola , with over 11 million inhabitants . The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Ta\u00edno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century . From the 15th century , it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish-American War of 1898 , when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902 . As a fragile republic , in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system , but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952 . Open corruption and oppression under Batista 's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement , which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro . Since 1965 , the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba . The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States , and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 .",

  "/wiki/The_Bahamas": "The Bahamas ( /b\u0259\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0m\u0259z/ ( listen ) ) , known officially as the Commonwealth of The Bahamas , is a country within the Lucayan Archipelago in the West Indies . It is a member of the Commonwealth Realms under the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II . The archipelagic state consists of more than 700 islands , cays , and islets in the Atlantic Ocean , and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola Island ( Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands , southeast of the U.S. state of Florida , and east of the Florida Keys . The capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force describes the Bahamas ' territory as encompassing 470,000 km2 ( 180,000 sq mi ) of ocean space . The Bahamas were inhabited by the Lucayans , a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno people , for many centuries . Columbus was the first European to see the islands , making his first landfall in the 'New World ' in 1492 . Later , the Spanish shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on Hispaniola , after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera . The Bahamas became a British crown colony in 1718 , when the British clamped down on piracy . After the American Revolutionary War , the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists to the Bahamas ; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants . African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on . The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807 ; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834 .",

  "/wiki/Racewalking": "Racewalking , or race walking , is a long-distance discipline within the sport of athletics . Although it is a foot race , it is different from running in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times . This is assessed by race judges . Typically held on either roads or on running tracks , common distances range from 3,000 metres ( 1.9 mi ) up to 100 kilometres ( 62.1 mi ) . There are two racewalking distances contested at the Summer Olympics : the 20 kilometres race walk ( men and women ) and 50 kilometres race walk ( men only ) . Both are held as road events . The biennial World Athletics Championships also features these three events , in addition to a 50 km walk for women . The IAAF World Race Walking Cup , first held in 1961 , is a stand-alone global competition for the discipline and it has 10 kilometres race walks for junior athletes , in addition to the Olympic-standard events . The IAAF World Indoor Championships featured 5000 m and 3000 m race walk variations , but these were discontinued after 1993 . Top level athletics championships and games typically feature 20 km racewalking events . The sport emerged from a British culture of long-distance competitive walking known as pedestrianism , which began to develop the ruleset that is the basis of the modern discipline around the mid-19th century . Since the mid-20th century onwards , Russian and Chinese athletes have been among the most successful on the global stage , with Europe and parts of Latin America producing most of the remaining top level walkers .",

Ecuador also includes the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in the Pacific , about 1,000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) west of the mainland . The capital city is Quito , which is also its largest city . The territories of modern-day Ecuador were once home to a variety of Amerindian groups that were gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century . The territory was colonized by Spain during the 16th century , achieving independence in 1820 as part of Gran Colombia , from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830 . The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador 's ethnically diverse population , with most of its 17.1 million people being mestizos , followed by large minorities of European , Amerindian , and African descendants . Spanish is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population , though 13 Amerindian languages are also recognized , including Quichua and Shuar . The sovereign state of Ecuador is a middle-income representative democratic republic with a developing economy that is highly dependent on commodities , namely petroleum and agricultural products . It is governed as a democratic presidential republic . One of 18 megadiverse countries in the world , Ecuador hosts many endemic plants and animals , such as those of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands . In recognition of its unique ecological heritage , the new constitution of 2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable Rights of Nature , or ecosystem rights . It also has the fifth lowest homicide rate in the Americas .",

For the race , ten hurdles of a height of 83.8 centimetres ( 33.0 in ) are placed along a straight course of 100 metres ( 109.36 yd ) . The first hurdle is placed after a run-up of 13 metres from the starting line . The next 9 hurdles are set at a distance of 8.5 metres from each other , and the home stretch from the last hurdle to the finish line is 10.5 metres long . The hurdles are set up so that they will fall over if bumped into by the runner , but weighted so this is disadvantageous . Fallen hurdles do not count against runners provided that they do not run into them on purpose . Like the 100 metres sprint , the 100 m hurdles begins with athletes in starting blocks . The fastest 100 m hurdlers run the distance in a time of around 12.5 seconds . The world record set by Kendra Harrison stands at 12.20 seconds .",

Consisting of the main islands Trinidad and Tobago , and numerous much smaller islands , it is situated 130 kilometres ( 81 miles ) south of Grenada and 11 kilometres ( 6.8 miles ) off the coast of northeastern Venezuela . It shares maritime boundaries with Barbados to the northeast , Grenada to the northwest , Guyana to the southeast , and Venezuela to the south and west . The island of Trinidad was inhabited for centuries by native Amerindian peoples before becoming a colony in the Spanish Empire , following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1498 . Spanish governor Don Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Chac\u00f3n surrendered the island to a British fleet under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby in 1797 . During the same period , the island of Tobago changed hands among Spanish , British , French , Dutch and Courlander colonisers more times than any other island in the Caribbean . [ citation needed ] Trinidad and Tobago were ceded to Britain in 1802 under the Treaty of Amiens as separate states and unified in 1889 . Trinidad and Tobago obtained independence in 1962 , becoming a republic in 1976 . Trinidad and Tobago has the third highest GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity ( PPP ) in the Americas after the United States and Canada . It is recognised by the World Bank as a high-income economy . Unlike most Caribbean nations and territories , which rely heavily on tourism , the Trinidadian economy is primarily industrial with an emphasis on petroleum and petrochemicals ; much of the nation 's wealth is derived from its large reserves of oil and natural gas .",

The first runners must begin in the same stagger as for the individual 400 m race . A relay baton is carried by each runner . Prior to 2018 , the baton had to be passed within a 20 m changeover box , preceded by a 10-metre acceleration zone . With a rule change effective November 1 , 2017 that zone was modified to include the acceleration zone as part of the passing zone , making the entire zone 30 metres in length . The outgoing runner can not touch the baton until it has entered the zone , the incoming runner can not touch the baton after it has left the zone . The zone is usually marked in yellow , frequently using lines , triangles or chevrons . While the rule book specifies the exact positioning of the marks , the colors and style are only recommended . While most legacy tracks will still have the older markings , the rule change still uses existing marks . Not all governing body jurisdictions have adopted the rule change . Transfer of the baton in this race is typically blind . The outgoing runner reaches a straight arm backwards when they enter the changeover box , or when the incoming runner makes a verbal signal .",
