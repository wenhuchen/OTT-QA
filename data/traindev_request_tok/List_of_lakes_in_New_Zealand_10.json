  "/wiki/Kahurangi_National_Park": "Kahurangi National Park in the northwest of the South Island of New Zealand is the second largest of the thirteen national parks of New Zealand . It was gazetted in 1996 and covers 4,529 square kilometres ( 1,749 sq mi ) , ranging to near Golden Bay in the north . Much of what was the North-west Nelson Forest Park formed the basis of the new park . Kahurangi Point , regarded as the boundary between the West Coast and Tasman Regions , is located in the park , as are the Heaphy Track and Mount Owen . The park is administered by the Department of Conservation . Tramping , rafting and caving are popular activities in the park . After being prohibited for several years , mountainbiking was allowed on the Heaphy Track on a trial basis for the winters of 2011 , 2012 and 2013 . The effect of the cyclists on trampers and the wildlife were to determine whether the trial continued or not .",

The lake is drained via an underground river into Rotomairewhenua / Blue Lake . In August 2014 , the official name for Lake Constance was altered to Rotop\u014dhueroa / Lake Constance , following the Ng\u0101ti Apa ki te R\u0101 T\u014d Treaty of Waitangi settlement with the Crown .",
  "/wiki/Abel_Tasman_National_Park": "Abel Tasman National Park is a New Zealand national park located between Golden Bay and Tasman Bay at the north end of the South Island .

  "/wiki/Cobb_Reservoir": "The Cobb Reservoir , surrounded by Kahurangi National Park and fed by the Cobb River , is in the South Island of New Zealand . The reservoir feeds the Cobb Power Station and is 819 metres ( 2,687 ft ) above sea level but drops significantly with low rainfall . Cobb Reservoir is the highest hydro storage lake in New Zealand . The dam that forms the reservoir was built from 1949 to 1954 , replacing a smaller structure built about ten years earlier . It is an earth dam 32 metres ( 105 ft ) high by 221 metres ( 725 ft ) long . The geology of the area precluded the construction of a concrete dam . A narrow winding road leads over Cobb Ridge to Cobb Reservoir and along the lake 's shore , providing access to tramping tracks in the area surrounding the valley . The road was built in the 1940s and remains unsealed from Cobb Power Station onwards .",
  "/wiki/Tasman_District": "Tasman District ( M\u0101ori : Te Tai o Aorere ) is a local government district in the north of the South Island of New Zealand . It borders the Canterbury Region , West Coast Region , Marlborough Region and Nelson City . It is administered by the Tasman District Council , a unitary authority , which sits at Richmond , with community boards serving outlying communities in Motueka and Golden Bay / Mohua . The city of Nelson has its own unitary authority separate from Tasman District , and together they comprise a single region in some contexts , but not for local government functions or resource management ( planning ) functions .",
  "/wiki/Lake_Rotoroa_(Tasman)": "Lake Rotoroa lies within the borders of Nelson Lakes National Park in the South Island , New Zealand . The lake is fed by the D'Urville and Sabine rivers . The greatest depth is 145 metres and the lake is completely surrounded by beech forest . Rotoroa is a small community at the base of the lake . The Gowan River flows out of the lake at this point , thus making the lake one of the sources of the Buller River system . A track follows the northeast side of the lake and a water taxi travels the length of the lake to ferry trampers to and from the tracks at the head of the lake . The lake has introduced trout , which attract recreational fishermen . [ citation needed ] There is a fly-fishing lodge , Lake Rotoroa Lodge , on the lake . The word rotoroa is M\u0101ori for long lake .",
  "/wiki/Lake_Rotoiti_(Tasman)": "Lake Rotoiti , previously also known as Lake Arthur , is a lake in the Tasman Region of New Zealand .

The lake is surrounded by Beech forest and is 82 metres deep . Saint Arnaud is a small community at the northern end of the lake . The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of little lake for Rotoiti . The first European to see the lake was John Sylvanus Cotterell on 18 January 1843 . Thomas Brunner and Charles Heaphy reached the lake in November 1843 , and Heaphy named it Lake Arthur after Captain Arthur Wakefield , but the M\u0101ori name remained . For many years the lake formed part of John Kerr of Nelson 's ( Politician & landowner ) , beloved Lake Station - including Mt Robert . Kerr ( who having introduced Trout to the lake ) , drowned there with many believing his son Robert to be responsible .

  "/wiki/Cirque": "A cirque ( French , from the Latin word circus ) is an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion . Alternative names for this landform are corrie ( from Scottish Gaelic coire , meaning a pot or cauldron ) and cwm ( Welsh for valley , pronounced [ k\u028am ] ) . A cirque may also be a similarly shaped landform arising from fluvial erosion . The concave shape of a glacial cirque is open on the downhill side , while the cupped section is generally steep . Cliff-like slopes , down which ice and glaciated debris combine and converge , form the three or more higher sides . The floor of the cirque ends up bowl-shaped as it is the complex convergence zone of combining ice flows from multiple directions and their accompanying rock burdens : hence it experiences somewhat greater erosion forces , and is most often overdeepened below the level of the cirque 's low-side outlet ( stage ) and its down slope ( backstage ) valley . If the cirque is subject to seasonal melting , the floor of the cirque most often forms a tarn ( small lake ) behind a dam which marks the downstream limit of the glacial overdeepening : the dam itself can be composed of moraine , glacial till , or a lip of the underlying bedrock . The fluvial cirque or makhtesh , found in karst landscapes , is formed by intermittent river flow cutting through layers of limestone and chalk leaving sheer cliffs . A common feature for all fluvial-erosion cirques is a terrain which includes erosion resistant upper structures overlying materials which are more easily eroded ."
