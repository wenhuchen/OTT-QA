Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 ( 1,073,500 sq mi ) , [ B ] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the fourth largest in the Americas , the second largest in South America after Brazil , and the largest Spanish-speaking nation . The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( Spanish : provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( Spanish : Capital Federal ) as decided by Congress . The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system . Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810-1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with several waves of European immigration , mainly Italians and Spaniards , radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook ; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry , and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture .",

After the Battle of San Lorenzo and time commanding the Army of the North during 1814 , he organized a plan to defeat the Spanish forces that menaced the United Provinces from the north , using an alternative path to the Viceroyalty of Peru . This objective first involved the establishment of a new army , the Army of the Andes , in Cuyo Province , Argentina . From there , he led the Crossing of the Andes to Chile , and triumphed at the Battle of Chacabuco and the Battle of Maip\u00fa ( 1818 ) , thus liberating Chile from royalist rule .

  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

Although Fleming received most of the credit for the discovery of penicillin , it was Florey who carried out the first ever clinical trials of penicillin in 1941 at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford on the first patient , a police constable from Oxford . The patient started to recover , but subsequently died because Florey was unable , at that time , to make enough penicillin . It was Florey and Chain who actually made a useful and effective drug out of penicillin , after the task had been abandoned as too difficult . Florey 's discoveries , along with the discoveries of Fleming and Ernst Chain , are estimated to have saved over 200 million lives , and he is consequently regarded by the Australian scientific and medical community as one of its greatest figures . Sir Robert Menzies , Australia 's longest-serving Prime Minister , said , In terms of world well-being , Florey was the most important man ever born in Australia .",

Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection . Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro .

The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries .

Dubbed the Apostle of Freedom , Levski ideologised and strategised a revolutionary movement to liberate Bulgaria from Ottoman rule . Levski founded the Internal Revolutionary Organisation , and sought to foment a nationwide uprising through a network of secret regional committees . Born in the Sub-Balkan town of Karlovo to middle-class parents , Levski became an Orthodox monk before emigrating to join the two Bulgarian Legions in Serbia and other Bulgarian revolutionary groups . Abroad , he acquired the nickname Levski , Lionlike . After working as a teacher in Bulgarian lands , he propagated his views and developed the concept of his Bulgaria-based revolutionary organisation , an innovative idea that superseded the foreign-based detachment strategy of the past . In Romania , Levski helped institute the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee , composed of Bulgarian expatriates . During his tours of Bulgaria , Levski established a wide network of insurrectionary committees . Ottoman authorities , however , captured him at an inn near Lovech and executed him by hanging in Sofia . Levski looked beyond the act of liberation : he envisioned a pure and sacred Bulgarian republic of ethnic and religious equality . His concepts have been described as a struggle for human rights , supposedly inspired by the progressive liberalism of the French Revolution and 19th century Western European society . Levski is commemorated with monuments in Bulgaria and Serbia , and numerous national institutions bear his name .",

The de jure end of Frankish rule was ratified by French and Aragonese monarchs in the Treaty of Corbeil in 1258 .

His long reign - the longest of any Iberian monarch - saw the expansion of the Crown of Aragon in three directions : Languedoc to the north , the Balearic Islands to the southeast , and Valencia to the south . By a treaty with Louis IX of France , he wrested the County of Barcelona from nominal French suzerainty and integrated it into his crown . He renounced northward expansion and taking back the once Catalan territories in Occitania and vassal counties loyal to the County of Barcelona , lands that were lost by his father Peter II of Aragon in the Battle of Muret during the Albigensian Crusade and annexed by the Kingdom of France , and then decided to turn south . His great part in the Reconquista was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia . One of the main reasons for this formal renunciation of most of the once Catalan territories in Languedoc and Occitania and any expansion into them is the fact that he was raised by the Knights Templar crusaders , who had defeated his father fighting for the Pope alongside the French , so it was effectively forbidden for him to try to maintain the traditional influence of the Count of Barcelona that previously existed in Occitania and Languedoc . As a legislator and organiser , he occupies a high place among the European kings . James compiled the Llibre del Consolat de Mar , which governed maritime trade and helped establish Aragonese supremacy in the western Mediterranean .

Colombia is bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea , the northwest by Panama , the south by both Ecuador and Peru , the east by Venezuela , the southeast by Brazil , and the west by the Pacific . It comprises thirty-two departments , with the capital in Bogot\u00e1 . Colombia is ethnically and linguistically diverse , with its rich cultural heritage reflecting influences by various Amerindian civilizations , European settlement , forced African labor , and immigration from Europe and the greater Middle East . Urban centres are concentrated in the Andean highlands and the Caribbean coast . Colombia has been inhabited by various American Indian peoples since at least 12,000 BCE , including the Muisca , Quimbaya , and the Tairona . Spaniards arrived in 1499 and by the mid-16th century annexed part of the region , establishing the New Kingdom of Granada , with Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 as its capital . Independence from Spain was achieved in 1819 , but by 1830 the Gran Colombia Federation was dissolved , with what is now Colombia and Panama emerging as the Republic of New Granada . The new sovereign state experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 . Panama seceded in 1903 , leading to Colombia 's present borders . Beginning in the 1960s , the country suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence , both of which escalated in the 1990s . Since 2005 , there has been significant improvement in security , stability , and rule of law .",

Following the failure of Republika Pukani\u0107 returned to the magazine as an investigative reporter . Shortly after the 2008 assassination of Ivo Pukani\u0107 , the magazine 's sales plummeted , and in 2010 it was bought by a Swiss media company owned by Harald von Seefried . Soon after the acquisition a group of journalists dissatisfied by the new owner 's editorial policies left Nacional to found a rival weekly called Aktual , whose first issue was published in June 2011 .

Yle shares many of its organizational characteristics with its UK counterpart , the BBC , on which it was largely modelled .
