It was founded by team owner Sir Frank Williams and automotive engineer Sir Patrick Head . It is still run by Williams . The team was formed in 1977 after Frank Williams 's two earlier unsuccessful F1 operations : Frank Williams Racing Cars ( 1969 to 1975 ) and Wolf-Williams Racing ( 1976 ) . All of Williams F1 chassis are called FW then a number , the FW being the initials of team owner , Frank Williams . The team 's first race was the 1977 Spanish Grand Prix , where the new team ran a March chassis for Patrick N\u00e8ve . Williams started manufacturing its own cars the following year , and Switzerland 's Clay Regazzoni won Williams 's first race at the 1979 British Grand Prix . At the 1997 British Grand Prix , Canadian Jacques Villeneuve scored the team 's 100th race victory , making Williams one of only four teams in Formula One , alongside Ferrari , fellow British team McLaren , and Mercedes to win 100 races .

  "/wiki/BMW_in_Formula_One": "BMW has been involved in Formula One in a number of capacities since the inauguration of the World Drivers ' Championship in 1950 . The company entered occasional races in the 1950s and 1960s ( often under Formula Two regulations ) , before building the BMW M12/13 inline-four turbocharged engine in the 1980s . This engine was the result of a deal between BMW and Brabham , which resulted in the team 's chassis being powered by BMW engines from 1982 until 1987 , a period in which Nelson Piquet won the 1983 championship driving a Brabham BT52-BMW . BMW also supplied the M12/13 on a customer basis to the ATS , Arrows , Benetton and Ligier teams during this period , with various degrees of success . In 1988 , Brabham temporarily withdrew from the sport and BMW withdrew its official backing from the engines , which were still used by the Arrows team under the Megatron badge . Turbocharged engines were banned by the revised Formula One Technical Regulations for 1989 , rendering the M12/13 obsolete . BMW decided to return to Formula One in the late 1990s by signing an exclusive contract with the Williams team , which needed a new long-term engine supplier after the withdrawal of Renault in 1997 . The programme resulted in the creation of a new V10 engine which made its race d\u00e9but in the Williams FW22 in 2000 . The following year saw the partnership move from the midfield to challenging for race victories , but the desired championship remained elusive due to the dominance of Michael Schumacher and Ferrari in the first half of the 2000s . By 2005 , the relationship between BMW and Williams had deteriorated , and BMW chose to part company and buy the rival Sauber team outright . The BMW Sauber project lasted from 2006 until 2009 , and resulted in a substantial increase in competitiveness for the Swiss former privateer team . Two podium finishes in the first year were followed by a solid third in the Constructors ' Championship in 2007 ( which became second when McLaren was disqualified ) .",

In 1981 , McLaren merged with Ron Dennis ' Project Four Racing ; Dennis took over as team principal and shortly after organised a buyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team . This began the team 's most successful era : with Porsche and Honda engines , Niki Lauda , Alain Prost , and Ayrton Senna took between them seven Drivers ' Championships and the team took six Constructors ' Championships . The combination of Prost and Senna was particularly dominant - together they won all but one race in 1988 - but later their rivalry soured and Prost left for Ferrari .

It was founded in 1996 for the purpose of supplying engines to the Sauber Formula One team but at the same time the company began work on the design of production car engines for the Malaysian national car company Proton . The company also helped develop racing motorcycles like Petronas GP1 . Former Honda and Ferrari engineer Osamu Goto was in charge of the Powertrain Division , including the F1 engine program . The engines were for many years nearly identical to the ones used by Ferrari but were branded Petronas . Sauber licensed nearly every legally licensable part from Ferrari and even had several Ferrari engineers on staff . Many pointed out suspicious similarities between Ferrari and Sauber chassis , but no formal accusations were ever made , even if FIA rules require each team to design their own chassis . The long-term aim of Sauber Petronas was to design and build its own F1 engines for the 1999 season but the programme was abandoned , choosing instead to continue with the Ferrari units . In 1998 , Petronas commissioned the Powertrain Division of SPE to design their own first commercial automotive engine , the Petronas E01e engine . After the 2005 season , Sauber was bought by BMW and the co-operation with Ferrari ended .",
