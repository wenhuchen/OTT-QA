  "/wiki/Mile_High_Stadium": "Mile High Stadium ( originally Bears Stadium ) was an outdoor multi-purpose stadium located in Denver , Colorado . The stadium was built in 1948 to accommodate the Denver Bears baseball team , which was a member of the Western League during its construction . Originally designed as a baseball venue , the stadium was expanded in later years to accommodate the addition of a professional football team to the city , the Denver Broncos , as well as to improve Denver 's hopes of landing a Major League Baseball team . Although the stadium was originally built as a baseball-specific venue , it became more popular as a pro-football stadium despite hosting both sports for a majority of its life . The Broncos called Mile High Stadium home from their beginning in the AFL in 1960 until 2000 . The Bears , who changed their name to the Zephyrs in 1985 , continued to play in the stadium until 1992 when the franchise was moved to New Orleans . The move was precipitated by the awarding of a Major League Baseball franchise to the city of Denver , and in 1993 the Colorado Rockies season opened in Mile High . The team played the 1993 and strike-shortened 1994 seasons in Mile High setting MLB attendance records while Coors Field was being constructed in downtown Denver . In addition to the Broncos , Bears/Zephyrs , and Rockies , Mile High Stadium was home to several other professional teams during the course of its history . The Denver Gold of the United States Football League called Mile High home from 1983 to 1985 , and the stadium played host to the inaugural USFL championship game on July 17 , 1983 . Two professional soccer teams also played at Mile High . The first was the Denver Dynamos of the North American Soccer League , who were founded in 1974 and played their first two seasons in Denver before moving to Bloomington , Minnesota and becoming the Minnesota Kicks .",

  "/wiki/Yankee_Stadium_(1923)": "The original Yankee Stadium was a stadium located in the Bronx , New York City .

It was also the home of the New York Giants National Football League ( NFL ) team from 1956 through the first part of the 1973-74 NFL season .

It has often been referred to as The Cathedral of Baseball . The stadium was built from 1922 to 1923 for $ 2.4 million ( $ 33.9 million in 2016 dollars ) . Its construction was paid for entirely by Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert , who was eager to have his own stadium after sharing the Polo Grounds with the New York Giants baseball team the previous 10 years . Yankee Stadium opened for the 1923 MLB season and was hailed at the time as a one-of-a-kind facility in the country for its size . Over the course of its history , Yankee Stadium became one of the most famous venues in the United States , having hosted a variety of events and historic moments during its existence . While many of these moments were baseball-related - including World Series games , no-hitters , perfect games and historic home runs - the stadium also hosted boxing matches , the 1958 NFL Championship Game ( referred to as The Greatest Game Ever Played ) , concerts , Jehovah 's Witnesses conventions ( see record attendance ) , and three Papal Masses .
