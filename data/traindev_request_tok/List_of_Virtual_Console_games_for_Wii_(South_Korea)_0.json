  "/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(video_game)": "Donkey Kong [ b ] is an arcade game released by Nintendo in 1981 . An early example of the platform game genre , the gameplay focuses on maneuvering the main character across a series of platforms while dodging and jumping over obstacles . In the game , Mario ( originally named Mr. Video and then Jumpman ) must rescue a damsel in distress named Pauline ( originally named Lady ) , from a giant ape named Donkey Kong . The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo 's most popular and recognizable characters . Donkey Kong is one of the most important games from the golden age of arcade video games as well as one of the most popular and greatest arcade games of all time . The game was the latest in a series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the North American market . Hiroshi Yamauchi , Nintendo 's president at the time , assigned the project to a first-time video game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto . Drawing from a wide range of inspirations , including Popeye , Beauty and the Beast , and King Kong , Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo 's chief engineer , Gunpei Yokoi . The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization , including cutscenes to advance the game 's plot and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay . Although Nintendo 's American staff was initially apprehensive , Donkey Kong succeeded commercially and critically in North America and Japan . Nintendo licensed the game to Coleco , who developed home console versions for numerous platforms . Other companies cloned Nintendo 's hit and avoided royalties altogether .",

It is the second game in the Kirby series after Kirby 's Dream Land ( 1992 ) on the Game Boy and the first to include the copy ability , which allows the main character Kirby to gain new powers by eating certain enemies . The game centers around Kirby traveling across Dream Land to repair the Star Rod after King Dedede breaks it apart and gives the pieces to his minions . Masahiro Sakurai returned as director after serving the same role for Kirby 's Dream Land . He conceived the copy ability to add more challenge and replay value after the last game received criticism for its simplicity .

Kirby 's Adventure is the first game to depict Kirby in color . Sakurai had always planned him to be pink , much to the surprise of other staff . Kirby 's Adventure was well received and commended for its tight controls , level variety , and the new copy ability .

The game is the product of a circle of influences following the breakthrough success of Super Mario Bros. ( 1985 ) . The sequel prototype is based on two cooperative players lifting and throwing each other , lifting and stacking objects , and scrolling the screen upward - a design too complex for the Famicom hardware and with dissatisfying gameplay .
