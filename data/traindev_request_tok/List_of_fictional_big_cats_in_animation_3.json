  "/wiki/Tiger": "The tiger ( Panthera tigris ) is the largest species among the Felidae and classified in the genus Panthera . It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orangish-brown fur with a lighter underside . It is an apex predator , primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar . It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator , requiring large contiguous areas of habitat , which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring . Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years , before they become independent and leave their mother 's home range to establish their own . The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin , and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands . Since the early 20th century , tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia , from the islands of Java and Bali , and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China . Today 's tiger range is fragmented , stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra . The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986 . As of 2015 , the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals , down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century , with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other . Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction , habitat fragmentation and poaching . This , coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more densely populated places on Earth , has caused significant conflicts with humans .",

Uncle Grandpa is also a spin-off of Secret Mountain Fort Awesome , which was in turn a spin-off of the Cartoonstitute short . It was produced by Cartoon Network Studios . The show is a surreal action-adventure comedy that relies extensively on visual gags and catchphrases . Creator Pete Browngardt has cited the work of cartoonists Don Martin , Gary Larson and Robert Crumb , as well as Golden Age-era animators such as Tex Avery and Max Fleischer when it came to developing the style of the show . Each 11-minute episode is presented in a unique format , consisting of a main seven- to nine-minute story , some short bumpers typically composed of a quick visual joke , and an original short that focuses on the show 's side characters . Cartoon Network renewed the series for the fourth and fifth seasons : first splitting the second season ( of 52 episodes ) into two halves , which respectively became the second and third season , then also dividing in half the already announced third season into the fourth and fifth season ( of 26 and 23 episodes , respectively ) , which served as the final seasons .",
