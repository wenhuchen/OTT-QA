After a tumultuous adolescence , Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the Chick Webb Orchestra , performing across the country but most often associated with the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem .

After taking over the band when Webb died , Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start her solo career . Her manager was Moe Gale , co-founder of the Savoy , until she turned the rest of her career over to Norman Granz , who founded Verve Records to produce new records by Fitzgerald . With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works , particularly her interpretations of the Great American Songbook . While Fitzgerald appeared in movies and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century , her musical collaborations with Louis Armstrong , Duke Ellington , and The Ink Spots were some of her most notable acts outside of her solo career . These partnerships produced some of her best-known songs such as Dream a Little Dream of Me , Cheek to Cheek , Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall , and It Do n't Mean a Thing ( If It Ai n't Got That Swing ) . In 1993 , after a career of nearly 60 years , she gave her last public performance . Three years later , she died at the age of 79 after years of declining health .

According to Torm\u00e9 , the song was written during a blistering hot summer . In an effort to stay cool by thinking cool , the most-performed ( according to BMI ) Christmas song was born . I saw a spiral pad on his ( Wells 's ) piano with four lines written in pencil , Torm\u00e9 recalled . They started , 'Chestnuts roasting. , Jack Frost nipping. , Yuletide carols. , Folks dressed up like Eskimos . ' Bob did n't think he was writing a song lyric . He said he thought if he could immerse himself in winter he could cool off . Forty minutes later that song was written . I wrote all the music and some of the lyrics . The Nat King Cole Trio first recorded the song in June 1946 . At Cole 's behest - and over the objections of his label , Capitol Records - a second recording was made in August utilizing a small string section , this version becoming a massive hit on both the pop and R & B charts . Cole again recorded the song in 1953 , using the same arrangement with a full orchestra arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle , and once more in 1961 , in a stereophonic version with another full orchestra arranged and conducted by Ralph Carmichael .",
