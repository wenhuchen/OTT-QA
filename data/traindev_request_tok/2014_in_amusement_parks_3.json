  "/wiki/Water_slide": "A water slide ( also referred to as a flume , or water chute ) is a type of slide designed for warm-weather or indoor recreational use at water parks . Water slides differ in their riding method and therefore size . Some slides require riders to sit directly on the slide , or on a raft or tube designed to be used with the slide . A typical water slide uses a pump system to pump water to the top which is then allowed to freely flow down its surface . The water reduces friction so sliders travel down the slide very quickly . Water slides run into a swimming pool ( often called a plunge pool ) or a long run-out chute . A lifeguard is usually stationed at the top and the bottom of the slide , so that if a rider gets hurt they will be treated immediately .",

  "/wiki/Drop_tower": "A drop tower or big drop is a type of amusement ride incorporating a central structure or tower . Drop towers vary in height , passenger capacity , lift type , and brake type . Many are custom-made , although there are some mass-produced designs . Riders experience free-fall initially , followed by rapid heavy deceleration . With most drop towers , a gondola carrying riders is lifted to the top of a large vertical structure , then released to free-fall down the tower . Brakes activate to slow the gondola as it approaches the bottom of the ride . Some designs expand on this concept with features such as rotating gondolas , or several bounces before coming to rest . Most drop towers require child riders to exceed a minimum height ; limits vary widely depending upon the nature of the tower , with a 30-foot ( 9 m ) tower for smaller children from 37 inches ( 95 cm ) tall , and a 115-foot ( 35 m ) tower having a 51-inch ( 130 cm ) restriction . Drop towers use a magnetic braking system to slow the carriage quickly and smoothly once it reaches the bottom of the tower . This system is fail-safe because magnets do not need to be powered by electricity or other sources ; they work intrinsically by the laws of magnetism .",
