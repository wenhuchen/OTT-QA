If made of suitable material or textile , some undergarments can serve as nightwear or swimsuits , and some are intended for sexual attraction or visual appeal . Undergarments are generally of two types , those that are worn to cover the torso and those that are worn to cover the waist and legs , although there are also garments which cover both . Different styles of undergarments are generally worn by females and males .

[ b ] His extant works , including collaborations , consist of some 39 plays , [ c ] 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613 . [ d ] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres .",

His influence on Western theatre , culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond . He wrote more than sixty plays , including major works such as Man and Superman ( 1902 ) , Pygmalion ( 1912 ) and Saint Joan ( 1923 ) . With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory , Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation , and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature . Born in Dublin , Shaw moved to London in 1876 , where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist , and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education . By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic . Following a political awakening , he joined the gradualist Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer . Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success , Arms and the Man in 1894 . Influenced by Henrik Ibsen , he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama , using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political , social and religious ideas . By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included Major Barbara , The Doctor 's Dilemma and Caesar and Cleopatra . Shaw 's expressed views were often contentious ; he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform , and opposed vaccination and organised religion . He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable , and although not a republican , castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period .",

As one of the founders of modernism in theatre , Ibsen is often referred to as the father of realism and one of the most influential playwrights of his time . His major works include Brand , Peer Gynt , An Enemy of the People , Emperor and Galilean , A Doll 's House , Hedda Gabler , Ghosts , The Wild Duck , When We Dead Awaken , Rosmersholm , and The Master Builder . He is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after Shakespeare , and A Doll 's House was the world 's most performed play in 2006 . Ibsen 's early poetic and cinematic play Peer Gynt has strong surreal elements . After Peer Gynt Ibsen abandoned verse and wrote in realistic prose . Several of his later dramas were considered scandalous to many of his era , when European theatre was expected to model strict morals of family life and propriety . Ibsen 's later work examined the realities that lay behind the facades , revealing much that was disquieting to a number of his contemporaries . He had a critical eye and conducted a free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality . In many critics ' estimates The Wild Duck and Rosmersholm are vying with each other as rivals for the top place among Ibsen 's works ; Ibsen himself regarded Emperor and Galilean as his masterpiece .

[ a ] It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake . Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I , who was patron of Shakespeare 's acting company , Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright 's relationship with his sovereign . It was first published in the Folio of 1623 , possibly from a prompt book , and is Shakespeare 's shortest tragedy . A brave Scottish general named Macbeth receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland . Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife , Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the Scottish throne for himself . He is then wracked with guilt and paranoia . Forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion , he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler . The bloodbath and consequent civil war swiftly take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into the realms of madness and death . Shakespeare 's source for the story is the account of Macbeth , King of Scotland , Macduff , and Duncan in Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) , a history of England , Scotland , and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries , although the events in the play differ extensively from the history of the real Macbeth . The events of the tragedy are usually associated with the execution of Henry Garnet for complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 . In the backstage world of theatre , some believe that the play is cursed , and will not mention its title aloud , referring to it instead as The Scottish Play .",

His first plays were written later than or contemporary with those of Aeschylus , and earlier than or contemporary with those of Euripides . Sophocles wrote over 120 plays during the course of his life , but only seven have survived in a complete form : Ajax , Antigone , Women of Trachis , Oedipus Rex , Electra , Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus . For almost 50 years , Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens that took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia . He competed in 30 competitions , won 24 , and was never judged lower than second place . Aeschylus won 13 competitions , and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles , while Euripides won four competitions . The most famous tragedies of Sophocles feature Oedipus and also Antigone : they are generally known as the Theban plays , although each play was actually a part of a different tetralogy , the other members of which are now lost . Sophocles influenced the development of drama , most importantly by adding a third actor , thereby reducing the importance of the chorus in the presentation of the plot . He also developed his characters to a greater extent than earlier playwrights such as Aeschylus ."
