  "/wiki/Porky_Pig": "Porky Pig is an animated character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons . He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power , and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character . Even after he was supplanted by later characters , Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and , more importantly , the Warners directors , who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles . He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts , Th-th-th-that 's all folks ! This slogan ( without stuttering ) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons . In contrast , the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan : So Long , Folks ! until the mid 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series ( when Bugs Bunny was the closing character , he would break the pattern by simply saying , in his Brooklynese accent , And Dat 's De End ! ) . He is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character . Porky 's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter , for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words ; for example , What 's going on ? might become What 's guh-guh-guh-guh - .what 's happening ? Porky 's age varied widely in the series ; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet ( explicitly mentioned as such in Porky 's Preview ) , Porky was more frequently cast as an adult , often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years . In the ending of many Looney Tunes cartoons , Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head , and his attempt to close the show with The End becomes Th-Th-The , Th-Th-The , Th-Th .",

  "/wiki/The_Honeymooners": "The Honeymooners is a classic American television sitcom created by and starring Jackie Gleason , based on a recurring comedy sketch of the same name that had been part of his variety show . It followed the day to day life of New York City bus driver Ralph Kramden ( Gleason ) , his wife Alice ( Audrey Meadows ) , and his best friend Ed Norton ( Art Carney ) as they get involved with various scenarios in their day to day living . Most episodes revolved around Ralph 's poor choices in absurd dilemmas which frequently showed his quick-to-judge attitude in a comedic tone , but also revolved around more serious issues such as women 's rights and social impressions . The sketches originally aired on the DuMont network 's variety series Cavalcade of Stars , which Gleason hosted , and subsequently on the CBS network 's The Jackie Gleason Show , which was broadcast live in front of a theater audience . The popularity of the sketches led Gleason to rework The Honeymooners as a filmed half-hour series , which debuted October 1 , 1955 , on CBS , in place of the variety series . It was initially a ratings success as the No . 2 show in the United States during its first season , facing stiff competition from The Perry Como Show on NBC . The show eventually dropped to No . 19 , ending its production after 39 episodes ( now referred to as the Classic 39 episodes ) . The final episode of The Honeymooners aired on September 22 , 1956 , although Gleason sporadically revived the characters until 1978 . The Honeymooners was one of the first U.S. television shows to portray working-class married couples in a gritty , non-idyllic manner , as the show is mostly set in the Kramdens ' kitchen in a neglected Brooklyn apartment building .",
