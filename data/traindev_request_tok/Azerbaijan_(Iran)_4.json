  "/wiki/Freeways": "A controlled-access highway is a type of highway that has been designed for high-speed vehicular traffic , with all traffic flow ingress- and egress-regulated . Common English terms are freeway ( in Australia , South Africa , United States and Canada ) , motorway ( in the United Kingdom , Pakistan , Ireland , New Zealand and parts of Australia ) and expressway ( parts of Canada , parts of the United States , India and many other Asian countries ) . Other similar terms include Interstate and throughway ( in the United States ) and parkway . Some of these may be limited-access highways , although this term can also refer to a class of highway with somewhat less isolation from other traffic . In countries following the Vienna convention , the motorway qualification implies that walking and parking are forbidden , and they are reserved for the use of motorized vehicles only . A controlled-access highway provides an unhindered flow of traffic , with no traffic signals , intersections or property access . They are free of any at-grade crossings with other roads , railways , or pedestrian paths , which are instead carried by overpasses and underpasses . Entrances and exits to the highway are provided at interchanges by slip roads ( ramps ) , which allow for speed changes between the highway and arterials and collector roads . On the controlled-access highway , opposing directions of travel are generally separated by a median strip or central reservation containing a traffic barrier or grass . Elimination of conflicts with other directions of traffic dramatically improves safety and capacity . Controlled-access highways evolved during the first half of the 20th century . Italy opened its first autostrada in 1924 , A8 , connecting Milan to Varese .",

Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty in 1786 , in order to remain within close reach of Iran 's territories in the Caucasus , before being separated from Iran as a result of the Russo-Iranian Wars , and to avoid the vying factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties . The capital has been moved several times throughout history , and Tehran is the 32nd national capital of Iran . Large-scale demolition and rebuilding began in the 1920s , and Tehran has been a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century . Tehran is home to many historical collections , including the royal complexes of Golestan , Sa'dabad , and Niavaran , where the two last dynasties of the former Imperial State of Iran were seated . Tehran 's most famous landmarks include the Azadi Tower , a memorial built under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1971 to mark the 2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran , and the Milad Tower , the world 's sixth-tallest self-supporting tower which was completed in 2007 .
