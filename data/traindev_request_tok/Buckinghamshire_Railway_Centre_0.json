  "/wiki/Metropolitan_Railway": "The Metropolitan Railway ( also known as the Met ) [ note 1 ] was a passenger and goods railway that served London from 1863 to 1933 , its main line heading north-west from the capital 's financial heart in the City to what were to become the Middlesex suburbs . Its first line connected the main-line railway termini at Paddington , Euston , and King 's Cross to the City . The first section was built beneath the New Road using cut-and-cover between Paddington and King 's Cross and in tunnel and cuttings beside Farringdon Road from King 's Cross to near Smithfield , near the City . It opened to the public on 10 January 1863 with gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives , the world 's first passenger-carrying designated underground railway . The line was soon extended from both ends , and northwards via a branch from Baker Street . Southern branches , directly served , reached Hammersmith in 1864 , Richmond in 1877 and the original completed the Inner Circle in 1884 . The most important route was northwest into the Middlesex countryside , stimulating the development of new suburbs . Harrow was reached in 1880 , and from 1897 , having achieved the early patronage of the Duke of Buckingham and the owners of Waddesdon Manor , services extended for many years to Verney Junction in Buckinghamshire . Electric traction was introduced in 1905 and by 1907 electric multiple units operated most of the services , though electrification of outlying sections did not occur until decades later . Unlike other railway companies in the London area , the Met developed land for housing , and after World War I promoted housing estates near the railway using the Metro-land brand . On 1 July 1933 , the Met was amalgamated with the Underground Electric Railways Company of London and the capital 's tramway and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board . Former Met tracks and stations are used by the London Underground 's Metropolitan , Circle , District , Hammersmith & City , Piccadilly , Jubilee and Victoria lines , and by Chiltern Railways and Great Northern .",

  "/wiki/0-4-4": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives , 0-4-4 represents the wheel arrangement of no leading wheels , four powered and coupled driving wheels on two axles , and four trailing wheels on two axles . This type was only used for tank locomotives . In American cities , the type known as a Forney locomotive , was used on the narrow curves of elevated railways and other rapid transit lines . In the UK 0-4-4 tanks were mainly used for suburban or rural passenger duties .",
  "/wiki/Tank_locomotive": "A tank locomotive or tank engine is a steam locomotive that carries its water in one or more on-board water tanks , instead of a more traditional tender . A tank engine may also have a bunker ( or oil tank ) to hold fuel . There are several different types of tank locomotive , distinguished by the position and style of the water tanks and fuel bunkers . The most common type has tanks mounted either side of the boiler . This type originated about 1840 and quickly became popular for industrial tasks , and later for shunting and shorter distance main line duties . Tank locomotives have advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional tender locomotives .",
  "/wiki/Epping_Ongar_Railway": "The Epping Ongar Railway is a heritage railway in south-west Essex , England , run by a small number of paid staff and a team of volunteers . It was the final section of the Great Eastern Railway branch line , later the London Underground 's Central line from Loughton via Epping to Ongar , with intermediate stations at North Weald and Blake Hall . The line was closed by London Underground in 1994 and sold in 1998 . It reopened between 2004 and 2007 as a preserved railway , offering a volunteer-run Class 117 DMU service between Ongar and Coopersale . A change of ownership in 2007 led to the line being closed for restoration to a heritage steam railway , which opened on 25 May 2012 .",
  "/wiki/London_and_South_Western_Railway": "The London and South Western Railway ( LSWR or L & SWR ) was a railway company in England from 1838 to 1922 . Starting as the London and Southampton Railway , its network extended from London to Plymouth via Salisbury and Exeter , with branches to Ilfracombe and Padstow and via Southampton to Bournemouth and Weymouth . It also had many routes connecting towns in Hampshire and Berkshire , including Portsmouth and Reading . In the grouping of railways in 1923 the LSWR amalgamated with other railways to create the Southern Railway . Among significant achievements of the LSWR were the electrification of suburban lines , the introduction of power signalling , the development of Southampton Docks , the rebuilding of London Waterloo station as one of the great stations of the world , and the handling of the massive traffic involved in the First World War . Spreading car ownership led to a rapid decline of passenger traffic in Devon and Cornwall from about 1960 to the end of that decade so short mid-distance-from-London branches and the remote peninsular sections of route closed under the Beeching Report , except the line to Penzance from Exeter which had since the very outset been the main preserve of the Great Western Railway , chiefly due to that company 's initial laying of track there and doing so on broad gauge and encouraging Devon and Cornish companies to do so under the 'Gauge War ' .",

  "/wiki/British_Railways": "British Railways ( BR ) , which from 1965 traded as British Rail , was the state-owned company that operated most of the overground rail transport in Great Britain between 1948 and 1997 . It was formed from the nationalisation of the Big Four British railway companies and lasted until the gradual privatisation of British Rail , in stages between 1994 and 1997 . Originally a trading brand of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission , it became an independent statutory corporation in 1962 designated as the British Railways Board . The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network . A process of dieselisation and electrification took place , and by 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction , except for the Vale of Rheidol Railway ( a narrow-gauge tourist line ) . Passengers replaced freight as the main source of business , and one third of the network was closed by the Beeching Axe of the 1960s in an effort to reduce rail subsidies . On privatisation , responsibility for track , signalling and stations was transferred to Railtrack ( which was later brought under public control as Network Rail ) and that for trains to the train operating companies . The British Rail double arrow logo is formed of two interlocked arrows showing the direction of travel on a double track railway and was nicknamed the arrow of indecision . It is now employed as a generic symbol on street signs in Great Britain denoting railway stations , and as part of the Rail Delivery Group 's ( RDG ) jointly-managed National Rail brand is still printed on railway tickets .",

  "/wiki/0-4-0": "Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives , 0-4-0 represents one of the simplest possible types , that with two axles and four coupled wheels , all of which are driven . The wheels on the earliest four-coupled locomotives were connected by a single gear wheel , but from 1825 the wheels were usually connected with coupling rods to form a single driven set . The notation 0-4-0T indicates a tank locomotive of this wheel arrangement on which its water and fuel is carried on board the engine itself , rather than in an attached tender . In Britain , the Whyte notation of wheel arrangement was also often used for the classification of electric and diesel-electric locomotives with side-rod-coupled driving wheels . Under the UIC classification used in Europe and , in more recent years , in simplified form in the United States , an 0-4-0 is classified as B ( German and Italian ) if the axles are connected by side rods or gearing and 020 ( French ) , independent of axle motoring . The UIC 's Bo classification for electric and diesel-electric locomotives indicates that the axles are independently motored , which would be 0-2-2-0 under the Whyte notation .",

  "/wiki/North_British_Locomotive_Company": "The North British Locomotive Company ( NBL , NB Loco or North British ) was created in 1903 through the merger of three Glasgow locomotive manufacturing companies ; Sharp , Stewart and Company ( Atlas Works ) , Neilson , Reid and Company ( Hyde Park Works ) and D\u00fcbs and Company ( Queens Park Works ) , creating the largest locomotive manufacturing company in Europe and the British Empire . Its main factories were located at the neighbouring Atlas and Hyde Park Works in central Springburn , as well as the Queens Park Works in Polmadie . A new central Administration and Drawing Office for the combined company was completed across the road from the Hyde Park Works on Flemington Street by James Miller in 1909 , later sold to Glasgow Corporation in 1961 to become the main campus of North Glasgow College ( now Glasgow Kelvin College ) . The two other Railway works in Springburn were St. Rollox railway works , owned by the Caledonian Railway and Cowlairs railway works , owned by the North British Railway . Latterly both works were operated by British Rail Engineering Limited after rail nationalisation in 1948 . In 1918 NBL produced the first prototype of the Anglo-American Mark VIII battlefield tank for the Allied armies , but with the Armistice it did not go into production .",

  "/wiki/Fireless_locomotive": "A fireless locomotive is a type of locomotive which uses reciprocating engines powered from a reservoir of compressed air or steam , which is filled at intervals from an external source . They offer advantages over conventional steam locomotives of lower cost per unit , cleanliness , and decreased risk from fire or boiler explosion ; these are counterbalanced by the need for a source to refill the locomotive , and by the limited range afforded by the reservoir . Typical usage was in industrial switching where a conventional locomotive was too noxious or risky , such as in a mine or a food or chemical factory ; they also saw use where the source of air or steam was readily available . They were eventually displaced by diesel and battery electric locomotives fitted with protective appliances ; these are described as flame-proof locomotives .",
  "/wiki/Brill_Tramway": "The Brill Tramway , also known as the Quainton Tramway , Wotton Tramway , Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad and Metropolitan Railway Brill Branch , [ note 1 ] was a six-mile ( 10 km ) rail line in the Aylesbury Vale , Buckinghamshire , England . It was privately built in 1871 by the 3rd Duke of Buckingham as a horse tram line to help transport goods between his lands around Wotton House and the national rail network . Lobbying from the nearby village of Brill led to its extension to Brill and conversion to passenger use in early 1872 . Two locomotives were bought but the line had been built for horses and thus trains travelled at an average speed of 4 miles per hour ( 6.4 km/h ) . In 1883 , the Duke of Buckingham planned to upgrade the route to main line standards and extend the line to Oxford , creating the shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford . Despite the backing of the wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild , investors were deterred by costly tunnelling . In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling . In anticipation , the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad . Although the existing line had been upgraded in 1894 , the extension to Oxford was never built . Instead , operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London 's Metropolitan Railway and Brill became one of its two north-western termini . The line was rebuilt in 1910 , and more advanced locomotives were introduced , allowing trains to run faster . The population of the area remained low , and the primary income source remained the carriage of goods to and from farms .",

With 863 built , they were the most prolific class of the GWR , and one of the most numerous classes of British steam locomotive . [ a ] Although officially designated by GWR as light goods and shunting engines , they were also used for passenger working on branch , suburban , and shorter mainline journeys . They were distributed across most of the GWR network and , after nationalisation of the railways in 1948 , across the British Railways Western Region , and also other regions . The 5700s were not as glamorous as the GWR Castles and Kings , but became just as much of an icon of the GWR . As a result of the 1955 Modernisation Plan , the 5700 Class was withdrawn from BR service between 1956 and 1966 .
