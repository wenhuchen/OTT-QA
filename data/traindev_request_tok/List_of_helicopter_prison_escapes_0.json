In 1521 , the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its politically powerful base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan ( part of Mexico City ) , which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain . The Roman Catholic Church played a powerful role in governing the country as millions were converted to the faith , although King Charles III expelled the Jesuits in the 1770s . The territory became a nation state following its recognition in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence . The post-independence period was tumultuous , characterized by economic inequality and many contrasting political changes .",

  "/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency": "The Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States , tasked with gathering , processing , and analyzing national security information from around the world , primarily through the use of human intelligence ( HUMINT ) . As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community ( IC ) , the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States . Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , which is a domestic security service , the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering , with only limited domestic intelligence collection . Though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the United States specializing in HUMINT , the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community . Moreover , the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President . It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions , such as the Special Activities Center . The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries , such as Germany 's BND . Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 , the CIA Director concurrently served as the head of the Intelligence Community ; today , the CIA is organized under the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) . Despite transferring some of its powers to the DNI , the CIA has grown in size as a result of the September 11 attacks . In 2013 , The Washington Post reported that in the fiscal year 2010 , the CIA had the largest budget of all IC agencies , exceeding previous estimates . The CIA has increasingly expanded its role , including covert paramilitary operations . One of its largest divisions , the Information Operations Center ( IOC ) , has shifted focus from counter-terrorism to offensive cyber-operations .",

  "/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_America": "The Socialist Party of America ( SPA ) was a democratic socialist and social democratic political party in the United States formed in 1901 by a merger between the three-year-old Social Democratic Party of America and disaffected elements of the Socialist Labor Party of America which had split from the main organization in 1899 . In the first decades of the 20th century , it drew significant support from many different groups , including trade unionists , progressive social reformers , populist farmers and immigrants . However , it refused to form coalitions with other parties , or even to allow its members to vote for other parties . Eugene V. Debs twice won over 900,000 votes in presidential elections ( 1912 and 1920 ) while the party also elected two Representatives ( Victor L. Berger and Meyer London ) , dozens of state legislators , more than a hundred mayors and countless lesser officials . The party 's staunch opposition to American involvement in World War I , although welcomed by many , also led to prominent defections , official repression and vigilante persecution . The organization was further shattered by a factional war over how to respond to the October Revolution in Imperial Russia in 1917 and the establishment of the Communist International in 1919 - many members left the party in favor of the Communist Party USA . After endorsing Robert M. La Follette 's presidential campaign in 1924 , the party returned to independent action at the presidential level . It had modest growth in the early 1930s behind presidential candidate Norman Thomas . The party 's appeal was weakened by the popularity of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal , the organization and flexibility of the Communist Party under Earl Browder and the resurgent labor movement 's desire to support sympathetic Democratic Party politicians . A divisive and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to broaden the party by admitting followers of Leon Trotsky and Jay Lovestone caused the traditional Old Guard to leave and form the Social Democratic Federation . While the party was always strongly anti-fascist as well as anti-Stalinist , its opposition to American entry in World War II cost it both internal and external support . The party stopped running presidential candidates after 1956 , when its nominee Darlington Hoopes won fewer than 6,000 votes .",

  "/wiki/Action_film": "Action film is a film genre in which the protagonist or protagonists are thrust into a series of events that typically include violence , extended fighting , physical feats , and frantic chases . Action films tend to feature a resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds , which include life-threatening situations , a villain , or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for the hero ( though a small number of films in this genre have ended in the victory for the villain instead ) . Advancements in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past . However , reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed , as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic , highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism . While action has long been a recurring component in films , the action film genre began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and special effects . Common action scenes in films are generally , but not limited to , explosions , car chases , fistfights , and shootouts . This genre is closely associated with the thriller and adventure genres , and they may also contain elements of drama and spy fiction .",

The capital and largest city is Dublin , which is located on the eastern side of the island . Around a third of the country 's population of 4.9 million people resides in the greater Dublin area . The sovereign state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland , a part of the United Kingdom . It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the Celtic Sea to the south , St George 's Channel to the south-east , and the Irish Sea to the east . It is a unitary , parliamentary republic . The legislature , the Oireachtas , consists of a lower house , D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann , an upper house , Seanad \u00c9ireann , and an elected President ( Uachtar\u00e1n ) who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state , but with some important powers and duties . The head of government is the Taoiseach ( Prime Minister , literally 'Chief ' , a title not used in English ) , who is elected by the D\u00e1il and appointed by the President ; the Taoiseach in turn appoints other government ministers . The state was created as the Irish Free State in 1922 as a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . It had the status of Dominion until 1937 when a new constitution was adopted , in which the state was named Ireland and effectively became a republic , with an elected non-executive president as head of state .

It was the most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles . It saw itself as the sole legitimate successor to the original IRA from the Irish War of Independence , and accordingly referred to itself simply as the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) , or \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann in Irish . It was designated a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland . The Provisional IRA emerged in December 1969 , following a split within the previous incarnation of the IRA and the broader Irish republican movement . It was the minority faction in the split , while the majority continued as the Official IRA . The term provisional was chosen to mirror the 1916 Provisional Government of the Irish Republic , and also to designate it as temporary pending reorganisation of the movement . Although this reorganisation eventually happened in 1970 , the name stuck . The Troubles had begun shortly before when a largely Catholic , nonviolent civil rights campaign was met with violence from both Ulster loyalists and the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) , culminating in the August 1969 riots and deployment of British troops . The IRA initially focused on defence of Catholic areas , but it began an offensive campaign in 1971 ( see timeline ) . The IRA 's primary goal was to force the United Kingdom to negotiate a withdrawal from Northern Ireland . It used guerrilla tactics against the British Army and RUC in both rural and urban areas .",

The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering and allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they ordered others to do or assisted them in doing , closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to , for example , murder , to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally . RICO was enacted by section 901 ( a ) of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 ( Pub.L . 91-452 , 84 Stat . 922 , enacted October 15 , 1970 ) and is codified at 18 U.S.C . ch . 96 as 18 U.S.C . \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 .

It was enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 , and signed into law by Richard M. Nixon . While its original use in the 1970s was to prosecute the Mafia as well as others who were actively engaged in organized crime , its later application has been more widespread .
