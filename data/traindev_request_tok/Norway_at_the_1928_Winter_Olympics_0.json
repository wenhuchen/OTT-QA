Three figure skating events were contested : men 's singles , ladies ' singles , and pair skating . Unseasonably warm weather in St. Moritz during the Games caused difficulty for the figure skating events , as the ice surface was outdoors . There was a proposal to move the competition to an indoor rink in Berlin or London , but colder weather returned before a decision could be made . However , the ice surface remained in poor condition for the duration of the Games .

  "/wiki/Bernt_Evensen": "Bernt Sverre Evensen ( 18 April 1905 - 24 August 1979 ) was a Norwegian speed skater and racing cyclist who competed in skating at the 1928 and 1932 Winter Olympics . In 1928 he became the first Norwegian skater to win an Olympic gold medal by winning the 500 m event ( first place shared with Clas Thunberg ) . At the same Olympics , he also won silver in the 1500 m and bronze over 5,000 m. He was in second place in the 10,000 m event , 0.1 seconds behind Irving Jaffee , when the competition was cancelled because the ice had started thawing . At the 1932 Olympics in Lake Placid , Evensen won a silver medal in the 500 m. Evensen and compatriot Ivar Ballangrud were the only European Olympic speed skating medalists during those games . This can mostly be attributed to the fact that the races were skated in pack-style ( having all competitors skate at the same time ) , a format that most European skaters were not familiar with . At the World Allround Championships , Evensen finished first in 1927 and 1934 , second in 1931 , and third in 1926 , 1928 , and 1932 .

  "/wiki/Roald_Larsen": "Roald Morel Larsen ( 1 February 1898 - 28 July 1959 ) was a World Champion speed skater from Norway . He was born in Kristiania ( now Oslo ) .

Representing Kristiania Sk\u00f8iteklub ( now Oslo Sk\u00f8iteklub ) , Larsen had his best year in 1924 , when he became World Allround , European Allround , and Norwegian Allround Champion , in addition to winning two silver and three bronze medals at the 1924 Winter Olympics of Chamonix . One of those Olympic silver medals was on the allround event , a combination of the results of the 500 m , the 1500 m , the 5000 m , and the 10000 m - the only time in Olympic history that there was an allround event . Larsen won several more medals in the years that followed , including another bronze medal at the 1928 Winter Olympics of St. Moritz . Larsen often had to admit defeat to Clas Thunberg . This is illustrated by the fact that at none of the six events in which Larsen won an Olympic medal he managed to finish ahead of Thunberg . After 1928 , Larsen 's appearances and successes quickly became less , although he kept competing occasionally until 1936 . After retiring from speed skating , Larsen followed in his father 's footsteps and became a full-time glazier . He founded the glazier company Roald Larsen AS in Oslo in 1937 ."
