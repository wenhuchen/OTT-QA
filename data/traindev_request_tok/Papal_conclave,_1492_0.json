Born into the prominent Borgia family in X\u00e0tiva in the Crown of Aragon , Rodrigo studied law at the University of Bologna . He was ordained deacon and made a cardinal in 1456 after the election of his uncle as Pope Callistus III , and a year later he became vice-chancellor of the Catholic Church . He proceeded to serve in the Curia under the next four popes , acquiring significant influence and wealth in the process . In 1492 , Rodrigo was elected Pope , taking the name Alexander VI . Alexander 's bulls of 1493 confirmed or reconfirmed the rights of the Spanish crown in the New World following the finds of Christopher Columbus in 1492 . During the second Italian war , Alexander VI supported his son Cesare Borgia as a condottiero for the French King . The scope of his foreign policy was to gain the most advantageous terms for his family . Alexander is considered one of the most controversial of the Renaissance popes , partly because he acknowledged fathering several children by his mistresses . As a result , his Italianized Valencian surname , Borgia , became a byword for libertinism and nepotism , which are traditionally considered as characterizing his pontificate . On the other hand , two of Alexander 's successors , Sixtus V and Urban VIII , described him as one of the most outstanding popes since Saint Peter .",

When the Crown of Aragon merged by dynastic union with the Crown of Castile to form the Kingdom of Spain , the Kingdom of Valencia became a component realm of the Spanish monarchy . The Kingdom of Valencia was formally created in 1238 when the Moorish taifa of Valencia was taken in the course of the Reconquista . It was dissolved by Philip V of Spain in 1707 , by means of the Nueva Planta decrees , as a result of the Spanish War of Succession . During its existence , the Kingdom of Valencia was ruled by the laws and institutions stated in the Furs ( charters ) of Valencia which granted it wide self-government under the Crown of Aragon and , later on , under the Spanish Kingdom . The boundaries and identity of the present Spanish Autonomous Community of Valencia are essentially those of the former Kingdom of Valencia .",

It is most often used when there is a papal appointment to the College of Cardinals without a public announcement of the name of that cardinal . The pope reserves that name to himself . The Italian language version of the phrase - in petto - is sometimes used . When the name of a new cardinal is announced or made public , it is sometimes said to be published . Since the practice arose in the sixteenth century its use has varied greatly . Some popes have used it rarely or not at all , while others have used it regularly . In the first half of the 19th century , Pope Gregory XVI appointed half of his 75 cardinals in pectore and left several unidentified at his death .",

He is the most recent pope to have taken the pontifical name of Callixtus upon his election . A member of the powerful Borgia family , Callixtus III was the uncle of Pope Alexander VI , whom he appointed to the College of Cardinals . Borgia spent his early career as a professor of law at the University of Lleida ; he later served as a diplomat for the Kings of Aragon . He became a tutor for King Alfonso V 's illegitimate son Ferrante . After arranging a reconciliation between Alfonso and Pope Martin , Borgia was made Bishop of Valencia . In 1444 , Pope Eugene IV named him a cardinal , and Borgia became a member of the Roman Curia . Borgia was elected pope in 1455 . During the Siege of Belgrade ( 1456 ) , Callixtus initiated the custom that bells be rung at midday to remind the faithful to pray for the crusaders .

  "/wiki/Cardinal-nephew": "A cardinal-nephew ( Latin : cardinalis nepos ; Italian : cardinale nipote ; Spanish : valido de su t\u00edo ; French : prince de fortune ) was a cardinal elevated by a pope who was that cardinal 's relative . The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages , and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries . The last cardinal-nephew was named in 1689 and the practice was extinguished in 1692 . The word nepotism originally referred specifically to this practice , when it appeared in the English language about 1669 . From the middle of the Avignon Papacy ( 1309-1377 ) until Pope Innocent XII 's anti-nepotism bull ( a papal charter ) , Romanum decet pontificem ( 1692 ) , a pope without a cardinal-nephew was the exception to the rule . Every Renaissance pope who created cardinals appointed a relative to the College of Cardinals , and the nephew was the most common choice , although one of Alexander VI 's creations was his own son . The institution of the cardinal-nephew evolved over seven centuries , tracking developments in the history of the papacy and the styles of individual Popes . From 1566 until 1692 , a cardinal-nephew held the curial office of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State , known as the Cardinal Nephew , and thus the terms are sometimes used interchangeably . The curial office of the Cardinal Nephew as well as the institution of the cardinal-nephew declined as the power of the Cardinal Secretary of State increased and the temporal power of popes decreased in the 17th and 18th centuries . The list of cardinal-nephews includes at least fifteen , and possibly as many as nineteen popes ( Gregory IX , Alexander IV , Adrian V , Gregory XI , Boniface IX , Innocent VII , Eugene IV , Paul II , Alexander VI , Pius III , Julius II , Leo X , Clement VII , Benedict XIII , and Pius VII ; perhaps also John XIX and Benedict IX , if they were really promoted cardinals ; as well as Innocent III and Benedict XII , if in fact they were related to their elevators ) ; one antipope ( John XXIII ) ; and two or three saints ( Charles Borromeo , Guarinus of Palestrina , and perhaps Anselm of Lucca , if he was really a cardinal ) .",

They were from Aragon , the surname being a toponymic from the town of Borja , then in the Crown of Aragon , in Spain . The Borgias became prominent in ecclesiastical and political affairs in the 15th and 16th centuries , producing two popes : Alfons de Borja , who ruled as Pope Callixtus III during 1455-1458 , and Rodrigo Lanzol Borgia , as Pope Alexander VI , during 1492-1503 . Especially during the reign of Alexander VI , they were suspected of many crimes , including adultery , incest , simony , theft , bribery , and murder ( especially murder by arsenic poisoning ) . Because of their grasping for power , they made enemies of the Medici , the Sforza , and the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola , among others . They were also patrons of the arts who contributed to the Renaissance art . The Borgia family stands out in history as being infamously steeped in sin and immorality , yet there is evidence to suggest that this one-dimensional characterization is a result of undeserved contemporary critiques .",

In 2017 , around 967,069 people lived within the city 's administrative limits while its province-level municipality has a population of 3,115,320 residents . Its continuously built-up metropolitan area ( that stretches beyond the boundaries of the Metropolitan City of Naples ) is the second or third largest metropolitan area in Italy and one of the most densely populated cities in Europe . First settled by Greeks in the second millennium BC , Naples is one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban areas in the world . In the ninth century BC , a colony known as Parthenope or \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c0\u03b7 was established on the Island of Megaride , later refounded as Ne\u00e1polis in the sixth century BC . The city was an important part of Magna Graecia , played a major role in the merging of Greek and Roman society and a significant cultural centre under the Romans . It served as the capital of the Duchy of Naples ( 661-1139 ) , then of the Kingdom of Naples ( 1282-1816 ) and finally of the Two Sicilies until the unification of Italy in 1861 . Naples is also considered a capital of the Baroque since the arrival of Caravaggio in the 17th century , and due to the artistic revolution his arrival occasioned . Between 1925 and 1936 , Naples was expanded and upgraded by Benito Mussolini 's government but subsequently sustained severe damage from Allied bombing during World War II , which led to extensive post-1945 reconstruction work . Naples has experienced significant economic growth in recent decades , helped by the construction of the Centro Direzionale business district and an advanced transportation network , which includes the Alta Velocit\u00e0 high-speed rail link to Rome and Salerno and an expanded subway network .

Nicknamed the Warrior Pope or the Fearsome Pope , he chose his papal name not in honour of Pope Julius I but in emulation of Julius Caesar . One of the most powerful and influential popes , Julius II was a central figure of the High Renaissance and left a significant mark in world history . Julius II became Pope in the context of the Italian Wars , a period in which the major powers of Europe fought for primacy in the Italian peninsula . Louis XII of France controlled the Duchy of Milan , previously held by the Sforza , and French influence had replaced that of the Medici in the Republic of Florence . The Kingdom of Naples was under Spanish rule , and the Borja family from Spain was a major political faction in the Papal States following the reign of Alexander VI . The Archduke of Austria Maximilian I was hostile to France and Venice , and desired to descend in Italy in order to obtain the Papal coronation as Holy Roman Emperor . The conclave capitulation preceding his election included several terms , such as the opening of an ecumenical council and the organization of a crusade against the Ottoman Turks . Once crowned , Julius II proclaimed instead his goal to centralize the Papal States ( in large part a patchwork of communes and signorie ) and free Italy from the barbarians . In his early years as Pope , Julius II removed the Borjas from power and exiled them to Spain . Cesare Borgia , Duke of Romagna , shared the same fate and lost his possessions .

In the case of Venice , an additional privilege allows the patriarch , even if he is not a cardinal , the use of the colour red in non-liturgical vestments . In that case , the red biretta is topped by a tuft , as is the custom with other bishops who are not cardinals . The diocese of Venice was created in 774 as suffragan of the Patriarchate of Grado . It was only in 1451 that , in consideration of the political influence of the city , its bishops were accorded the title of patriarch by the pope . By a relatively recent tradition , the Patriarch of Venice is created a cardinal at the consistory following his appointment , although the pope is not bound by law to do so and is yet to do so for current Patriarch Francesco Moraglia , who remains an archbishop . In the last centuries of the Republic of Venice ( to 1797 ) , exceptionally among Catholic bishops , the patriarch was elected by the Venetian Senate , who always chose a member of one of the hereditary patrician families of the city , and usually a layman who was only ordained to take up the patriarchate . The papacy obliged them to pass an examination in theology , though many evaded this . Usually the new patriarch was a Venetian diplomat or administrator , as with Lorenzo Priuli in 1591 or Francesco Vendramin in 1608 , though some were career clerics , who had usually been previously in positions in Rome , like Federico Cornaro in 1631 .
