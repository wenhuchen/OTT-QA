  "/wiki/Green_Line_(MBTA)": "The Green Line is a light rail system run by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ( MBTA ) in the Boston , Massachusetts , metropolitan area . It is the oldest Boston rapid transit line , and with tunnel sections dating from 1897 , the oldest in America . It runs as a deep-level subway through downtown Boston , and on the surface into inner suburbs via four branches on several radial boulevards . With an average daily weekday ridership of 160,000 in 2019 , it is the second most heavily used light rail system in the country . The line was assigned the green color in 1967 during a systemwide rebranding because several branches pass through sections of the Emerald Necklace of Boston . The four branches are the remnants of a large streetcar system , which began in 1856 with the Cambridge Horse Railroad and was consolidated into the Boston Elevated Railway several decades later . The branches all travel downtown through the Tremont Street Subway , the oldest subway tunnel in North America . The Tremont Street Subway opened its first section on September 1 , 1897 , to take streetcars off overcrowded downtown streets ; it was extended five times over the next five decades . The streetcar system peaked in size around 1930 and was gradually replaced with trackless trolleys and buses , with cuts as late as 1985 . A new branch opened on a converted commuter rail line in 1959 ; the Green Line Extension project will extend two branches into Somerville and Medford in 2021 .",
  "/wiki/Green_Line_\"E\"_Branch": "The E Branch ( also referred to as the Huntington Avenue Branch , or formerly as the Arborway Branch ) is a streetcar line in the Boston , Massachusetts area , operating as a branch of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Green Line .

The segment of the line between Brigham Circle and Heath Street is the only remaining section of street-running tracks in revenue use by the MBTA ; all other trackage is in tunnels and bridges , on private rights-of-way , in reserved medians , or is used for out-of-service trains ( near Cleveland Circle ) . Northeast of the street-running section , the tracks run in the median of Huntington Avenue before descending via the Northeastern Incline into the Huntington Avenue Subway . Just west of Copley station , an underground flat junction connects the line into the other Green Line branches in the Boylston Street Subway , where they all run together to downtown .

With that , it also switched from Middlesex County , to which it had belonged since 1643 , to Suffolk County . It has had a substantial Irish-American population since the migration of Irish people during the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s . Since the late 1980s , the neighborhood has changed dramatically because of its proximity to downtown and its colonial architecture . A mix of yuppie and upper-middle-class gentrification has influenced much of the area , as it has in many of Boston 's neighborhoods , but Charlestown still maintains a strong Irish-American population and Townie identity . In the 21st century , Charlestown 's diversity has expanded dramatically , along with growing rates of the very poor and very wealthy .
