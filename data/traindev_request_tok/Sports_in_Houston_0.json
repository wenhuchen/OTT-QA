  "/wiki/Basketball": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop . A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three-point line , when it is worth three . After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws . The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated . Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running ( dribbling ) or by passing it to a teammate , both of which require considerable skill . On offense , players may use a variety of shots - the lay-up , the jump shot , or a dunk ; on defense , they may steal the ball from a dribbler , intercept passes , or block shots ; either offense or defense may collect a rebound , that is , a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard . It is a violation to lift or drag one 's pivot foot without dribbling the ball , to carry it , or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling . The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) . Informally , players may play three-on-three , two-on-two , and one-on-one . Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield , Massachusetts , United States , basketball has evolved to become one of the world 's most popular and widely viewed sports . The National Basketball Association ( NBA ) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity , salaries , talent , and level of competition .

Indoor soccer , as it is most often known in the United States and Canada , was originally developed in these two countries as a way to play soccer during the winter months , when snow would make outdoor play difficult . In those countries , gymnasiums are adapted for indoor soccer play . In other countries the game is played in either indoor or outdoor arenas surrounded by walls , and is referred to by different names ( such as fast football ( futbol rapido ) in Mexico , showbol in South America , and indoor football ( futbol indoor ) in Spain ) . Indoor soccer has different regulations from other versions of association football designed for indoor play , such as futsal and five-a-side football . Unlike futsal , which is played on wooden or ceramic surfaces , indoor soccer is played on synthetic turf ( or , in the case of the British Masters Football variety , synthetic carpet ) . Indoor soccer courts are either delimited by walls or lines , and there are no player throw-ins . FIFA , the international body that oversees international association football competitions , does not sanction the synthetic turf version of indoor soccer , having developed its own code of indoor football ( which they refer to as futsal ) . Indoor soccer is most popular in the United States , Canada , and Mexico , with several amateur , collegiate and professional leagues functioning . While internationally less popular than futsal , indoor soccer is also played at the league level in many countries outside North America .

Points are scored by kicking the oval-shaped ball between the middle goal posts ( worth six points ) or between a goal and behind post ( worth one point ) . During general play , players may position themselves anywhere on the field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball . The primary methods are kicking , handballing and running with the ball . There are rules on how the ball can be handled : for example , players running with the ball must intermittently bounce or touch it on the ground . Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught holding the ball . A distinctive feature of the game is the mark , where players anywhere on the field who catch the ball from a kick ( with specific conditions ) are awarded possession . Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a free kick or mark is paid . Players can tackle using their hands or use their whole body to obstruct opponents . Dangerous physical contact ( such as pushing an opponent in the back ) , interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks , distance penalties or suspension for a certain number of matches , depending on the seriousness of the infringement .

Ultimate was developed in 1968 by a group of students at Columbia High School in Maplewood , New Jersey . Although Ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements , it is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating , even at the highest levels of competition . The term frisbee , often used to generically describe all flying discs , is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company , and thus the sport is not formally called Ultimate frisbee , though this name is still in common casual use . Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone . Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc , and interceptions , incomplete passes , and passes out of bounds are turnovers . Rain , wind , or occasionally other adversities can make for a testing match with rapid turnovers , heightening the pressure of play . From its beginnings in the American counterculture of the late 1960s , ultimate has resisted empowering any referee with rule enforcement . Instead it relies on the sportsmanship of players and invokes Spirit of the Game to maintain fair play . Players call their own fouls , and dispute a foul only when they genuinely believe it did not occur . Playing without referees is the norm for league play but has been supplanted in club competition by the use of observers or game advisors to help in disputes , and the professional league employs empowered referees . In 2012 , there were 5.1 million Ultimate players in the United States .",

In addition , the league plays in the regular season and playoffs format rather than the use of promotion and relegation used commonly in other esports and non-North American leagues , with players on the roster being assured a minimum annual salary , benefits , and a portion of winnings and revenue-sharing based on how that team performs . The League was announced in 2016 with its inaugural season taking place in 2018 , with a total prize pool of US $ 3.5 million given to teams that year .",
  "/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)": "Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment . Described as a hero shooter , Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six , with each player selecting from a roster of over 30 characters , known as heroes , each with a unique style of play that is divided into three general roles that fit their purpose . Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time . Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay , such as character skins and victory poses , as they play the game . The game was initially launched with only casual play , but a competitive ranked mode , various 'arcade ' game modes , and a player-customizable server browser were added after release . Additionally , Blizzard has added new characters , maps , and game modes post-release , all free of charge , with the only additional cost to players being optional loot boxes to earn cosmetic items . It was released for PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , and Windows in May 2016 , and Nintendo Switch in October 2019 . Overwatch is Blizzard 's fourth major franchise and came about following the 2014 cancellation of the ambitious massively multiplayer online role-playing game Titan . A portion of the Titan team came up with the concept of Overwatch , based on the success of team-based first-person shooters like Team Fortress 2 and the popularity of multiplayer online battle arena games , creating a hero-based shooter that emphasized teamwork . Some elements of Overwatch borrow assets and concepts from the canceled Titan project . After establishing the narrative of an optimistic near-future Earth setting after a global crisis , the developers aimed to create a diverse cast of heroes that spanned genders and ethnicities as part of this setting . Significant time is spent adjusting the balance of the characters , making sure that new players would still be able to have fun while skilled players would present each other with a challenge .",

  "/wiki/American_football": "American football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , [ nb 1 ] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , the team with possession of the oval-shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it , while the defense , the team without possession of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays ; if they fail , they turn over the football to the defense , but if they succeed , they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive . Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins . American football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of soccer and rugby . The first American football match was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the Father of American Football , established the snap , the line of scrimmage , eleven-player teams , and the concept of downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game ( although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp 's ) . Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football . The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football .",
