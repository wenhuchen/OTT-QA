  "/wiki/Kent": "Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties . It borders Greater London to the north-west , Surrey to the west and East Sussex to the south-west . The county also shares borders with Essex along the estuary of the River Thames ( connected by land via High Speed 1 and the Dartford Crossing ) , and with the French department of Pas-de-Calais through the Channel Tunnel . The county town is Maidstone . Kent was among the first British territories conquered and settled by Anglo-Saxons . Canterbury Cathedral in Kent has been the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury , leader of the Church of England , since the Reformation . Prior to that it was built by Catholics , dating back to the conversion of England to Catholicism by Saint Augustine that began in the 6th century . Before the English Reformation the cathedral was part of a Benedictine monastic community known as Christ Church , Canterbury , as well as being the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury . The last Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury was Reginald Pole . Rochester Cathedral is also in Kent , in Medway . It is the second-oldest cathedral in England , with Canterbury Cathedral being the oldest . Between London and the Strait of Dover , which separates it from mainland Europe , Kent has seen both diplomacy and conflict , ranging from the Leeds Castle peace talks of 1978 and 2004 to the Battle of Britain in World War II .",
  "/wiki/British_Museum": "The British Museum , in the Bloomsbury area of London , United Kingdom , is a public institution dedicated to human history , art and culture . Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence , having been widely sourced during the era of the British Empire . It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present . [ a ] It was the first public national museum in the world . The British Museum was established in 1753 , largely based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane . It first opened to the public in 1759 , in Montagu House , on the site of the current building . Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions , the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881 . In 1973 , the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum , but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997 . The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital , Culture , Media and Sport , and as with all national museums in the UK it charges no admission fee , except for loan exhibitions . Its ownership of some of its most famous objects originating in other countries is disputed and remains the subject of international controversy , most notably in the case of the Parthenon Marbles .",
  "/wiki/Penny_(English_coin)": "The English penny ( plural pence ) , originally a coin of 1.3 to 1.5 grams ( 0.042 to 0.048 troy ounces ; 0.046 to 0.053 ounces ) pure silver , was introduced c. 785 by King Offa of Mercia .

Usually considered the last king of the House of Wessex , he ruled from 1042 to 1066 . Edward was the son of \u00c6thelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy . He succeeded Cnut the Great 's son - and his own half brother - Harthacnut . He restored the rule of the House of Wessex after the period of Danish rule since Cnut ( better known as Canute ) conquered England in 1016 . When Edward died in 1066 , he was succeeded by Harold Godwinson , who was defeated and killed in the same year by the Normans under William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings . Edgar the \u00c6theling , who was of the House of Wessex , was proclaimed king after the Battle of Hastings in 1066 , but never ruled and was deposed after about eight weeks . Historians disagree about Edward 's fairly long ( 24-year ) reign . His nickname reflects the traditional image of him as unworldly and pious . Confessor reflects his reputation as a saint who did not suffer martyrdom , as opposed to King Edward the Martyr . Some portray Edward the Confessor 's reign as leading to the disintegration of royal power in England and the advance in power of the House of Godwin , due to the infighting that began after his heirless death . Biographers Frank Barlow and Peter Rex , on the other hand , portray Edward as a successful king , one who was energetic , resourceful and sometimes ruthless ; they argue that the Norman conquest shortly after his death tarnished his image .",

  "/wiki/Cloisonn\u00e9": "Cloisonn\u00e9 ( French pronunciation : \u200b [ klwaz\u0254ne ] ) is an ancient technique for decorating metalwork objects . In recent centuries , vitreous enamel has been used , and inlays of cut gemstones , glass and other materials were also used during older periods . The resulting objects can also be called cloisonn\u00e9 . The decoration is formed by first adding compartments ( cloisons in French ) to the metal object by soldering or affixing silver or gold wires or thin strips placed on their edges . These remain visible in the finished piece , separating the different compartments of the enamel or inlays , which are often of several colors . Cloisonn\u00e9 enamel objects are worked on with enamel powder made into a paste , which then needs to be fired in a kiln . In antiquity , the cloisonn\u00e9 technique was mostly used for jewellery and small fittings for clothes , weapons or similar small objects decorated with geometric or schematic designs , with thick cloison walls . In the Byzantine Empire techniques using thinner wires were developed to allow more pictorial images to be produced , mostly used for religious images and jewellery , and by then always using enamel . By the 14th century this enamel technique had spread to China , where it was soon used for much larger vessels such as bowls and vases ; the technique remains common in China to the present day , and cloisonn\u00e9 enamel objects using Chinese-derived styles were produced in the West from the 18th century .",

  "/wiki/Viking": "Vikings [ a ] were Scandinavians , who from the late 8th to late 11th centuries , raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe , and explored westwards to Iceland , Greenland , and Vinland . The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to include the inhabitants of Norse home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age , 793-1066 AD . This period of Nordic military , mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia , Estonia , the British Isles , France , Kievan Rus ' and Sicily . Facilitated by advanced sailing and navigational skills , and characterised by the longship , Viking activities at times also extended into the Mediterranean littoral , North Africa , and the Middle East . Following extended phases of ( primarily sea- or river-borne ) exploration , expansion and settlement , Viking ( Norse ) communities and governments were established in diverse areas of north-western Europe , Belarus , Ukraine and European Russia , the North Atlantic islands and as far as the north-eastern coast of North America . This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture , while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into Scandinavia itself , with profound developmental implications in both directions . Popular , modern conceptions of the Vikings - the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia - often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from archaeology and historical sources . A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century ; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival . Perceived views of the Vikings as alternatively violent , piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century . Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clich\u00e9s and stereotypes , complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy . These representations are not always accurate - for example , there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets , a costuming element that first appeared in Wagnerian opera .",

Buckinghamshire is one of the home counties and towns such as High Wycombe , Amersham , Chesham and the Chalfonts in the east and southeast of the county are parts of the London commuter belt , forming some of the most densely populated parts of the county . Development in this region is restricted by the Metropolitan Green Belt . Other large settlements include the county town of Aylesbury , Marlow in the south near the Thames and Princes Risborough in the west near Oxford . Some areas without direct rail links to London , such as around the old county town of Buckingham and near Olney in the northeast , are much less populous . The largest town is Milton Keynes in the northeast , which with the surrounding area is administered as a unitary authority separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire . The remainder of the county is administered by Buckinghamshire County Council as a non-metropolitan county , and four district councils . In national elections , Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the Conservative Party . A large part of the Chiltern Hills , an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty , runs through the south of the county and attracts many walkers and cyclists from London . In this area older buildings are often made from local flint and red brick . Many parts of the county are quite affluent and like many areas around London this has led to high housing costs : several reports have identified the market town of Beaconsfield as having among the highest property prices outside London . Chequers , a mansion estate owned by the government , is the country retreat of the incumbent Prime Minister .",
  "/wiki/\u00c6thelred_the_Unready": "\u00c6thelred II ( Old English : \u00c6\u00feelr\u00e6d , pronounced [ \u00e6\u00f0elr\u00e6\u02d0d ] ; [ n 1 ] c. 966 - 23 April 1016 ) , known as the Unready , was King of the English from 978 to 1013 and again from 1014 until his death . His epithet does not derive from the modern word unready , but rather from the Old English unr\u00e6d meaning poorly advised ; it is a pun on his name , which means well advised . \u00c6thelred was the son of King Edgar and Queen \u00c6lfthryth . He came to the throne at about the age of 12 , following the assassination of his older half-brother , Edward the Martyr . His brother 's murder was carried out by supporters of his own claim to the throne , although he was too young to have any personal involvement . The chief problem of \u00c6thelred 's reign was conflict with the Danes . After several decades of relative peace , Danish raids on English territory began again in earnest in the 980s . Following the Battle of Maldon in 991 , \u00c6thelred paid tribute , or Danegeld , to the Danish king . In 1002 , \u00c6thelred ordered what became known as the St. Brice 's Day massacre of Danish settlers . In 1013 , King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark invaded England , as a result of which \u00c6thelred fled to Normandy in 1013 and was replaced by Sweyn . However , he returned as king for two years after Sweyn 's death in 1014 . \u00c6thelred 's 37-year combined reign was the longest of any Anglo-Saxon king of England , and was only surpassed in the 13th century , by Henry III .",

Yet after the deaths of his heirs within a decade of his own , and the Norman conquest of England in 1066 , this legacy was lost . He is popularly invoked in the context of the legend of King Canute and the tide , which often misrepresents him as a deluded monarch believing he has supernatural powers , contrary to the original legend which portrays a wise king who rebuked his courtiers for their fawning behaviour . As a Danish prince , Cnut won the throne of England in 1016 in the wake of centuries of Viking activity in northwestern Europe . Scotland submitted to him in 1017 . His later accession to the Danish throne in 1018 brought the crowns of England and Denmark together . Cnut sought to keep this power-base by uniting Danes and English under cultural bonds of wealth and custom , as well as through sheer brutality . After a decade of conflict with opponents in Scandinavia , Cnut claimed the crown of Norway in Trondheim in 1028 . The Swedish city Sigtuna was held by Cnut ( he had coins struck there that called him king , but there is no narrative record of his occupation ) . Dominion of England lent the Danes an important link to the maritime zone between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland , where Cnut , like his father before him , had a strong interest and wielded much influence among the Norse-Gaels . Cnut 's possession of England 's dioceses and the continental Diocese of Denmark - with a claim laid upon it by the Holy Roman Empire 's Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen - was a source of great prestige and leverage within the Catholic Church and among the magnates of Christendom ( gaining notable concessions such as one on the price of the pallium of his bishops , though they still had to travel to obtain the pallium , as well as on the tolls his people had to pay on the way to Rome ) . After his 1026 victory against Norway and Sweden , and on his way back from Rome where he attended the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor , Cnut , in a letter written for the benefit of his subjects , deemed himself King of all England and Denmark and the Norwegians and of some of the Swedes .",

  "/wiki/Celtic_art": "Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts ; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period , as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain , but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages . Celtic art is a difficult term to define , covering a huge expanse of time , geography and cultures . A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age , and indeed the preceding Neolithic age ; however archaeologists generally use Celtic to refer to the culture of the European Iron Age from around 1000 BC onwards , until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned , and art historians typically begin to talk about Celtic art only from the La T\u00e8ne period ( broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC ) onwards . Early Celtic art is another term used for this period , stretching in Britain to about 150 AD . The Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland , which produced the Book of Kells and other masterpieces , and is what Celtic art evokes for much of the general public in the English-speaking world , is called Insular art in art history . This is the best-known part , but not the whole of , the Celtic art of the Early Middle Ages , which also includes the Pictish art of Scotland . Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources , but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects , which are often extremely stylised when they do appear ; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence . Energetic circular forms , triskeles and spirals are characteristic . Much of the surviving material is in precious metal , which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture , but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses , large monumental sculpture , even with decorative carving , is very rare . Possibly the few standing male figures found , like the Warrior of Hirschlanden and the so-called Lord of Glauberg , were originally common in wood . Also covered by the term is the visual art of the Celtic Revival ( on the whole more notable for literature ) from the 18th century to the modern era , which began as a conscious effort by Modern Celts , mostly in the British Isles , to express self-identification and nationalism , and became popular well beyond the Celtic nations , and whose style is still current in various popular forms , from Celtic cross funerary monuments to interlace tattoos . Coinciding with the beginnings of a coherent archaeological understanding of the earlier periods , the style self-consciously used motifs closely copied from works of the earlier periods , more often the Insular than the Iron Age .",
  "/wiki/Penannular_brooch": "The Celtic brooch , more properly called the penannular brooch , and its closely related type , the pseudo-penannular brooch , are types of brooch clothes fasteners , often rather large ; penannular means formed as an incomplete ring . They are especially associated with the beginning of the Early Medieval period in the British Isles , although they are found in other times and places - for example , forming part of traditional female dress in areas in modern North Africa . Beginning as utilitarian fasteners in the Iron Age and Roman period , they are especially associated with the highly ornate brooches produced in precious metal for the elites of Ireland and Scotland from about 700 to 900 , which are popularly known as Celtic brooches or similar terms . They are the most significant objects in high-quality secular metalwork from Early Medieval Celtic art , or Insular art , as art historians prefer to call it . The type continued in simpler forms such as the thistle brooch into the 11th century , during what is often known as the Viking Age in Ireland and Scotland . Both penannular and pseudo-penannular brooches feature a long pin attached by its head to a ring ; the pin can move freely around the ring as far as the terminals , which are close together . In the true penannular type , the ring is not closed ; there is a gap between the terminals wide enough for the pin to pass through . In the pseudo-penannular type , the ring is closed , but there are still two separately defined terminals , which are joined by a further element . The penannular type is a simple and efficient way of fastening loosely woven cloth ( where the pin will not leave a permanent hole ) , but the pseudo-penannular type is notably less efficient . The brooches were worn by both men and women , usually singly at the shoulder by men and on the breast by women , and with the pin pointing up ; an Irish law code says that in the event of injury from a pin to another person , the wearer is not at fault if the pin did not project too far and the brooch was worn in these ways by the sexes . The most elaborate examples were clearly significant expressions of status at the top of society , which were also worn by clergy , at least in Ireland , though probably to fasten copes and other vestments rather than as everyday wear . The Senchas Mhor , an early Irish law tract , specified that the sons of major kings , when being fostered , should have brooches of gold having crystal inserted in them , while the sons of minor kings need wear only silver brooches .",

  "/wiki/Niello": "Niello is a black mixture , usually of sulphur , copper , silver , and lead , used as an inlay on engraved or etched metal , especially silver . It is added as a powder or paste , then fired until it melts or at least softens , and flows or is pushed into the engraved lines in the metal . It hardens and blackens when cool , and the niello on the flat surface is polished off to show the filled lines in black , contrasting with the polished metal ( usually silver ) around it . It may also be used with other metalworking techniques to cover larger areas , as seen in the sky in the diptych illustrated here . The metal where niello is to be placed is often roughened to provide a key . In many cases , especially in objects that have been buried underground , where the niello is now lost , the roughened surface indicates that it was once there . Niello was used on a variety of objects including sword hilts , chalices , plates , horns , adornment for horses , jewellery such as bracelets , rings , pendants , and small fittings such as strap-ends , purse-bars , buttons , belt buckles and the like . It was also used to fill in the letters in inscriptions engraved on metal . Periods when engraving filled in with niello has been used to make full images with figures have been relatively few , but include some significant achievements . In ornament , it came to have competition from enamel , with far wider colour possibilities , which eventually displaced it in most of Europe . The name derives from the Latin nigellum for the substance , or nigello or neelo , the medieval Latin for black . Though historically most common in Europe , it is also known from many parts of Asia and the Near East ."
