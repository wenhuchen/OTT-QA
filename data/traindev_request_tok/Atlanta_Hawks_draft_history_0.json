This draft was the last to use the original weighted lottery system that gave teams near the bottom of the NBA draft better odds at the top three picks of the draft while teams higher up had worse odds in the process ; the rule was agreed upon by the NBA on September 28 , 2017 , but would not be implemented until the 2019 draft . It was also considered the final year where undrafted college underclassmen were forced to begin their professional careers early ; on August 8 , 2018 , the NCAA announced that players who declared for the NBA draft and were not selected would have the opportunity to return to their school for at least another year . With the last year of what was , at the time , the most recent lottery system ( with the NBA draft lottery being held in Chicago instead of in New York ) , the Phoenix Suns won the first overall pick on May 15 , 2018 , with the Sacramento Kings at the second overall pick and the Atlanta Hawks at third overall pick . The Suns ' selection was their first No . 1 overall selection in franchise history . They used the selection on the Bahamian center Deandre Ayton from the nearby University of Arizona .

It forms part of the Macaronesia ecoregion , along with the Azores , Canary Islands , Madeira , and the Savage Isles . Located 570 kilometres ( 350 mi ) west of the Cape Verde Peninsula off the coast of Northwest Africa , the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000 square kilometres ( 1,500 sq mi ) . The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century , when Portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the islands , establishing the first European settlement in the tropics . Ideally located for the Atlantic slave trade , the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries , attracting merchants , privateers , and pirates . The end of transatlantic slavery in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration . Cape Verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes . Incorporated as an overseas department of Portugal in 1951 , the islands continued to campaign for independence , which was achieved in 1975 . Since the early 1990s , Cape Verde has been a stable representative democracy , and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa . Lacking natural resources , its developing economy is mostly service-oriented , with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment . Its population of around 540,000 is mostly of mixed European , Moorish , Arab and African heritage , and predominantly Roman Catholic , reflecting the legacy of Portuguese rule .
