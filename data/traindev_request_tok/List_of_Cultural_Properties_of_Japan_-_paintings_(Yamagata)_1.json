  "/wiki/Nori": "Nori ( \u6d77\u82d4 ) is the Japanese name for edible seaweed ( a sea vegetable ) species of the red algae genus Pyropia , including P. yezoensis and P. tenera . It has a strong and distinctive flavor . It is used chiefly in Japanese cuisine as an ingredient to wrap rolls of sushi or onigiri , in which case the term refers to the dried sheets . The finished dried sheets are made by a shredding and rack-drying process that resembles papermaking . They are sold in packs in grocery stores for culinary purposes . Since nori sheets easily absorb water from the air and degrade , a desiccant is needed when storing nori for any significant time .",

Hiroshige is best known for his horizontal-format landscape series The Fifty-three Stations of the T\u014dkaid\u014d and for his vertical-format landscape series One Hundred Famous Views of Edo . The subjects of his work were atypical of the ukiyo-e genre , whose typical focus was on beautiful women , popular actors , and other scenes of the urban pleasure districts of Japan 's Edo period ( 1603-1868 ) . The popular series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji by Hokusai was a strong influence on Hiroshige 's choice of subject , though Hiroshige 's approach was more poetic and ambient than Hokusai 's bolder , more formal prints . Subtle use of color was essential in Hiroshige 's prints , often printed with multiple impressions in the same area and with extensive use of bokashi ( color gradation ) , both of which were rather labor-intensive techniques . For scholars and collectors , Hiroshige 's death marked the beginning of a rapid decline in the ukiyo-e genre , especially in the face of the westernization that followed the Meiji Restoration of 1868 . Hiroshige 's work came to have a marked influence on Western painting towards the close of the 19th century as a part of the trend in Japonism . Western artists , such as Manet and Monet , collected and closely studied Hiroshige 's compositions . Vincent van Gogh even went so far as to paint copies of two of Hiroshige 's prints from One Hundred Famous Views of Edo .",

  "/wiki/Bodhidharma": "Bodhidharma was a Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th or 6th century . He is traditionally credited as the transmitter of Chan Buddhism to China , and regarded as its first Chinese patriarch . According to Chinese legend , he also began the physical training of the monks of Shaolin Monastery that led to the creation of Shaolin kungfu . In Japan , he is known as Daruma . Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant , and subsequent accounts became layered with legend and unreliable details . [ note 1 ] According to the principal Chinese sources , Bodhidharma came from the Western Regions , which refers to Central Asia but may also include the Indian subcontinent , and was either a Persian Central Asian or a South Indian [ . ] the third son of a great Indian king . [ note 2 ] Throughout Buddhist art , Bodhidharma is depicted as an ill-tempered , profusely-bearded , wide-eyed non-Chinese person . He is referred as The Blue-Eyed Barbarian ( Chinese : \u78a7\u773c\u80e1 ; pinyin : B\u00ecy\u01cenh\u00fa ) in Chan texts .

Zen master Fuke ) - allegedly ca . 770-840 or 860 ) , also called P ' u-k ' o , and best known by his Japanese name , Fuke , was a potentially mythical Chinese Ch\u00e1n ( Zen ) master , monk-priest , wanderer and eccentric , whose existence and many affairs were advanced by the now defunct Fuke Zen or Hotto-ha sect , or sub-sect , of Japanese Rinzai Zen Buddhism in the 17th or 18th century with the publication of the later-disconfirmed document , the Kyotaku Denki ( \u865a\u9438\u4f1d\u8a18 ) , probably first published around 1640 . For the komus\u014d ( \u865a\u7121\u50e7 ) monks of the Fuke sect , he was considered the traditional antecedent - at least in spiritual or philosophical terms - of their order , which was formally established in Edo Japan . It is more likely that the ideological roots of the sect derived from the Rinzai poet and iconoclast Ikky\u016b and the monk Shinchi Kakushin ( \u5fc3\u5730\u89ba\u5fc3 ) who traveled to and from China and Japan in the 13th century . Still according to some accounts the sect is simply a more direct derivative of the Rinzai school and its teachings . The few records of Puhua 's life and affairs are those accounted , if only briefly , in several East Asian religious or historical references . One of the only credible sources on his life is to be found in the Tang Dynasty Record of Linji , wherein he is portrayed as an obscure student and eventual dharma heir of Panshan Baoji , as well as a friend , colleague , student and/or contemporary of Linji Yixuan , who founded the Linji ( \u81e8\u6e08\u5b97 Rinzai ) sect in China . This implies that he may have been a real individual , although the legends surrounding him in the Kyotaku Denki which connect him to the Fuke sect have been proven as fabrications created to further the komus\u014ds ' benefits under the Tokugawa shogunate . The legends surrounding Puhua were more recently mentioned in the Monumenta Nipponica , R.H. Blyth 's A History of Haiku ( published in 1963 ) as well as some of the writings of Osho , along with later publications concerning the Fuke-sh\u016b , the shakuhachi and related topics . In 1988 a shakuhachi learning and playing manual co-authored by the shakuhachi performer Christopher Yohmei Blasdel and the scholar Kamisango Y\u016bk\u014d was published ; the work is entitled The Shakuhachi : A Manual for Learning no-repeat ; background-position : right .1em center } .",
