The console is the successor to the PlayStation Portable , and a part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices ; as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles , it primarily competed with the Nintendo 3DS . The original model of the handheld includes a 5-inch ( 130 mm ) OLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen , two analog joysticks , and front and shoulder push-button input , and supports Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , and optional 3G . Internally , the Vita features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a quad-core SGX543MP graphics processing unit . The PS Vita 2000 series , a revised version of the system , was released across 2013 and 2014 , sports all of the same features with a slightly smaller size , extended battery life , and an LCD screen replacing the OLED display . Sony also released the PlayStation TV , a short-lived , re-purposed version of the Vita that allowed for the play of PS Vita games on a television screen similar to a home video game console , though the PS TV variant was discontinued by the end of 2015 . The system 's design was created to meld the experience of big budget , dedicated video game platforms with the then up-and-coming trend of mobile gaming through smart phones and tablets . However , in the year after the device 's successful launch , sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled , threatening to end its lifespan . A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West , combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies , helped keep the platform afloat . While this led to less diversity in its game library , it did garner strong support in JRPGs and visual novels , alongside a wealth of Western-developed indie games , leading it to become a moderate seller in Japan , and build a smaller , yet passionate userbase in the West . While Sony has not released exact sales figures , late-lifespan estimates in sales fall around 15 to 16 million units .",

  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
