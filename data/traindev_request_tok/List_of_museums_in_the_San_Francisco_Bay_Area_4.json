  "/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area": "The San Francisco Bay Area , popularly referred to as the Bay Area or simply the Bay , is a populous region surrounding the San Francisco , San Pablo , and Suisun Bay estuaries in Northern California . Although the exact boundaries of the region vary depending on the source , the Bay Area is defined by the Association of Bay Area Governments to include the nine counties that border the aforementioned estuaries : Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , Napa , San Mateo , Santa Clara , Solano , Sonoma , and San Francisco . Other sources may exclude parts of or even entire counties , or expand the definition to include neighboring counties that do not border the bay such as San Benito , San Joaquin , and Santa Cruz . Home to approximately 7.75 million people , Northern California 's nine-county Bay Area contains many cities , towns , airports , and associated regional , state , and national parks , connected by a complex multimodal transportation network . The larger combined statistical area of the region , which includes fourteen counties , is the second-largest in California ( after the Greater Los Angeles area ) , the fifth-largest in the United States , and the 41st-largest urban area in the world with 9.67 million people . The Bay Area 's population is ethnically diverse : for example , roughly half of the region 's residents are Hispanic , Asian , African American , or Pacific Islander , all of whom have a significant presence throughout the region . The earliest archaeological evidence of human settlements in the Bay Area dates back to 8000-10,000 BC ( from shell mounds in the Coyote Hills ) . In 1769 , the Bay Area was inhabited by the Ohlone people when a Spanish exploration party led by Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 entered the Bay - the first documented European visit to the Bay Area . After Mexico established independence from Spain in 1821 , the region was briefly controlled by the Mexican government until the United States purchased the territory in 1846 during the Mexican-American War . Soon after , discovery of gold in California attracted a flood of treasure seekers , many using ports in the Bay Area as an entry point . During the early years of California 's statehood , state legislative business rotated between three locations in the Bay Area before a permanent state capital was established in Sacramento . A major earthquake leveled the city of San Francisco and environs in 1906 , but the region quickly rebuilt in time to host the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition .",

  "/wiki/Spanish_missions_in_California": "The Spanish missions in California comprise a series of 21 religious outposts or missions established between 1769 and 1833 in what is now the U.S. state of California . Founded by Catholic priests of the Franciscan order to evangelize the Native Americans , the missions led to the creation of the New Spain province of Alta California and were part of the expansion of the Spanish Empire into the most northern and western parts of Spanish North America . Following long-term secular and religious policy of Spain in Spanish America , the missionaries forced the native Californians to live in settlements called reductions , disrupting their traditional way of life . The missionaries introduced European fruits , vegetables , cattle , horses , ranching , and technology . The missions have been accused by critics , then and now , of various abuses and oppression . In the end , the missions had mixed results in their objectives : to convert , educate , and transform the native peoples into Spanish colonial citizens . By 1810 , Spain 's king had been imprisoned by the French , and financing for military payroll and missions in California ceased . In 1821 , Mexico achieved independence from Spain , although Mexico did not send a governor to California until 1824 , and only a portion of payroll was ever reinstated ( ibid. ) . The 21,000 Mission Indians produced hide , tallow , wool , and textiles at this time , and the leather products were exported to Boston , South America , and Asia . This trading system sustained the colonial economy from 1810 until 1830 . The missions began to lose control over land in the 1820s , as unpaid military men unofficially encroached , but officially missions maintained authority over native neophytes and control of land holdings until the 1830s . At the peak of its development in 1832 , the coastal mission system controlled an area equal to approximately one-sixth of Alta California .",

  "/wiki/Fan_(implement)": "A handheld fan , or simply hand fan , may be any broad , flat surface that is waved back-and-forth to create an airflow . Generally , purpose-made handheld fans are folding fans , which are shaped like a sector of a circle and made of a thin material ( such as paper or feathers ) mounted on slats which revolve around a pivot so that it can be closed when not in use . On human skin , the airflow from handfans increases evaporation which has a cooling effect due to the latent heat of evaporation of water . It also increases heat convection by displacing the warmer air produced by body heat that surrounds the skin , which has an additional cooling effect , provided that the ambient air temperature is lower than the skin temperature - which is typically about 33 \u00b0C ( 91 \u00b0F ) . Fans are convenient to carry around , especially folding fans . Next to the folding fan , the rigid hand screen fan was also a highly decorative and desired object among the higher classes . Its purpose is different since they are more cumbersome to carry around . They were mostly used to shield the lady 's face against the glare of the sun or the fire ."
