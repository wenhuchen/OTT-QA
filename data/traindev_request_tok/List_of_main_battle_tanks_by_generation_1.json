As a further development of the T-55 series , the T-62 retained many similar design elements of its predecessor including low profile and thick turret armor . In contrast with previous tanks , which were armed with rifled tank guns , the T-62 was the first tank armed with a smoothbore tank gun that could fire APFSDS rounds at higher velocities . While the T-62 became the standard tank in the Soviet arsenal , it did not fully replace the T-55 in export markets due to its higher manufacturing costs and maintenance requirements compared to its predecessor . Although the T-62 was replaced in Russia and the successor states of the Soviet Union , it is still used in some countries and its design features became standardized in subsequent Soviet and Russian mass-produced tanks .",
  "/wiki/Soviet_Union": "The Soviet Union , [ b ] officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR or \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 ) , [ c ] was a federal sovereign state in northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991 . Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , [ d ] in practice its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic , the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( Russian SFSR ) . Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers ( 6,200 mi ) east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers ( 4,500 mi ) north to south . Its territory included much of Eastern Europe , as well as part of Northern Europe and all of Northern and Central Asia . It had five climate zones : tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced the autocratic regime of Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922 , after a civil war ending in the Bolsheviks ' victory , the USSR was formed by a treaty which united the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics . Following Lenin 's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle , Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s . Stalin formalized the Communist Party 's ideology of Marxism-Leninism and replaced the market economy with a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During this period , rapid economic development resulted in dramatic improvements in the average standard of living , particularly in urban areas .",
  "/wiki/T-55": "The T-54 and T-55 tanks are a series of Soviet main battle tanks introduced in the years following the Second World War . The first T-54 prototype was completed at Nizhny Tagil by the end of 1945 . Initial production ramp up settled for 1947 at Nizhny Tagil , and 1948 for Kharkiv were halted and curtailed as many problems were uncovered ; the T-34-85 still accounted for 88 percent of production through the 1950s . The T-54 eventually became the main tank for armoured units of the Soviet Army , armies of the Warsaw Pact countries , and many others . T-54s and T-55s have been involved in many of the world 's armed conflicts since the later part of the 20th century . The T-54/55 series eventually became the most-produced tank in military history . Estimated production numbers for the series range from 86,000 to 100,000 . They were replaced by the T-62 , T-64 , T-72 , T-80 and T-90 tanks in the Soviet and Russian armies , but remain in use by up to 50 other armies worldwide , some having received sophisticated retrofitting . During the Cold War , Soviet tanks never directly faced their NATO adversaries in combat in Europe . However , the T-54/55 's first appearance in the West around the period of the 1950s ( then the beginning of the Cold War ) spurred the United Kingdom to develop a new tank gun , the Royal Ordnance L7 , and the United States to develop the M60 Patton .",

Although developed from the M48 Patton , the M60 series was never officially classified as a member of the Patton tank family , but as a product-improved descendant of the Patton tank 's design . The United States fully committed to the Main Battle Tank doctrine in 1963 when the Marine Corps retired the last ( M103 ) heavy tank battalion . The M60 tank series became America 's primary main battle tank during the Cold War . Over 15,000 M60s were built by Chrysler . Hull production ended in 1983 , but 5,400 older models were converted to the M60A3 variant ending in 1990 . It reached operational capability with fielding to US Army units in Europe beginning in December 1960 . The first combat usage of the M60 was with Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War where it saw service under the Magach 6 designation , performing well in combat against comparable tanks such as the T-62 . In 1982 the Israelis once again used the M60 during the 1982 Lebanon War , equipped with upgrades such as explosive reactive armor to defend against guided missiles that proved very effective at destroying tanks . The M60 also saw use in 1983 with Operation Urgent Fury , supporting US Marines in an amphibious assault into Grenada . M60s delivered to Iran also served in the Iran-Iraq War .",

Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/M48_Patton": "The M48 Patton is an American first generation main battle tank ( MBT ) introduced in February 1951 . It was designed as a replacement for the M26 Pershing , M4 Sherman variants and M46 Pattons used in the Korean War , and as the successor to the M47 Patton . Nearly 12,000 M48s were built , mainly by Chrysler and AlCo , from 1952 to 1961 . The M48 underwent many design modifications and improvements during its production life . This led to a wide variety of suspension systems , cupola styles , power packs , fenders and other details among individual tanks . The early designs , up to the M48A2C , were powered by a gasoline engine . The M48A3 and A5 versions used a diesel engine , however gasoline engine versions were still in use in the US Army National Guard through 1968 and through 1975 by many West German Army units . Numerous examples of the M48 saw combat use in various Arab-Israeli conflicts and the Vietnam War . Beginning in 1959 , most American M48A1s and A2s were upgraded to the M48A3 model . The M48 Patton-series saw widespread service with the United States and NATO until it was superseded by the M60 tank as well as being widely exported . The tank 's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical , utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles and bridge layers . Some M48A5 models served into the mid-1980s with US Army National Guard units , and were used as targets for weapons and radar testing into the mid-1990s .",
  "/wiki/Leopard_1": "The Leopard ( or Leopard 1 ) is a main battle tank designed and produced by Porsche in West Germany that first entered service in 1965 . Developed in an era when HEAT warheads were thought to make conventional heavy armour of limited value , the Leopard focused on firepower in the form of the German-built version of the British L7 105-mm gun , and improved cross-country performance that was unmatched by other designs of the era . The design started as a collaborative project during the 1950s between West Germany and France , and later joined by Italy , but the partnership ended shortly after and the final design was ordered by the Bundeswehr , with full-scale production starting in 1965 . In total , 6,485 Leopard tanks have been built , of which 4,744 were battle tanks and 1,741 were utility and anti-aircraft variants , not including 80 prototypes and pre-series vehicles . The Leopard quickly became a standard of European forces , and eventually served as the main battle tank in over a dozen countries worldwide , with West Germany , Italy and the Netherlands being the largest operators until their retirement . Since 1990 , the Leopard 1 has gradually been relegated to secondary roles in most armies . In the German Army , the Leopard 1 was completely phased out in 2003 by the Leopard 2 , while Leopard 1-based vehicles are still widely used in utility roles . The Leopard 2 has replaced the Leopard 1 in service with many other nations as well , with derived vehicles using the Leopard 1 hull still seeing service . Currently , the largest operators are Greece , with 520 vehicles , Turkey , with 397 vehicles and Brazil with 378 vehicles . Most of these vehicles have been upgraded with various improvements to armour , firepower and sensors to maintain their ability to engage modern threats .",

During this Cold War period , the western portion of Germany was part of the Western Bloc . The Federal Republic was created during the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II , established from eleven states formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . Its ( provisional ) capital was the city of Bonn . The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the Bonn Republic . At the onset of the Cold War , Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs . Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories , the Saarland and a divided Berlin . Initially , the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany , considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich . It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair . From the West German perspective , the GDR was therefore illegitimate . Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 1952 , and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 .",

It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau , the Alps , and the Jura , spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 ( 15,940 sq mi ) , and land area of 39,997 km2 ( 15,443 sq mi ) . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory , the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau , where the largest cities are located , among them the two global cities and economic centres of Z\u00fcrich and Geneva . The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period , resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy . Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day . Since the Reformation of the 16th century , Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality ; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002 . Nevertheless , it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world . Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross , one of the world 's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations , and is home to numerous international organisations , including the second largest UN office .

The MBT-70 was developed by the United States and West Germany in the context of the Cold War , intended to counter the new generation of Warsaw Pact tanks developed by the Soviet Union . The new tank was to be equipped with a number of advanced features such as newly developed kneeling hydropneumatic suspension and housing the entire crew in the large turret , and was armed with a 152mm XM150 gun/launcher , which could use both conventional ammunition and the Shillelagh missile for long range combat . By the late 1960s , the development of the MBT-70 was well over budget and affected by design issues . West Germany withdrew from the project due to costs and new difference in requirements . The United States continued development of the MBT-70 until 1971 when the program was finally cancelled , with funds and technology from the MBT-70 project redirected to the development of the M1 Abrams . West Germany independently developed the Leopard 2 as its new main battle tank .",
  "/wiki/T-64": "The T-64 is a Soviet second-generation main battle tank introduced in the early 1960s . It was a more advanced counterpart to the T-62 : the T-64 served tank divisions , while the T-62 supported infantry in motorized rifle divisions . It introduced a number of advanced features including composite armor , a compact engine and transmission , and a smoothbore 125-mm gun equipped with an autoloader to allow the crew to be reduced to three so the tank could be smaller and lighter . In spite of being armed and armored like a heavy tank , the T-64 weighed only 38 tonnes ( 42 short tons ; 37 long tons ) . These features made the T-64 expensive to build , significantly higher than previous generations of Soviet tanks . This was especially true of the power pack , which was time-consuming to build and cost twice as much as more conventional designs . Several proposals were made to improve the T-64 with new engines , but chief designer Alexander Morozov 's political power in Moscow kept the design in production in spite of any concerns about price . This led to the T-72 being designed as an emergency design , only to be produced in the case of a war , but its 40% lower price led to it entering production in spite of Morozov 's objections . At present the T-64 is in use in very few nations or regions , but is currently undergoing significant factory overhauls and modernization in Ukraine . The newest , vastly upgraded and improved model of this 50-year-old design , the T-64BM Bulat , has increased in weight to 45 tonnes and is seeing active service in the field .",
  "/wiki/AMX_30": "The AMX-30 is a main battle tank designed by Ateliers de construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux ( AMX , then GIAT ) and first delivered to the French Army in 1966 . The first five tanks were issued to the 501st R\u00e9giment de Chars de Combat ( Tank Regiment ) in August of that year . The production version of the AMX-30 weighed 36 metric tons ( 40 short tons ) , and sacrificed protection for increased mobility . The French believed that it would have required too much armour to protect against the latest anti-tank threats , thereby reducing the tank 's maneuverability . Protection , instead , was provided by the speed and the compact dimensions of the vehicle , including a height of 2.28 metres . It had a 105 mm gun , firing a then advanced high explosive anti-tank warhead known as the Obus G. The Obus G used an outer shell , separated from the main charge by ball bearings , to allow the round to be spin stabilized by the gun without affecting the warhead inside . Mobility was provided by the 720 horsepower ( 540 kW ) HS-110 diesel engine , although the troublesome transmission adversely affected the tank 's performance . In 1979 , due to issues caused by the transmission , the French Army began to modernize its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards , which included a new transmission , an improved engine and the introduction of a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator . Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants , including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle , the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system , a bridge-layer , the Pluton tactical nuclear missile launcher and a surface-to-air missile launcher . It was preceded by two post-war French medium tank designs . The first , the ARL 44 , was an interim tank .

Six prototypes arrived in Belgium less than a month after the war in Europe ended in May 1945 . It first entered combat with the British Army in the Korean War in 1950 , in support of the UN forces . The Centurion later served in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 , where it fought against US-supplied M47 and M48 Patton tanks and it served with the Royal Australian Armoured Corps in Vietnam . Israel used Centurions in the 1967 Six-Day War , 1973 Yom Kippur War , and during the 1978 and 1982 invasions of Lebanon . Centurions modified as armoured personnel carriers were used in Gaza , the West Bank and on the Lebanese border . The Royal Jordanian Land Force used Centurions , first in 1970 to fend off a Syrian incursion within its borders during the Black September events and later in the Golan Heights in 1973 . South Africa deployed its Centurions in Angola during the South African Border War . It became one of the most widely used tank designs , equipping armies around the world , with some still in service until the 1990s .",

  "/wiki/Empire_of_Japan": "The Empire of Japan ( \u5927\u65e5\u672c\u5e1d\u570b , Dai Nippon Teikoku , literally Empire of Great Japan ) was the historical nation-state [ nb 2 ] and great power that existed from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 to the enactment of the 1947 constitution of modern Japan . Japan 's rapid industrialization and militarization under the slogan Fukoku Ky\u014dhei ( \u5bcc\u570b\u5f37\u5175 , Enrich the Country , Strengthen her Armed Forces ) and Shokusan K\u014dgy\u014d ( \u6b96\u7523\u8208\u696d , Promote Industry ) led to its emergence as a world power and the establishment of a colonial empire following the First Sino-Japanese War , the Boxer Rebellion , the Russo-Japanese War , and World War I . Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism and totalitarianism , eventually culminating in Japan 's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific in World War II . Japan 's armed forces initially achieved large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) and the Pacific War . However , after many Allied victories and following the Soviet Union 's declaration of war against Japan on August 9 , 1945 , and subsequent invasion of Manchuria and other territories , and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Empire surrendered to the Allies on August 15 , 1945 . A period of occupation by the Allies followed . In 1947 , with American involvement , a new constitution was enacted , officially bringing the Empire of Japan to an end . Occupation and reconstruction continued until 1952 , eventually forming the current constitutional monarchy known as Japan . The Emperors during this time , which spanned the entire Meiji , Taish\u014d , and the lesser part of the Sh\u014dwa era , are now known in Japan by their posthumous names , which coincide with those era names : Emperor Meiji ( Mutsuhito ) , Emperor Taish\u014d ( Yoshihito ) , and Emperor Sh\u014dwa ( Hirohito ) .",

The tank began development in 1970 , and entered official service in 1979 . Four main variants of the tank have been deployed . It was first used extensively in the 1982 Lebanon War . The name Merkava was derived from the IDF 's initial development program name . Design criteria include rapid repair of battle damage , survivability , cost-effectiveness and off-road performance . Following the model of contemporary self-propelled howitzers , the turret assembly is located closer to the rear than in most main battle tanks . With the engine in front , this layout is intended to grant additional protection against a frontal attack , so as to absorb some of the force of incoming shells , especially for the personnel in the main hull , such as the driver . It also creates more space in the rear of the tank that allows increased storage capacity and a rear entrance to the main crew compartment allowing easy access under enemy fire . This allows the tank to be used as a platform for medical disembarkation , a forward command and control station , and an infantry fighting vehicle . The rear entrance 's clamshell-style doors provide overhead protection when off- and on-loading cargo and personnel .",

Nevertheless , North Korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands . In 1910 , Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan . At the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 , Korea was divided into two zones , with the north occupied by the Soviet Union and the south occupied by the United States . Negotiations on reunification failed , and in 1948 , separate governments were formed : the socialist Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in the north , and the capitalist Republic of Korea in the south . An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) . The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire , but no peace treaty was signed .

  "/wiki/Composite_armour": "Composite armour is a type of vehicle armour consisting of layers of different material such as metals , plastics , ceramics or air . Most composite armours are lighter than their all-metal equivalent , but instead occupy a larger volume for the same resistance to penetration . It is possible to design composite armour stronger , lighter and less voluminous than traditional armour , but the cost is often prohibitively high , restricting its use to especially vulnerable parts of a vehicle . Its primary purpose is to help defeat high explosive anti-tank ( HEAT ) projectiles . HEAT had posed a serious threat to armoured vehicles since its introduction in World War II . Lightweight and small , HEAT projectiles could nevertheless penetrate hundreds of millimetres of the hardest steel armours . The capability of most materials for defeating HEAT follows the density law , which states that the penetration of shaped charge jets is proportional to the square root of the shaped charge liner density ( typically copper ) divided by the square root of the target density . On a weight basis , lighter targets are more advantageous than heavier targets , but using large quantities of lightweight materials has obvious disadvantages in terms of mechanical layout . Certain materials have an optimal compromise in terms of density that makes them particularly useful in this role .",
  "/wiki/Drozd": "Drozd ( thrush in Russian ) is an active protection system developed in the Soviet Union , designed for increasing tanks ' protection against anti-tank missiles and RPGs . It is considered the world 's first operational active protection system , created in 1977-78 by A. Shipunov 's KBP design bureau as Kompleks 1030M-01 . Its chief designer , Vasily Bakalov , was awarded the Lenin Prize for his work on its development . Drozd uses 24.5 GHz Doppler radar to detect incoming rounds travelling between 70 and 700 m/s ( to avoid engaging small arms or other faster projectiles ) . Its computer determines when to fire a 107 mm projectile . When the incoming round is at 7 m range , the Drozd fragmentation warhead detonates , spreading 3-gram slugs to destroy the incoming round . The Drozd system was relatively complex , requiring a radar array and two launch tubes on each side of the tank turret , and a large electronics package on the turret rear . One of Drozd 's shortcomings was that it was only able to protect a 60-degree arc around the forward part of the turret . Each unit costs around $ 30,000 , was 80 percent successful against incoming RPGs in Afghanistan , but proved to provide too high of a collateral damage issue to surrounding troops that were dismounted from their armored vehicles . The project was abandoned by the Army , but completed by the Soviet Naval Infantry to increase protection for about 250 older T-55 tanks in 1981-82 ( newer T-72s were problematic on landing craft , due to size and weight , and $ 170 million Drozd development was much cheaper than a commencement of an all-new time-consuming tank design ) . Tanks were upgraded to T-55M standard and equipped with Drozd at the tank rebuilding plant in Lviv , Ukraine , and kept in war stores for secrecy . The rebuilt tanks were designated T-55AD , or T-55AD1 if they had the newer V-46 engine .",
  "/wiki/Reactive_armour": "Reactive armour is a type of vehicle armour that reacts in some way to the impact of a weapon to reduce the damage done to the vehicle being protected . It is most effective in protecting against shaped charges and specially hardened kinetic energy penetrators . The most common type is explosive reactive armour ( ERA ) , but variants include self-limiting explosive reactive armour ( SLERA ) , non-energetic reactive armour ( NERA ) , non-explosive reactive armour ( NxRA ) , and electric reactive armour . NERA and NxRA modules can withstand multiple hits , unlike ERA and SLERA , but a second hit in exactly the same location may potentially penetrate any of those . Essentially all anti-tank munitions work by piercing the armour and killing the crew inside , disabling vital mechanical systems , or both . Reactive armour can be defeated with multiple hits in the same place , as by tandem-charge weapons , which fire two or more shaped charges in rapid succession . Without tandem charges , hitting the same spot twice is much more difficult .",
