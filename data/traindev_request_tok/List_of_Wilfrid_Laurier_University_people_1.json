  "/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Ontario": "The Legislative Assembly of Ontario ( French : Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative de l'Ontario ) is the deliberative assembly of the Legislature of Ontario ( also known as the Parliament of Ontario ) . The Assembly meets at the Ontario Legislative Building at Queen 's Park in the provincial capital of Toronto . Bills passed by the assembly are given royal assent by the Queen of Canada , represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario . As at the federal level in Canada , Ontario uses a Westminster-style parliamentary government , in which members are elected to the Legislative Assembly through general elections , from which the Premier of Ontario and Executive Council of Ontario are appointed based on majority support . The premier is Ontario 's head of government , while the Lieutenant Governor , as representative of the Queen , acts as head of state . The largest party not forming the government is known as the Official Opposition , its leader being recognized as Leader of the Opposition by the Speaker . The Ontario Legislature is sometimes referred to as the Ontario Provincial Parliament . Members of the assembly refer to themselves as Members of the Provincial Parliament ( MPPs ) as opposed to Members of the Legislative Assembly ( MLAs ) as in many other provinces . Ontario is the only province to do so , in accordance with a resolution passed in the Assembly on April 7 , 1938 . However , the Legislative Assembly Act refers only to members of the Assembly . The Legislative Assembly is the second largest Canadian provincial deliberative assembly by number of members after the National Assembly of Quebec . The current assembly was elected on June 7 , 2018 , as part of the 42nd Parliament of Ontario .",

  "/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method": "Monte Carlo methods , or Monte Carlo experiments , are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results . The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle . They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches . Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes : optimization , numerical integration , and generating draws from a probability distribution . In physics-related problems , Monte Carlo methods are useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom , such as fluids , disordered materials , strongly coupled solids , and cellular structures ( see cellular Potts model , interacting particle systems , McKean-Vlasov processes , kinetic models of gases ) . Other examples include modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs such as the calculation of risk in business and , in mathematics , evaluation of multidimensional definite integrals with complicated boundary conditions . In application to systems engineering problems ( space , oil exploration , aircraft design , etc . ) , Monte Carlo-based predictions of failure , cost overruns and schedule overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative soft methods . In principle , Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation . By the law of large numbers , integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical mean ( a.k.a . the sample mean ) of independent samples of the variable . When the probability distribution of the variable is parametrized , mathematicians often use a Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) sampler .",
  "/wiki/Option_(finance)": "In finance , an option is a contract which gives the buyer ( the owner or holder of the option ) the right , but not the obligation , to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specified strike price prior to or on a specified date , depending on the form of the option . The strike price may be set by reference to the spot price ( market price ) of the underlying security or commodity on the day an option is taken out , or it may be fixed at a discount or at a premium . The seller has the corresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction - to sell or buy - if the buyer ( owner ) exercises the option . An option that conveys to the owner the right to buy at a specific price is referred to as a call ; an option that conveys the right of the owner to sell at a specific price is referred to as a put . Both are commonly traded , but the call option is more frequently discussed . The seller may grant an option to a buyer as part of another transaction , such as a share issue or as part of an employee incentive scheme , otherwise a buyer would pay a premium to the seller for the option . A call option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below the market value of the underlying asset , while a put option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value . When an option is exercised , the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium , if any . When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised , the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller . In any case , the premium is income to the seller , and normally a capital loss to the buyer . The owner of an option may on-sell the option to a third party in a secondary market , in either an over-the-counter transaction or on an options exchange , depending on the option . The market price of an American-style option normally closely follows that of the underlying stock being the difference between the market price of the stock and the strike price of the option .",

  "/wiki/Intersex": "Intersex people are individuals born with any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes , gonads , sex hormones or genitals that , according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies . Such variations may involve genital ambiguity and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female . In the 19th and 20th centuries , some members of the medical literary community devised new nomenclature to attempt to classify the characteristics that they had observed . It was the first attempt at creating a taxonomic classification system of intersex conditions . Intersex people were categorized as either having true hermaphroditism , female pseudohermaphroditism , or male pseudohermaphroditism . These terms are no longer used : terms including the word hermaphrodite are considered to be misleading , stigmatizing , and scientifically specious in reference to humans . A hermaphrodite is now defined as an animal or plant having both male and female reproductive organs . In 1917 , Richard Goldschmidt created the term intersexuality to refer to a variety of physical sex ambiguities . In clinical settings , the term disorders of sex development ( DSD ) has been used since 2006 . This shift has been controversial since the label was introduced . Intersex people face stigmatization and discrimination from birth , or from discovery of an intersex trait , such as from puberty . This may include infanticide , abandonment and the stigmatization of families .",

  "/wiki/Free-speech": "Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation , censorship , or legal sanction . The term freedom of expression is sometimes used synonymously but includes any act of seeking , receiving , and imparting information or ideas , regardless of the medium used . Freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( UDHR ) and recognized in international human rights law in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) . Article 19 of the UDHR states that everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference and everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression ; this right shall include freedom to seek , receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds , regardless of frontiers , either orally , in writing or in print , in the form of art , or through any other media of his choice . The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries special duties and responsibilities and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions when necessary [ f ] or respect of the rights or reputation of others or [ f ] or the protection of national security or of public order ( order public ) , or of public health or morals . Freedom of speech and expression , therefore , may not be recognized as being absolute , and common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to libel , slander , obscenity , pornography , sedition , incitement , fighting words , classified information , copyright violation , trade secrets , food labeling , non-disclosure agreements , the right to privacy , dignity , the right to be forgotten , public security , and perjury . Justifications for such include the harm principle , proposed by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty , which suggests that : the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community , against his will , is to prevent harm to others . The idea of the offense principle is also used in the justification of speech limitations , describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society , considering factors such as extent , duration , motives of the speaker , and ease with which it could be avoided . With the evolution of the digital age , application of freedom of speech becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise , for example the Golden Shield Project , an initiative by Chinese government 's Ministry of Public Security that filters potentially unfavourable data from foreign countries .",
