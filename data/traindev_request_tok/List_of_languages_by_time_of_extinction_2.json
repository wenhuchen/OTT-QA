  "/wiki/Language_isolate": "A language isolate , in the absolute sense , is a natural language with no demonstrable genealogical ( or genetic ) relationship with other languages , one that has not been demonstrated to descend from an ancestor common with any other language . Language isolates are in effect language families consisting of a single language . Commonly cited examples include Ainu , Basque , Sumerian , Elamite , and Vedda , though in each case a minority of linguists claim to have demonstrated a relationship with other languages . Some sources use the term language isolate to indicate a branch of a larger family with only one surviving member . For instance , Albanian , Armenian and Greek are commonly called Indo-European isolates . While part of the Indo-European family , they do not belong to any established branch ( such as the Romance , Indo-Iranian , Celtic , Slavic or Germanic branches ) , but instead form independent branches . Similarly , within the Romance languages , Sardinian is a relative isolate . However , without a qualifier , isolate is understood to mean having no demonstrable genetic relationship to any other known language . Some languages once seen as isolates may be reclassified as small families . This happened with Japanese ( now included in the Japonic family along with Ryukyuan languages such as Okinawan ) and Korean in Koreanic languages with Jeju language . The Etruscan language of Italy has long been considered an isolate , but some have proposed that it is related to the so-called Tyrsenian languages , an extinct family of closely related ancient languages proposed by Helmut Rix in 1998 , including the Rhaetian language , formerly spoken in the central Alps , and the Lemnian language , formerly spoken on the Greek island of Lemnos . Language isolates may be seen as a special case of unclassified languages that remain unclassified even after extensive efforts .",

A large part of its eastern boundary is demarcated by the Mississippi River . Louisiana is the only U.S. state with political subdivisions termed parishes , which are equivalent to counties . The state 's capital is Baton Rouge , and its largest city is New Orleans . Much of the state 's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River , leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp . [ self-published source ] These contain a rich southern biota ; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets . There are also many species of tree frogs , and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish . In more elevated areas , fire is a natural process in the landscape and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas . These support an exceptionally large number of plant species , including many species of terrestrial orchids and carnivorous plants . Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state , including four that are federally recognized , ten that are state recognized , and four that have not received recognition .",

With about 7.5 million speakers , it comprises an independent branch within the Indo-European languages and is not closely related to any other language . First attested in the 15th century , it is the last Indo-European branch to appear in written records . This is one of the reasons why its still-unknown origin has long been a matter of dispute among linguists and historians . Albanian is considered to be the descendant of one of the Paleo-Balkan languages of antiquity . For more historical and geographical reasons than specifically linguistic ones , there are various modern historians and linguists who believe that the Albanian language may have descended from a southern Illyrian dialect spoken in much the same region in classical times . Alternative hypotheses hold that Albanian may have descended from Thracian or Daco-Moesian , other ancient languages spoken farther east than Illyrian . Not enough is known of these languages to completely prove or disprove the various hypotheses . The two main Albanian dialects , Gheg and Tosk which are primarily distinguished by phonological differences , are mutually intelligible , with Gheg spoken in the north and Tosk spoken in the south of the Shkumbin river . Their characteristics in the treatment of the native and loanwords from other languages , have led to the conclusion that the dialectal split occurred after Christianisation of the region ( 4th century AD ) and at the time of the Slavic migration to the Balkans , with the historic boundary between Gheg and Tosk being the Shkumbin which straddled the Jire\u010dek line . Standard Albanian is a standardised form of spoken Albanian based on the Tosk dialect .

  "/wiki/Pama-Nyungan_languages": "The Pama-Nyungan languages are the most widespread family of Australian Aboriginal languages , containing perhaps 300 languages . The name Pama-Nyungan is derived from the names of the two most widely separated groups , the Pama languages of the northeast and the Nyungan languages of the southwest . The words pama and nyunga mean man in their respective languages . The other language families indigenous to the continent of Australia are occasionally referred to , by exclusion , as non-Pama-Nyungan languages , though this is not a taxonomic term . The Pama-Nyungan family accounts for most of the geographic spread , most of the Aboriginal population , and the greatest number of languages . Most of the Pama-Nyungan languages are spoken by small ethnic groups of hundreds of speakers or fewer . The vast majority of languages , either due to disease or elimination of their speakers , have become extinct , and almost all remaining ones are endangered in some way . Only in the central inland portions of the continent do Pama-Nyungan languages remain spoken vigorously by the entire community . The Pama-Nyungan family was identified and named by Kenneth L. Hale , in his work on the classification of Native Australian languages . Hale 's research led him to the conclusion that of the Aboriginal Australian languages , one relatively closely interrelated family had spread and proliferated over most of the continent , while approximately a dozen other families were concentrated along the North coast .",

With an estimated population of 5.1 million as of 2019 [ update ] , it is Canada 's third-most populous province . The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria , established in 1843 , which gave rise to the City of Victoria , at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island . Subsequently , on the mainland , the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858-1866 ) was founded by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers , Columbia Detachment , in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush . Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia : he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's bulwark in the farthest west , and to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster , established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park , and designed the first version of the Coat of arms of British Columbia . Port Moody is named after him . In 1866 , Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia , and Victoria became the united colony 's capital . In 1871 , British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada . Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu ( Splendour without Diminishment ) . The capital of British Columbia is Victoria , the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada , named for Queen Victoria , who ruled during the creation of the original colonies .

Panama seceded in 1903 , leading to Colombia 's present borders . Beginning in the 1960s , the country suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence , both of which escalated in the 1990s . Since 2005 , there has been significant improvement in security , stability , and rule of law ."
