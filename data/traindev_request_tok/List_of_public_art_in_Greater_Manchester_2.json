  "/wiki/Manchester": "Manchester ( /\u02c8m\u00e6nt\u0283\u025bst\u0259r/ ) is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester , England , with a population of 547,627 as of 2018 ( 5th most populous English district ) . It lies within the United Kingdom 's second-most populous urban area , with a population of 2.9 million , and second-most populous metropolitan area , with a population of 3.3 million . It is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east , and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority for the city is Manchester City Council . The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It is historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated in the 20th century . The first to be included , Wythenshawe , was added to the city in 1931 . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and directly linking the city to the Irish Sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortune declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation , but the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration .",

  "/wiki/Manchester_Cenotaph": "Manchester Cenotaph is a war memorial in St Peter 's Square , Manchester , England . Manchester was late in commissioning a First World War memorial compared with most British towns and cities ; the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922 . The committee quickly achieved its target of raising \u00a310,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial . The preferred site in Albert Square would have required the removal and relocation of other statues and monuments , and was opposed by the city 's artistic bodies . The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens , an area already identified for a possible art gallery and library ; but in the interests of speedier delivery , the memorial committee settled on St Peter 's Square . The area within the square had been had been purchased by the City Council in 1906 , having been the site of the former St Peter 's Church ; whose sealed burial crypts remained with burials untouched and marked above ground by a memorial stone cross . Negotiations to remove these stalled so the construction of the cenotaph proceeded with the cross and burials in situ . Having picked a site , it was originally proposed to choose an architect by open competition , but the memorial committee was criticised in the local press when it reserved the right to overrule the judgement of the independent assessor . A sub-committee therefore approached Sir Edwin Lutyens directly , who produced , in a matter of weeks , a variation of his design for the Cenotaph in London . The memorial consists of a central cenotaph and a Stone of Remembrance flanked by twin obelisks , all features characteristic of Lutyens ' works . Raised steps either side of the Stone of Remembrance provided east-facing tribunes for the colour party in memorial parades . The cenotaph is topped by an effigy of a fallen soldier and decorated with relief carvings of the imperial crown , Manchester 's coat of arms and inscriptions commemorating the dead .",
