  "/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire": "The Holy Roman Empire ( Latin : Sacrum Imperium Romanum ; German : Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich ) , also known as Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation , was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in Western and Central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars . The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany , though it also included the neighboring Kingdom of Bohemia and Kingdom of Italy , plus numerous other territories , and soon after the Kingdom of Burgundy was added . Its size gradually diminished over time , particularly from 1648 onward , and by the time of its dissolution , it largely contained only German-speaking territories ( although Switzerland and East Prussia were not included ) , plus the Kingdom of Bohemia which was bordered by the German lands on three sides . At the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , most of the Holy Roman Empire was included in the German Confederation . On 25 December 800 , Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as Emperor , reviving the title in Western Europe , more than three centuries after the fall of the earlier ancient Western Roman Empire in 476 . The title continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and from 896 to 899 , after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant , Berengar I , in 924 . The title was revived again in 962 when Otto I was crowned emperor , fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries . Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire , while others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning . Scholars generally concur , however , in relating an evolution of the institutions and principles constituting the empire , describing a gradual assumption of the imperial title and role . The exact term Holy Roman Empire was not used until the 13th century , but the concept of translatio imperii , [ d ] the notion that he - the sovereign ruler - held supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of Rome , was fundamental to the prestige of the emperor . The office of Holy Roman Emperor was traditionally elective , although frequently controlled by dynasties . The mostly German prince-electors , the highest-ranking noblemen of the empire , usually elected one of their peers as King of the Romans , and he would later be crowned emperor by the Pope ; the tradition of papal coronations was discontinued in the 16th century .",

  "/wiki/Old_Swiss_Confederacy": "The Old Swiss Confederacy ( Modern German : Alte Eidgenossenschaft ; historically Eidgenossenschaft , after the Reformation also R\u00e9publique des Suisses , Res publica Helvetiorum Republic of the Swiss ) was a loose confederation of independent small states ( cantons , German Orte or St\u00e4nde ) within the Holy Roman Empire . It is the precursor of the modern state of Switzerland . It formed during the 14th century , from a nucleus in what is now Central Switzerland , expanding to include the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Berne by the middle of the century . This formed a rare union of rural and urban communes , all of which enjoyed imperial immediacy in the Holy Roman Empire . This confederation of eight cantons ( Acht Orte ) was politically and militarily successful for more than a century , culminating in the Burgundy Wars of the 1470s which established it as a power in the complicated political landscape dominated by France and the Habsburgs . Its success resulted in the addition of more confederates , increasing the number of cantons to thirteen ( Dreizehn Orte ) by 1513 . The confederacy pledged neutrality in 1647 ( under the threat of the Thirty Years ' War ) , although many Swiss served privately as mercenaries in the Italian Wars and during the Early Modern period . After the Swabian War of 1499 the confederacy was a de facto independent state throughout the early modern period , although still nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1648 when the Treaty of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years ' War . The Swiss Reformation divided the confederates into Reformed and Catholic parties , resulting in internal conflict from the 16th to the 18th centuries ; as a result , the federal diet ( Tagsatzung ) was often paralysed by hostility between the factions . The Swiss Confederacy fell to invasion by the French Revolutionary Army in 1798 , after which it became the short-lived Helvetic Republic .",

  "/wiki/Margraviate_of_Brandenburg": "The Margraviate of Brandenburg ( German : Markgrafschaft Brandenburg ) was a major principality of the Holy Roman Empire from 1157 to 1806 that played a pivotal role in the history of Germany and Central Europe . Brandenburg developed out of the Northern March founded in the territory of the Slavic Wends . It derived one of its names from this inheritance , the March of Brandenburg ( Mark Brandenburg ) . Its ruling margraves were established as prestigious prince-electors in the Golden Bull of 1356 , allowing them to vote in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor . The state thus became additionally known as Electoral Brandenburg or the Electorate of Brandenburg ( Kurbrandenburg or Kurf\u00fcrstentum Brandenburg ) . The House of Hohenzollern came to the throne of Brandenburg in 1415 . In 1417 , Frederick I moved its capital from Brandenburg an der Havel to Berlin . Under Hohenzollern leadership , Brandenburg grew rapidly in power during the 17th century and inherited the Duchy of Prussia . The resulting Brandenburg-Prussia was the predecessor of the Kingdom of Prussia , which became a leading German state during the 18th century . Although the electors ' highest title was King in/of Prussia , their power base remained in Brandenburg and its capital Berlin . The Margraviate of Brandenburg ended with the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 . It was replaced after the Napoleonic Wars with the Prussian Province of Brandenburg in 1815 .",

Found within the province of North Holland , Amsterdam is colloquially referred to as the Venice of the North , attributed by the large number of canals which form a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Amsterdam 's name derives from Amstelredamme , indicative of the city 's origin around a dam in the river Amstel . Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century , Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world in the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century and became the leading centre for finance and trade . In the 19th and 20th centuries , the city expanded , and many new neighbourhoods and suburbs were planned and built . The 17th-century canals of Amsterdam and the 19-20th century Defence Line of Amsterdam are on the UNESCO World Heritage List . Sloten , annexed in 1921 by the municipality of Amsterdam , is the oldest part of the city , dating to the 9th century . As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe , Amsterdam is considered an alpha-world city by the Globalization and World Cities ( GaWC ) study group . The city is also the cultural capital of the Netherlands . Many large Dutch institutions have their headquarters there , including Philips , AkzoNobel , TomTom and ING . Also , many of the world 's largest companies are based in Amsterdam or have established their European headquarters in the city , such as leading technology companies Uber , Netflix and Tesla .

It is Poland 's principal seaport and the centre of the country 's fourth-largest metropolitan area . The city is situated on the southern edge of Gda\u0144sk Bay on the Baltic Sea , in a conurbation with the city of Gdynia , the resort town of Sopot , and suburban communities ; these form a metropolitan area called the Tricity ( Tr\u00f3jmiasto ) , with a population approaching 1.4 million .

Together with the nearby port of Gdynia , Gda\u0144sk is also a notable industrial centre . The city 's history is complex , with periods of Polish , Prussian and German rule , and periods of autonomy or self-rule as a free city state . In the early-modern age , Gda\u0144sk was a royal city of Poland . It was considered the wealthiest and the largest city of Poland , before the 18th century rapid growth of Warsaw . In the late Middle Ages it was an important seaport and shipbuilding town and , in the 14th and 15th centuries , a member of the Hanseatic League . In the interwar period , owing to its multi-ethnic make-up and history , Gda\u0144sk lay in a disputed region between Poland and Germany , which became known as the Polish Corridor .

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula . Its territory also includes two archipelagoes : the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea . The African enclaves of Ceuta , Melilla , and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera make Spain the only European country to have a physical border with an African country ( Morocco ) . [ h ] Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory . The country 's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . With an area of 505,990 km2 ( 195,360 sq mi ) , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population ( about 47 million ) , Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union . Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Zaragoza , M\u00e1laga and Bilbao . Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek , Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp ( a ) n or Spania . At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",

  "/wiki/Polish_language": "Polish ( j\u0119zyk polski , [ 'j\u025b\u0303w\u0303z\u0268k \u02c8p\u0254lsk\u02b2i ] ( listen ) , polszczyzna or simply polski , [ \u02c8p\u0254lsk\u02b2i ] ( listen ) ) is a West Slavic language of the Lechitic group . It is spoken primarily in Poland and serves as the native language of the Poles . In addition to being an official language of Poland , it is also used by Polish minorities in other countries . There are over 50 million Polish-language speakers around the world and it is one of the official languages of the European Union . Polish is written with the standardized Polish alphabet , which has nine additions to the letters of the basic Latin script ( \u0105 , \u0107 , \u0119 , \u0142 , \u0144 , \u00f3 , \u015b , \u017a , \u017c ) . Among the major languages , it is most closely related to Slovak and Czech , but differs from other Slavic varieties in terms of pronunciation and general grammar . In addition , Polish was profoundly influenced by Germanic languages , most notably German , and Italic languages like Latin and French , which contributed to a large number of loanwords and similar grammatical structures . Polish currently has the largest number of speakers of the West Slavic group and is also the second most widely spoken Slavic language . Historically , Polish was a lingua franca , important both diplomatically and academically in Central and Eastern Europe . Today , Polish is spoken by over 38.5 million people as their first language in Poland . It is also spoken as a second language in Northern Czech Republic and Slovakia , western parts of Belarus and Ukraine as well as in Central-Eastern Lithuania and Latvia . Because of the emigration from Poland during different time periods , most notably after World War II , millions of Polish speakers can be found in countries such as Canada , Argentina , Brazil , Israel , Australia , the United Kingdom and the United States .",
  "/wiki/Krak\u00f3w": "Krak\u00f3w ( /\u02c8kr\u00e6ka\u028a , -ko\u028a/ , also US : /\u02c8kre\u026ak- , \u02c8kr\u0251\u02d0ka\u028a/ , UK : /\u02c8kr\u00e6k\u0252f/ , Polish : [ \u02c8krakuf ] ( listen ) ) , traditionally known in English as Cracow , is the second largest and one of the oldest cities in Poland . Situated on the Vistula River in Lesser Poland Province , the city dates back to the 7th century . Krak\u00f3w was the official capital of Poland until 1596 and has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Polish academic , economic , cultural and artistic life . Cited as one of Europe 's most beautiful cities , its Old Town was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The city has grown from a Stone Age settlement to Poland 's second most important city . It began as a hamlet on Wawel Hill and was already being reported as a busy trading centre of Central Europe in 965 . With the establishment of new universities and cultural venues at the emergence of the Second Polish Republic in 1918 and throughout the 20th century , Krak\u00f3w reaffirmed its role as a major national academic and artistic centre . The city has a population of about 770,000 , with approximately 8 million additional people living within a 100 km ( 62 mi ) radius of its main square . After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany at the start of World War II , the newly defined Distrikt Krakau ( Krak\u00f3w District ) became the capital of Germany 's General Government . The Jewish population of the city was forced into a walled zone known as the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto , from which they were sent to German extermination camps such as the nearby Auschwitz never to return , and the Nazi concentration camps like P\u0142asz\u00f3w . However , the city was spared from destruction and major bombing . In 1978 , Karol Wojty\u0142a , archbishop of Krak\u00f3w , was elevated to the papacy as Pope John Paul II - the first ever Slavic pope , and the first non-Italian pope in 455 years .",
  "/wiki/Polish\u2013Lithuanian_Commonwealth": "The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth - formally , the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and , after 1791 , the Commonwealth of Poland - was a dual state , a bi-confederation of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch , who was both King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania . It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- to 17th-century Europe . At its largest territorial extent , in the early 17th century , the Commonwealth covered almost 400,000 square miles ( 1,000,000 km2 ) and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million . Polish and Latin were the two co-official languages . The Commonwealth was established by the Union of Lublin in July 1569 , but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had been in a de facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania 's Grand Duke Jogaila , who was crowned King jure uxoris W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o of Poland . The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the state 's size and the Commonwealth collapsed as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 . The Union possessed many features unique among contemporary states . Its political system was characterized by strict checks upon monarchical power . These checks were enacted by a legislature ( sejm ) controlled by the nobility ( szlachta ) . This idiosyncratic system was a precursor to modern concepts of democracy , constitutional monarchy , and federation . Although the two component states of the Commonwealth were formally equal , Poland was the dominant partner in the union . The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was marked by high levels of ethnic diversity and by relative religious tolerance , guaranteed by the Warsaw Confederation Act 1573 ; [ a ] however , the degree of religious freedom varied over time .",

Mantua is surrounded on three sides by artificial lakes , created during the 12th century as the city 's defence system . These lakes receive water from the Mincio River , a tributary of the Po River which descends from Lake Garda . The three lakes are called Lago Superiore , Lago di Mezzo , and Lago Inferiore ( Upper , Middle , and Lower Lakes , respectively ) . A fourth lake , Lake Pajolo , which once served as a defensive water ring around the city , dried up at the end of the 18th century .",
