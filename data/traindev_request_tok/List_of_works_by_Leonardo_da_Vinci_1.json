  "/wiki/Pompeo_Leoni": "Leone Leoni ( ca . 1509 - 22 July 1590 ) was an Italian sculptor of international outlook who travelled in Italy , Germany , Austria , France , Spain and the Netherlands . Leoni is regarded as the finest of the Cinquecento medallists . He made his reputation in commissions he received from the Habsburg monarchs Charles V , Holy Roman Emperor and Philip II of Spain . His usual medium was bronze , although he also worked in marble and alabaster , carved gemstones and probably left some finished work in wax ( in which many of his sculptures were modelled ) , as well as designing coins . He mainly produced portraits , and was repeatedly used by the Spanish , and also the Austrian , Habsburgs .",

  "/wiki/British_Museum": "The British Museum , in the Bloomsbury area of London , United Kingdom , is a public institution dedicated to human history , art and culture . Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence , having been widely sourced during the era of the British Empire . It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present . [ a ] It was the first public national museum in the world . The British Museum was established in 1753 , largely based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane . It first opened to the public in 1759 , in Montagu House , on the site of the current building . Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions , the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881 . In 1973 , the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum , but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997 . The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital , Culture , Media and Sport , and as with all national museums in the UK it charges no admission fee , except for loan exhibitions . Its ownership of some of its most famous objects originating in other countries is disputed and remains the subject of international controversy , most notably in the case of the Parthenon Marbles .",

  "/wiki/Perpetual_motion": "Perpetual motion is the motion of bodies that continues forever . A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that can do work indefinitely without an energy source . This kind of machine is impossible , as it would violate the first or second law of thermodynamics . These laws of thermodynamics apply regardless of the size of the system . For example , the motions and rotations of celestial bodies such as planets may appear perpetual , but are actually subject to many processes that slowly dissipate their kinetic energy , such as solar wind , interstellar medium resistance , gravitational radiation and thermal radiation , so they will not keep moving forever . Thus , machines that extract energy from finite sources will not operate indefinitely , because they are driven by the energy stored in the source , which will eventually be exhausted . A common example is devices powered by ocean currents , whose energy is ultimately derived from the Sun , which itself will eventually burn out . Machines powered by more obscure sources have been proposed , but are subject to the same inescapable laws , and will eventually wind down . In 2017 , new states of matter , time crystals , were discovered in which on a microscopic scale the component atoms are in continual repetitive motion , thus satisfying the literal definition of perpetual motion . However , these do not constitute perpetual motion machines in the traditional sense or violate thermodynamic laws because they are in their quantum ground state , so no energy can be extracted from them ; they have motion without energy .",
  "/wiki/Topology": "In mathematics , topology ( from the Greek \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 , 'place ' , and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 , 'study ' ) is concerned with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations , such as stretching , twisting , crumpling and bending , but not tearing or gluing . A topological space is a set endowed with a structure , called a topology , which allows defining continuous deformation of subspaces , and , more generally , all kinds of continuity . Euclidean spaces , and , more generally , metric spaces are examples of a topological space , as any distance or metric defines a topology . The deformations that are considered in topology are homeomorphisms and homotopies . A property that is invariant under such deformations is a topological property . Basic examples of topological properties are : the dimension , which allows distinguishing between a line and a surface ; compactness , which allows distinguishing between a line and a circle ; connectedness , which allows distinguishing a circle from two non-intersecting circles . The ideas underlying topology go back to Gottfried Leibniz , who in the 17th century envisioned the geometria situs and analysis situs . Leonhard Euler 's Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg problem and polyhedron formula are arguably the field 's first theorems . The term topology was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19th century , although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed .",

  "/wiki/Euclidean_geometry": "Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid , which he described in his textbook on geometry : the Elements . Euclid 's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms , and deducing many other propositions ( theorems ) from these . Although many of Euclid 's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians , Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system . The Elements begins with plane geometry , still taught in secondary school ( high school ) as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof . It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions . Much of the Elements states results of what are now called algebra and number theory , explained in geometrical language . For more than two thousand years , the adjective Euclidean was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived . Euclid 's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious ( with the possible exception of the parallel postulate ) that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute , often metaphysical , sense . Today , however , many other self-consistent non-Euclidean geometries are known , the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century . An implication of Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity is that physical space itself is not Euclidean , and Euclidean space is a good approximation for it only over short distances ( relative to the strength of the gravitational field ) . Euclidean geometry is an example of synthetic geometry , in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects such as points and lines , to propositions about those objects , all without the use of coordinates to specify those objects . This is in contrast to analytic geometry , which uses coordinates to translate geometric propositions into algebraic formulas .",

He was an illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI . After initially entering the church and becoming a cardinal on his father 's election to the Papacy , he became , after the death of his brother in 1498 , the first person to resign a cardinalate . He served as a condottiero for the King of France Louis XII around 1500 and occupied Milan and Naples during the Italian Wars . At the same time he carved out a state for himself in Central Italy , but after his father 's death he was unable to retain power for long .

The northwestern border runs approximately from the mouth of the river Astura along the river and from its upper reaches to Cori in the Monti Lepini . The former marsh is a low tract of mainly agricultural land created by draining and filling , separated from the sea by sand dunes . The area amounts to about 80,000 ha ( 800 km2 ; 310 sq mi ) . The Via Appia , a Roman military road constructed in 312 BC , crosses the inland side of the former marsh in a long , straight stretch flanked by trees . Before then , travelers had to use the Via Latina along the flanks of the mountains ; Terracina could not be reached across the marsh . Further southward along the coast as far as Minturno is another stretch of former coastal marsh called the South Pontino , the largest section being between Terracina and Sperlonga , as far inland as Fondi . It was part of ancient Latium adiectum and still belongs to Lazio . Bordered by the Aurunci Mountains , this land is mainly reclaimed , as well , but the more frequent incursion of hills permitted more dense settlements . Leaving Terracina , the Via Appia crosses it , as well . The marsh was an extensive alluvial plain at about sea level ( some above , some below ) created by the failure of the streams draining the mountains to find clearly defined outlets to the sea through the barrier dunes . Above sea level , it was a forested swamp ; below , it was mud flats and pools .",
