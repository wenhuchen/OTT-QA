  "/wiki/Video_game_developer": "A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development - the process and related disciplines of creating video games . A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines , such as programming , design , art , testing , etc . Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support . Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games . A developer may specialize in a certain video game console ( such as Nintendo 's Nintendo Switch , Microsoft 's Xbox One , Sony 's PlayStation 4 ) , or may develop for a number of systems ( including personal computers and mobile devices ) . [ citation needed ] Video game developers specialize in certain types of games ( such as role-playing video games or first-person shooters ) . Some focus on porting games from one system to another , or translating games from one language to another . Less commonly , some do software development work in addition to games . Most video game publishers maintain development studios ( such as Electronic Arts 's EA Canada , Square Enix 's studios , Activision 's Radical Entertainment , Nintendo EAD and Sony 's Polyphony Digital and Naughty Dog ) . However , since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as publishers rather than developers . Developers may be private as well ( such as how Bungie was , the company which developed the Halo series exclusive to Microsoft 's Xbox ) .",
  "/wiki/Video_game_publisher": "A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that have been developed either internally by the publisher or externally by a video game developer . They often finance the development , sometimes by paying a video game developer ( the publisher calls this external development ) and sometimes by paying an internal staff of developers called a studio . The large video game publishers also distribute the games they publish , while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies ( or larger video game publishers ) to distribute the games they publish . Other functions usually performed by the publisher include deciding on and paying for any licenses used by the game ; paying for localization ; layout , printing , and possibly the writing of the user manual ; and the creation of graphic design elements such as the box design . Some large publishers with vertical structure also own publishing subsidiaries ( labels ) . Large publishers may also attempt to boost efficiency across all internal and external development teams by providing services such as sound design and code packages for commonly needed functionality . Because the publisher often finances development , it usually tries to manage development risk with a staff of producers or project managers to monitor the progress of the developer , critique ongoing development , and assist as necessary . Most video games created by an external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties . These advances are paid when the developer reaches certain stages of development , called milestones .",

  "/wiki/EarthBound": "EarthBound ( known as Mother 2 in Japan ) [ nb 1 ] is a role-playing video game developed by Ape Inc. and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . The second entry in the Mother series , it was first released in Japan in August 1994 , and in North America in June 1995 . As Ness and his party of four , the player travels the world to collect melodies from eight Sanctuaries in order to defeat the evil alien force Giygas . EarthBound had a lengthy development period that spanned five years . Its returning staff from Mother ( 1989 ) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer Satoru Iwata , as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka , who incorporated a diverse range of styles into the soundtrack , including salsa , reggae , and dub . Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original Mother , and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team . Originally scheduled for release in January 1993 , the game was completed around May 1994 . Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture , EarthBound subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a real world setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre . Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone ; for example , the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues , experiences in-game hallucinations , and battles piles of vomit , taxi cabs , and walking nooses . For its American release , the game was marketed with a $ 2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed this game stinks . Additionally , the game 's puns and humor were reworked by localizer Marcus Lindblom , and the title was changed from Mother 2 to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to . Initial reviewers had little praise for EarthBound in the United States , where it sold half as many copies as in Japan .",
