  "/wiki/Riley_RM": "The Riley RM Series is an executive car which was produced by Riley from 1945 to 1955 . It was the last model developed independently by Riley prior to the 1952 merger of Riley 's still new owner Nuffield , with Austin to form BMC . The RM series was originally produced in Coventry , but in 1949 production moved to the MG works at Abingdon . The RM models were marketed as the Riley 1\u00bd Litre and the Riley 2\u00bd Litre . There were three types of RM vehicles produced . All used Riley engines with four cylinders in-line , hemispherical combustion chambers and twin camshafts mounted high at the sides of the cylinder block . The RMA was a large saloon , and was replaced by the RME . Both used a 1.5 L ( 1496 cc ) 12 hp ( RAC Rating ) , developed before WWII . The RMB was a longer car : it was replaced by the RMF . Both cars used a larger engine , new in 1937 , a 2.5 L 16 hp ( RAC Rating ) Big Four . The RMC and RMD were limited-production cars , an open 2 or 3-seater Roadster and a 4-seater Drophead .",
  "/wiki/Triumph_Motor_Company": "The Triumph Motor Company was a British car and motor manufacturing company in the 19th and 20th centuries . The marque had its origins in 1885 when Siegfried Bettmann of Nuremberg formed S. Bettmann & Co. and started importing bicycles from Europe and selling them under his own trade name in London . The trade name became Triumph the following year , and in 1887 Bettmann was joined by a partner , Moritz Schulte , also from Germany . In 1889 , the businessmen started producing their own bicycles in Coventry , England . The company was acquired by Leyland Motors in 1960 , ultimately becoming part of the giant conglomerate British Leyland ( BL ) in 1968 , where the Triumph brand was absorbed into BL 's Specialist Division alongside former Leyland stablemates Rover and Jaguar . Triumph-badged vehicles were produced by BL until 1984 when the Triumph marque was retired , where it remained dormant under the auspices of BL 's successor company Rover Group . The rights to the Triumph marque are currently owned by BMW , who purchased the Rover Group in 1994 .",

  "/wiki/Austin_A40_Devon": "The A40 Devon ( and similar 2-door A40 Dorset ) are automobiles that were marketed by Austin from 1947 to 1952 - the first post-war saloons to be produced by Austin - featuring a mix of old and new technologies . They were previewed by the UK press at the Paris Motor Show on 22 October 1947 , who expressed immediate disappointment at the car 's conservative appearance . More than 450,000 were built before the model 's replacement in 1952 by the Austin A40 Somerset .",
  "/wiki/Standard_Vanguard": "The Standard Vanguard is a car which was produced by the Standard Motor Company in Coventry , England , from 1947 to 1963 . The car was announced in July 1947 , was completely new , with no resemblance to the previous models , and , designed in 1945 , it was Standard 's first post-Second World War car and intended for export around the world . It was also the first model to carry the new Standard badge , which was a heavily stylised representation of the wings of a griffin . In the wake of the Second World War , many potential customers in the UK and in English-speaking export markets had recently experienced several years of military or naval service , and therefore a car name related to the British Navy carried a greater resonance than it would for later generations . The name of the Standard Vanguard recalled HMS Vanguard , the last of the British Navy 's battleships , launched in 1944 amid much media attention ; permission to use the name involved Standard in extensive negotiations with senior Royal Navy personnel . The styling of the car was intentionally modelled on American lines by Walter Belgrave . Early cars had deep doors that blended into the bottom of the sills . The Vanguard was first exhibited to the public at the Brussels Motor Show in February 1948 . It began to come off the assembly lines in the middle of 1948 but all production was allotted to the export trade . An estate car and a utility pick up version were announced in September , and then a 12 cwt delivery van . Aprons were fitted over the Vanguard 's rear wheels from September 1949 . In 1950 , the Vanguard and the Triumph Renown were the first cars to be fitted with a Laycock de Normanville overdrive .",
  "/wiki/Hillman_Minx": "The Hillman Minx was a mid-sized family car that British car maker Hillman produced from 1931 to 1970 . There were many versions of the Minx over that period , as well as badge-engineered variants sold by Humber , Singer , and Sunbeam . From the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s , the Minx and its derivatives were the greatest-volume sellers of the Audax family of cars from Rootes , which also included the Singer Gazelle and Sunbeam Rapier . The final version of the Minx was the New Minx launched in 1967 , which was part of the Arrow family and essentially a basic version of the Hillman Hunter . Generally , the Minx was available in four-door saloon and estate forms , with a 1496-cc engine . The Hillman Super Minx was a slightly larger model offered during the Audax era . Throughout the life of the Minx , there was usually an estate version - and , from 1954 to 1965 , a short-wheelbase estate , the Hillman Husky , and a van derivative known as the Commer Cob . The Minx model name was revived briefly - along with the Rapier name , as applied to the Sunbeam Rapier version of the Audax family - as a special edition late in the life of the Talbot Alpine / Talbot Solara cars , produced by Chrysler Europe after its takeover of the Rootes Group .",
