  "/wiki/Harold_Wilson": "James Harold Wilson , Baron Wilson of Rievaulx , KG , OBE , PC , FRS , FSS ( 11 March 1916 - 24 May 1995 ) , was a British Labour politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1964 to 1970 and 1974 to 1976 . Entering Parliament in 1945 , Wilson was appointed a parliamentary secretary in the Attlee ministry and rose quickly through the ministerial ranks ; he became Secretary for Overseas Trade in 1947 and was elevated to Cabinet shortly thereafter as President of the Board of Trade . In opposition to the next Conservative government , he served as Shadow Chancellor ( 1955-1961 ) and Shadow Foreign Secretary ( 1961-1963 ) . After Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell died suddenly in 1963 , Wilson won the subsequent leadership election . After narrowly winning the 1964 general election , Wilson saw an increased majority in a snap election in 1966 . Wilson 's first period as Prime Minister coincided with a period of low unemployment and relative economic prosperity , though hindered by significant problems with Britain 's external balance of payments . In 1969 he sent British troops to Northern Ireland . After losing the 1970 election to Edward Heath , he spent four years as Leader of the Opposition before the February 1974 election resulted in a hung parliament . After Heath 's talks with the Liberals broke down , Wilson returned to power as leader of a minority government until another general election in October , resulting in a narrow Labour victory . A period of economic crisis had begun to hit most Western countries , and in 1976 Wilson suddenly announced his resignation as Prime Minister . Wilson 's approach to socialism was moderate compared with others in his party at the time , emphasising programmes aimed at increasing opportunity in society through relatively indirect means rather than the more direct socialist goal of promoting wider public ownership of industry and workers ' control of production . He took little action to pursue the Labour Party constitution 's stated dedication to public ownership as a stepping stone towards this goal , though he did not formally disavow it .",
  "/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom": "The prime minister of the United Kingdom ( informally abbreviated to PM ) , until 1801 known as the prime minister of Great Britain , is the head of government of the United Kingdom . The prime minister directs both the executive and the legislature , and together with their Cabinet is accountable to the monarch , to Parliament , to their party , and ultimately to the electorate , for the government 's policies and actions . The office of Prime Minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document but exists only by long-established convention , whereby the reigning monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons ; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber . The position of Prime Minister was not created ; it evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament , political developments , and accidents of history . The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective . The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement ( 1688-1720 ) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament . Although the sovereign was not stripped of the ancient prerogative powers and legally remained the head of government , politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a prime minister who could command a majority in Parliament . By the 1830s , the Westminster system of government ( or cabinet government ) had emerged ; the prime minister had become primus inter pares or the first among equals in the Cabinet and the head of government in the United Kingdom . The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties , the introduction of mass communication and photography . By the start of the 20th century the modern premiership had emerged ; the office had become the pre-eminent position in the constitutional hierarchy vis-\u00e0-vis the Sovereign , Parliament and Cabinet . Prior to 1902 , the prime minister sometimes came from the House of Lords , provided that his government could form a majority in the Commons . However as the power of the aristocracy waned during the 19th century the convention developed that the prime minister should always sit as a Member of Parliament ( MP ) in the lower house , making them answerable only to the Commons in Parliament .",

Before becoming Chancellor , he had served as Minister of Defence ( 1969-1972 ) and as Minister of Finance ( 1972-1974 ) . In the latter role he gained credit for his financial policies . He had also served briefly as Minister of Economics and as acting Foreign Minister . As Chancellor , he focused on international affairs , seeking political unification of Europe in partnership with the United States and issuing proposals that led to the NATO Double-Track Decision in 1979 to deploy US Pershing II missiles to Europe . He was an energetic diplomat who sought European co-operation and international economic co-ordination and was the leading force in creating the European Monetary System in 1978 . He was re-elected chancellor in 1976 and 1980 , but his coalition fell apart in 1982 with the switch by his coalition allies , the Free Democratic Party . He retired from Parliament in 1986 , after clashing with the SPD 's left wing , who opposed him on defence and economic issues . In 1986 he was a leading proponent of European monetary union and a European Central Bank .",
  "/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany_(Federal_Republic)": "The title Chancellor has designated different offices in the history of Germany . It is currently used for the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany ( German : Bundeskanzler ( in ) der Bundesrepublik Deutschland ) , the head of government of Germany . The term , dating from the Early Middle Ages , is derived from the Latin term cancellarius . The modern office of chancellor evolved from the position created for Otto von Bismarck in the North German Confederation in 1867 ; this federal state evolved into a German nation-state with the 1871 Unification of Germany . The role of the chancellor has varied greatly throughout Germany 's modern history . Since the founding of the Federal Republic , the chancellor has been the country 's effective leader , although in formal protocol , the Bundespr\u00e4sident and Bundestagspr\u00e4sident are ranked higher . In German politics , the chancellor is the equivalent of a prime minister in many other countries . The chancellor is elected by the Bundestag . The current , official title in German is Bundeskanzler ( in ) , which means Federal Chancellor , and is sometimes shortened to Kanzler ( in ) . The 8th and current chancellor of the Federal Republic is Angela Merkel , who was elected in 2005 and re-elected in 2009 , 2013 and 2017 , serving her fourth term in office . She is the first woman to be elected chancellor . Merkel is also the first chancellor elected since the fall of the Berlin Wall to have been raised in the former East Germany ( GDR ) .",

His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada 's third longest-serving Prime Minister , behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald . Trudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer , intellectual , and activist in Quebec politics . He joined the Liberal Party of Canada and was elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1965 , quickly being appointed as Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson 's Parliamentary Secretary . In 1967 , he was appointed Minister of Justice . Trudeau 's outgoing personality caused a media sensation , inspiring Trudeaumania , and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968 , when he was appointed Prime Minister of Canada . From the late 1960s until the early 1980s , Trudeau 's personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life . After his appointment as Prime Minister , he won the 1968 , 1972 and 1974 elections , before narrowly losing in 1979 . He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards , in 1980 , and eventually retired from politics shortly before the 1984 election . Despite his personal motto , Reason before passion , his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office . Admirers praised what they consider to be the force of Trudeau 's intellect and his political acumen , maintaining national unity over the Quebec sovereignty movement , suppressing a Quebec terrorist crisis , fostering a pan-Canadian identity , and in achieving sweeping institutional reform , including the implementation of official bilingualism , patriation of the Constitution , and the establishment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Critics accused him of arrogance , of economic mismanagement , and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Quebec and the economy of the Prairies .",

He was appointed to the party 's frontbench in 1988 and became Shadow Home Secretary in 1992 . He became Leader of the Opposition on his election as Labour Party leader in 1994 , following the sudden death of his predecessor , John Smith . Under Blair , the party used the phrase New Labour to distance itself from previous Labour politics and the traditional idea of socialism . He declared support for the Third Way - politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent , advocating social justice , cohesion , the equal worth of each citizen , and equal opportunity . Despite opposition from Labour 's hard left , he removed the party 's formal commitment to the nationalisation of the economy , weakened trade union influence in the party , and committed to the free market and the European Union .",

After serving as prime minister under Dmitry Medvedev , Putin announced he would seek a third term as president , and won the March 2012 election with 64% of the vote . Falling oil prices coupled with international sanctions imposed at the beginning of 2014 after Russia 's annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Eastern Ukraine led to GDP shrinking by 3.7% in 2015 , though the Russian economy rebounded in 2016 with 0.3% GDP growth and the recession officially ended . Putin gained 76% of the March 2018 election and was re-elected for a six-year term that will end in 2024 . Under Putin 's leadership , Russia has experienced democratic backsliding .",
