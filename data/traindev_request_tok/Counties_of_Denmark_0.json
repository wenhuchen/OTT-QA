Tourism is also important during the summer months . The island is home to an especially large number of Denmark 's round churches . The island is known as solskins\u00f8en ( Sunshine Island ) because of its weather and klippe\u00f8en ( Rock Island ) because of its geology , which consists of granite , except along the southern coast . The heat from the summer is stored in the rock formations and the weather is quite warm until October . As a result of the climate , a local variety of the common fig , known as Bornholm 's Diamond , can grow locally on the island . The island 's topography consists of dramatic rock formations in the north ( unlike the rest of Denmark , which is mostly gentle rolling hills ) sloping down towards pine and deciduous forests ( greatly affected by storms in the 1950s ) , farmland in the middle and sandy beaches in the south . Strategically located in the Baltic Sea , Bornholm has been fought over for centuries . Usually it had been ruled by Denmark , but also by Sweden and L\u00fcbeck , Germany . The ruin of Hammershus , at the northwestern tip of the island , is the largest medieval fortress in northern Europe , testament to the importance of its location .",
