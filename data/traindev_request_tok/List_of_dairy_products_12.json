  "/wiki/Malai": "Malai is a type of clotted cream , originating from the Indian subcontinent , used in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent , especially , in regards to sweets from the Indian subcontinent . It is made by heating non-homogenized whole milk to about 80 \u00b0C ( 180 \u00b0F ) for about one hour and then allowing to cool . A thick yellowish layer of fat and coagulated proteins forms on the surface , which is skimmed off . The process is usually repeated to remove most of the fat . Malai has about 55% butterfat . Buffalo milk is thought to produce better malai because of its high fat content . Buffalo milk with fat contents varying from 5 to 12% is heated and boiled and then allowed to cool up to 4 \u00b0Celsius for best results . Similarly cow 's milk with milk fat from 3 to 5% is boiled and cooled to make malai .",
  "/wiki/India": "India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat ) , officially the Republic of India ( Hindi : Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya ) , is a country in South Asia . It is the seventh-largest country by area , the second-most populous country , and the most populous democracy in the world . Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",
  "/wiki/Clotted_cream": "Clotted cream ( Cornish : dehen molys , sometimes called scalded , clouted , Devonshire or Cornish cream ) is a thick cream made by indirectly heating full-cream cow 's milk using steam or a water bath and then leaving it in shallow pans to cool slowly . During this time , the cream content rises to the surface and forms clots or clouts . It forms an essential part of a cream tea . Although its origin is uncertain , the cream 's production is commonly associated with dairy farms in southwest England and in particular the counties of Cornwall and Devon . The current largest commercial producer in the United Kingdom is Rodda 's at Scorrier , Redruth , Cornwall , which can produce up to 25 tons of clotted cream a day . In 1998 the term Cornish clotted cream became a Protected Designation of Origin ( PDO ) by European Union directive , as long as the milk is produced in Cornwall and the minimum fat content is 55% .",

A major religious hub in India , it is the holiest of the seven sacred cities ( Sapta Puri ) in Hinduism and Jainism , and played an important role in the development of Buddhism and Ravidassia . Varanasi lies along National Highway 2 and is served by Varanasi Junction railway station and Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport . Varanasi grew as an important industrial centre famous for its muslin and silk fabrics , perfumes , ivory works , and sculpture . Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon , The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma , at nearby Sarnath . The city 's religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century , when Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi . During the Muslim rule through the Middle Ages , the city continued as an important centre of Hindu devotion , pilgrimage , mysticism and poetry which further contributed to its reputation as a centre of cultural importance and religious education . Tulsidas wrote his epic poem on Rama 's life called Ram Charit Manas in Varanasi . Several other major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi , including Kabir and Ravidas . Guru Nanak visited Varanasi for Maha Shivaratri in 1507 , a trip that played a large role in the founding of Sikhism . In the 16th century , Varanasi experienced a cultural revival under the Mughal emperor Akbar who patronised the city , and built two large temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu , though much of modern Varanasi was built during the 18th century , by the Maratha and Brahmin kings . The Kingdom of Benares was given official status by the Mughals in 1737 , and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947 .",

  "/wiki/Saffron": "Saffron ( pronounced /\u02c8s\u00e6fr\u0259n/ or /\u02c8s\u00e6fr\u0252n/ ) is a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus , commonly known as the saffron crocus . The vivid crimson stigma and styles , called threads , are collected and dried for use mainly as a seasoning and colouring agent in food . Saffron has long been the world 's most costly spice by weight . Although some doubts remain on its origin , it is believed that saffron originated in Iran . However , Greece and Mesopotamia have also been suggested as the possible region of origin of this plant : Harold McGee states that it was domesticated in or near Greece during the Bronze Age . C. sativus is possibly a triploid form of Crocus cartwrightianus , which is itself native to Greece and Crete . Saffron crocus slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia and was later brought to parts of North Africa , North America , and Oceania . Saffron 's taste and iodoform- or hay-like fragrance result from the phytochemicals , picrocrocin and safranal . It also contains a carotenoid pigment , crocin , which imparts a rich golden-yellow hue to dishes and textiles . Its recorded history is attested in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical treatise , and has been traded and used for over thousands of years . In the 21st century , Iran produces some 90% of the world total for saffron . At US $ 5,000 per kg or higher , saffron is the world 's most expensive spice .",

The contemporary name \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576 ( Hayastan ) became popular in the Middle Ages by addition of the Persian suffix -stan ( place ) . [ citation needed ] . However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos , Faustus of Byzantium , Ghazar Parpetsi , Koryun , and Sebeos . The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk ( \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f ) , the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah , who , according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene ( Movsis Khorenatsi ) , defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region . The further origin of the name is uncertain . It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated , Hittite vassal states - the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi ( 1600-1200 BC ) . The exonym Armenia is attested in the Old Persian Behistun Inscription ( 515 BC ) as Armina ( ) .

  "/wiki/Milk": "Milk is a nutrient-rich , white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals . It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals ( including humans who are breastfed ) before they are able to digest other types of food . Early-lactation milk contains colostrum , which carries the mother 's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases . It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose . Interspecies consumption of milk is not uncommon , particularly among humans , many of whom consume the milk of other mammals . As an agricultural product , milk , also called dairy milk , is extracted from farm animals during or soon after pregnancy . Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011 , from 260 million dairy cows . India is the world 's largest producer of milk , and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder , yet it exports few other milk products . The ever-increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future . New Zealand , Germany and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products . China and Russia were the world 's largest importers of milk and milk products until 2016 when both countries became self-sufficient , contributing to a worldwide glut of milk . Throughout the world , more than six billion people consume milk and milk products .",
  "/wiki/Mammary_gland": "A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in humans and other mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring . Mammals get their name from the Latin word mamma , breast . The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates ( for example , humans and chimpanzees ) , the udder in ruminants ( for example , cows , goats , and deer ) , and the dugs of other animals ( for example , dogs and cats ) . Lactorrhea , the occasional production of milk by the glands , can occur in any mammal , but in most mammals , lactation , the production of enough milk for nursing , occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years . It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids . In a few mammalian species , male lactation can occur . With humans male lactation can occur only under specific circumstances .",
  "/wiki/Mammal": "Mammals ( from Latin mamma breast ) are vertebrate animals constituting the class Mammalia ( /m\u0259\u02c8me\u026ali\u0259/ ) , and characterized by the presence of mammary glands which in females ( and sometimes males ) produce milk for feeding ( nursing ) their young , a neocortex ( a region of the brain ) , fur or hair , and three middle ear bones . These characteristics distinguish them from reptiles and birds , from which they diverged in the late Triassic , 201-227 million years ago . There are around 5,450 species of mammals . The largest orders are the rodents , bats and Soricomorpha ( shrews and others ) . The next three are the Primates ( apes , monkeys , and others ) , the Cetartiodactyla ( cetaceans and even-toed ungulates ) , and the Carnivora ( cats , dogs , seals , and others ) . Like birds , mammals are endothermic . The trait evolved independently in these two classes and is an example of convergent evolution . In terms of cladistics , which reflects evolutionary history , mammals are the only living members of the Synapsida ; this clade , together with Sauropsida ( reptiles and birds ) together constitute the larger Amniota clade . The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs , a group that included the non-mammalian Dimetrodon . At the end of the Carboniferous period around 300 million years ago , this group diverged from the sauropsid line that led to today 's reptiles and birds . The line following the stem group Sphenacodontia split into several diverse groups of non-mammalian synapsids - sometimes incorrectly referred to as mammal-like reptiles - before giving rise to Therapsida in the Early Permian period . The modern mammalian orders arose in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era , after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs , and have been among the dominant terrestrial animal groups from 66 million years ago to the present .",
  "/wiki/Nutrition": "Nutrition is the science that interprets the nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance , growth , reproduction , health and disease of an organism . It includes food intake , absorption , assimilation , biosynthesis , catabolism and excretion . The diet of an organism is what it eats , which is largely determined by the availability and palatability of foods . For humans , a healthy diet includes preparation of food and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation , heat or leaching , and that reduces risk of foodborne illnesses . The seven major classes of human nutrients are carbohydrates , fats , fiber , minerals , proteins , vitamins , and water . Nutrients can be grouped as either macronutrients or micronutrients ( needed in small quantities ) . In humans , an unhealthy diet can cause deficiency-related diseases such as blindness , anemia , scurvy , preterm birth , stillbirth and cretinism , or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome ; and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and osteoporosis . Undernutrition can lead to wasting in acute cases , and the stunting of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition .",
  "/wiki/Digestion": "Digestion is the breakdown of large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble food molecules so that they can be absorbed into the watery blood plasma . In certain organisms , these smaller substances are absorbed through the small intestine into the blood stream . Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down : mechanical and chemical digestion . The term mechanical digestion refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes . In chemical digestion , enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use . In the human digestive system , food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication ( chewing ) , a form of mechanical digestion , and the wetting contact of saliva . Saliva , a liquid secreted by the salivary glands , contains salivary amylase , an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food ; the saliva also contains mucus , which lubricates the food , and hydrogen carbonate , which provides the ideal conditions of pH ( alkaline ) for amylase to work . After undergoing mastication and starch digestion , the food will be in the form of a small , round slurry mass called a bolus . It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis . Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion . Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin . In infants and toddlers gastric juice also contains rennin .",
  "/wiki/Milkshake": "A milkshake is a sweet , cold beverage that is usually made from milk , ice cream or ice milk , and flavorings or sweeteners such as butterscotch , caramel sauce , chocolate syrup , or fruit syrup . Many more precise and rigid definitions are used , depending on the location . Outside of the United States , a milkshake that uses ice cream or ice milk is sometimes called a thick milkshake or thick shake ; in New England , the term frappe may be used to differentiate it from thinner forms of flavored milk ; in Rhode Island a coffee ice cream ( or coffee syrup ) and milk-based beverage is called a coffee cabinet . Many food places such as McDonald 's avoid the term milkshake on their menus in favor of the term shake . Full-service restaurants , soda fountains , and diners usually prepare and mix the shake by hand from scoops of ice cream and milk in a blender or drink mixer using a stainless steel cup . Many fast food outlets do not make shakes by hand with ice cream ; instead , they make shakes in automatic milkshake machines which freeze and serve a pre-made milkshake mixture consisting of milk , a sweetened flavoring agent , and a thickening agent . However , some fast food outlets still follow the traditional method , and some serve milkshakes which are prepared by blending soft-serve ice cream ( or ice milk ) with flavoring or syrups . Milkshakes can also be made at home with a blender or automatic drink mixer . A milkshake can also be made by adding powder into fresh milk and stirring the powder into the milk . Milkshakes made in this way can come in a variety of flavors , including chocolate , caramel , strawberry , and banana .",
  "/wiki/Milk_skin": "Milk skin or lactoderm refers to a sticky film of protein that forms on top of dairy milk and foods containing dairy milk ( such as hot chocolate and some soups ) . Milk film can be produced both through conventional boiling and by microwaving the liquid , and as such can often be observed when heating milk for use in drinks such as drinking chocolate . It is caused by the denaturation of proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin ( whey protein ) . When milk is boiled , soluble milk proteins are denatured and then coagulate with milk 's fat and form a sticky film across the top of the liquid , which then dries by evaporation . The layer does not need to be discarded and can be consumed , as protein 's nutritional value is unaffected by the denaturation process . Milk film is often considered to be desirable and is used in several recipes for various foods .",
  "/wiki/Protein": "Proteins are large biomolecules , or macromolecules , consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues . Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms , including catalysing metabolic reactions , DNA replication , responding to stimuli , providing structure to cells , and organisms , and transporting molecules from one location to another . Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids , which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes , and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity . A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide . A protein contains at least one long polypeptide . Short polypeptides , containing less than 20-30 residues , are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides , or sometimes oligopeptides . The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues . The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene , which is encoded in the genetic code . In general , the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids ; however , in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and - in certain archaea - pyrrolysine . Shortly after or even during synthesis , the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification , which alters the physical and chemical properties , folding , stability , activity , and ultimately , the function of the proteins . Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached , which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors . Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function , and they often associate to form stable protein complexes .",
  "/wiki/Denaturation_(biochemistry)": "Denaturation is a process in which proteins or nucleic acids lose the quaternary structure , tertiary structure , and secondary structure which is present in their native state , by application of some external stress or compound such as a strong acid or base , a concentrated inorganic salt , an organic solvent ( e.g. , alcohol or chloroform ) , radiation or heat . If proteins in a living cell are denatured , this results in disruption of cell activity and possibly cell death . Protein denaturation is also a consequence of cell death . Denatured proteins can exhibit a wide range of characteristics , from conformational change and loss of solubility to aggregation due to the exposure of hydrophobic groups . Denatured proteins lose their 3D structure and therefore can not function . Protein folding is key to whether a globular or membrane protein can do its job correctly ; it must be folded into the right shape to function . However , hydrogen bonds , which play a big part in folding , are rather weak and thus easily affected by heat , acidity , varying salt concentrations , and other stressors which can denature the protein . This is one reason why homeostasis is physiologically necessary in many life forms . This concept is unrelated to denatured alcohol , which is alcohol that has been mixed with additives to make it unsuitable for human consumption .",

Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas .

In addition , other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt . Some countries require yogurt to contain a certain amount of colony-forming units ( CFU ) of bacteria ; in China , for example , the requirement for the number of lactobacillus bacteria is at least 1 million CFU per milliliter . To produce yogurt , milk is first heated , usually to about 85 \u00b0C ( 185 \u00b0F ) , to denature the milk proteins so that they do not form curds .",

Mozzarella received a Traditional Specialities Guaranteed ( TEG ) certification from the European Union in 1998 . This protection scheme requires that mozzarella sold in the European Union is produced according to a traditional recipe . The TSG certification does not specify the source of the milk , so any type of milk can be used , but it is speculated that it is normally made from whole milk . In Italy , mozzarella made from the milk of the Italian water buffalo is an important variety ; the Italian buffalo mozzarella sold as Mozzarella di Bufala Campana is protected under the EU 's Protected Designation of Origin scheme and may only be produced in select locations in the regions of Campania , Lazio , Apulia and Molise . Fresh mozzarella is generally white but may vary seasonally to slightly yellow depending on the animal 's diet . Due to its high moisture content , it is traditionally served the day after it is made but can be kept in brine for up to a week or longer when sold in vacuum-sealed packages . Low-moisture mozzarella can be kept refrigerated for up to a month , though some shredded low-moisture mozzarella is sold with a shelf life of up to six months . Mozzarella of several kinds is used for most types of pizza and several pasta dishes or served with sliced tomatoes and basil in Caprese salad .",
