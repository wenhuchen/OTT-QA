  "/wiki/Ease_of_Doing_Business_Index": "The ease of doing business index is an index created by Simeon Djankov , an economist at the Central and Eastern Europe sector of the World Bank Group . The academic research for the report was done jointly with professors Oliver Hart and Andrei Shleifer . Higher rankings ( a low numerical value ) indicate better , usually simpler , regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property rights . Empirical research funded by the World Bank to justify their work show that the economic growth impact of improving these regulations is strong . An example of such empirical research is a paper on business regulation and poverty , published in Economics Letters . Empirical research is needed to establish the optimal level of business regulation - for example , what the duration of court procedures should be and what the optimal degree of social protection is . The indicators compiled in the Doing Business project allow such research to take place . Since the start of the project in November 2001 , more than 3,000 academic papers have used one or more indicators constructed in Doing Business and the related background papers by its authors .",

  "/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index": "The Press Freedom Index is an annual ranking of countries compiled and published by Reporters Without Borders based upon the organisation 's own assessment of the countries ' press freedom records in the previous year . It intends to reflect the degree of freedom that journalists , news organisations , and netizens have in each country , and the efforts made by authorities to respect this freedom . Reporters Without Borders is careful to note that the index only deals with press freedom and does not measure the quality of journalism nor does it look at human rights violations in general . The report is partly based on a questionnaire which asks questions about pluralism , [ clarification needed ] media independence , environment and self-censorship , legislative framework , transparency , and infrastructure . The questionnaire takes account of the legal framework for the media ( including penalties for press offences , the existence of a state monopoly for certain kinds of media and how the media are regulated ) and the level of independence of the public media . It also includes violations of the free flow of information on the Internet . Violence against journalists , netizens , and media assistants , including abuses attributable to the state , armed militias , clandestine organisations or pressure groups , are monitored by RSF staff during the year and are also part of the final score . A smaller score on the report corresponds to greater freedom of the press as reported by the organisation . The questionnaire is sent to Reporters Without Borders 's partner organisations : 18 freedom of expression non-governmental organisations located in five continents , its 150 correspondents around the world and journalists , researchers , jurists and human rights activists . Based on the data collected , a score and a position or rank , complementary indicators that together assess the state of media freedom are assigned to each country in the final report . Some countries are excluded from the report because of a lack of reliable or confirmed information . Because the questions and calculations upon which the scores are based have changed over the years , scores are only used to compare countries within a given year .",
