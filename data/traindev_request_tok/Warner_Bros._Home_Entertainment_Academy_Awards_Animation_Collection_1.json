  "/wiki/Fleischer_Studios": "Fleischer Studios ( /\u02c8fla\u026a\u0283\u0259r/ ) was an American corporation which originated as an animation studio located at 1600 Broadway , New York City , New York . It was founded in 1921 as Out of the Inkwell , inc. by brothers Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer who ran the pioneering company from its inception until Paramount Pictures , the studio 's parent company and the distributor of its films , acquired ownership . In its prime , Fleischer Studios was a premier producer of animated cartoons for theaters , with Walt Disney Productions becoming its chief competitor in the 1930s . Fleischer Studios characters included Koko the Clown , Betty Boop , Bimbo , Popeye the Sailor , and Superman . Unlike other studios , whose characters were anthropomorphic animals , the Fleischers ' most successful characters were humans ( with the exception of Bimbo , who was a black-and-white cartoon dog ) . The cartoons of the Fleischer Studio were very different from the Disney product , both in concept and in execution . As a result , the Fleischer cartoons were rough rather than refined , commercial rather than consciously artistic . But in their unique way , their artistry was expressed through a culmination of the arts and sciences . This approach focused on surrealism , dark humor , adult psychological elements , and sexuality , and the environments were grittier and urban , often set in squalid surroundings , reflecting the Great Depression as well as German Expressionism .",

  "/wiki/Popeye": "Popeye the Sailor is a muscular American cartoon fictional character created by Elzie Crisler Segar . The character first appeared in the daily King Features comic strip Thimble Theatre on January 17 , 1929 , and Popeye became the strip 's title in later years . Popeye has also appeared in theatrical and television animated cartoons . Segar 's Thimble Theatre strip was in its 10th year when Popeye made his debut , but the one-eyed sailor quickly became the main focus of the strip , and Thimble Theatre became one of King Features ' most popular properties during the 1930s . After Segar 's death in 1938 , Thimble Theatre was continued by several writers and artists , most notably Segar 's assistant Bud Sagendorf . The strip continues to appear in first-run installments in its Sunday edition , written and drawn by Hy Eisman . The daily strips are reprints of old Sagendorf stories . In 1933 , Max Fleischer adapted the Thimble Theatre characters into a series of Popeye the Sailor theatrical cartoon shorts for Paramount Pictures . These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s , and Fleischer - and later Paramount 's own Famous Studios - continued production through 1957 . These cartoon shorts are now owned by Turner Entertainment and distributed by its sister company Warner Bros. Over the years , Popeye has also appeared in comic books , television cartoons , arcade and video games , hundreds of advertisements , peripheral products ranging from spinach to candy cigarettes , and the 1980 live-action film directed by Robert Altman and starring Robin Williams as Popeye .
