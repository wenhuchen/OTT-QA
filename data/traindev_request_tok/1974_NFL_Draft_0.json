After coming close to their maiden postseason appearance the previous season and finishing with a best-to-date 9-5 record despite an upset loss to the Cardinals , the Falcons traded star cornerback Ken Reaves to obtain in-demand guard Royce Smith in a widely criticized move . During the strike-affected pre-season , they beat the Eagles 23 to 7 in a rain-soaked match , before losing to the Raiders , 28-16 . Soon afterwards the Falcons lost key offensive tackle Bill Sandeman for the entire season with a slipped disc in his back . Along with a form lapse from quarterback Bob Lee and an injury to running back Dave Hampton , this destroyed the Falcons offense . The 1974 Falcons scored 111 points with a mere twelve touchdowns , the lowest total in franchise history , and the second lowest by any team in a fourteen-game NFL season after the infamous Zero Gang offense of the 1977 Buccaneers who were shut out six times in fourteen games . Their failure to score more than seventeen points in any game has been equalled since only by the infamous offense of the 1992 Seahawks . The Falcons sacked long-serving head coach Norman van Brocklin after being thrashed by the Miami Dolphins and having heard demands from fans to make that move .",

On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations .

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

  "/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)": "Safety , historically known as a safetyman , is a position in gridiron football played by a member of the defense . The safeties are defensive backs who line up from ten to fifteen yards from the line of scrimmage . There are two variations of the position in a typical American formation : the free safety ( FS ) and the strong safety ( SS ) . Their duties depend on the defensive scheme . The defensive responsibilities of the safety and cornerback usually involve pass coverage towards the middle and sidelines of the field , respectively . While American ( 11-player ) formations generally use two safeties , Canadian ( 12-player ) formations generally have one safety and two defensive halfbacks , a position not used in the American game . As professional and college football have become more focused on the passing game , safeties have become more involved in covering the eligible pass receivers . Safeties are the last line of defense ; they are expected to be reliable tacklers , and many safeties rank among the hardest hitters in football . Safety positions can also be converted cornerbacks , either by design ( Byron Jones ) or as a cornerback ages ( Charles Woodson , DeAngelo Hall , Lardarius Webb , Tramon Williams ) . Historically , in the era of the one-platoon system , the safety was known as the defensive fullback ( specifically the free safety ; the strong safety would be a defensive halfback , a term still in Canadian parlance ) or goaltender .",

While the club 's sparkling new facility at Arrowhead Stadium was drawing rave reviews , the Chiefs roster was beginning to show its age . The result was the team 's first losing season in 11 years as the club was unable to string together consecutive victories during the year , a first in franchise history . Many of the club 's key players were entering the twilight of their careers : Len Dawson was 39 , Jim Tyrer was 35 , Bobby Bell , Buck Buchanan , and Ed Budde were 34 , Dave Hill was 33 and Otis Taylor was 32 .
