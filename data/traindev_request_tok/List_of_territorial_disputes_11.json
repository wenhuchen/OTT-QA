However , sovereignty of the two Red Sea islands , Tiran and Sanafir , was ceded officially to Saudi Arabia as part of a maritime borders agreement between Egypt and Saudi Arabia . The agreement subsequently was approved by the Egyptian Parliament and finally ratified by the Egyptian President on 24 June 2017 . The island is located at the entrance of the Straits of Tiran , which connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba . It has an area of about 80 square kilometres ( 31 square miles ) . It is part of the Ras Muhammad National Park . The Straits of Tiran is Israel 's only access from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Red Sea , and Egypt 's blockade of the Straits of Tiran on 22 May 1967 was the casus belli for Israel in the Six-Day War . Tiran Island is of strategic significance in the area , as it forms the narrowest section of the Straits of Tiran , which is an important sea passage to the major ports of Aqaba in Jordan and Eilat in Israel . Israel briefly took over Tiran Island during the Suez Crisis and again from 1967 to 1982 following the Six-Day War .

Saudi Arabia also has one of the world 's youngest populations ; 50 percent of its 33.4 million people are under 25 years old . The territory that now constitutes Saudi Arabia was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations . The prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity in the world . The world 's second-largest religion , Islam , emerged in modern-day Saudi Arabia . In the early 7th century , the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabia and created a single Islamic religious polity . Following his death in 632 , his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia , conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory ( from the Iberian Peninsula in the West to modern-day Pakistan in the East ) in a matter of decades . Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun ( 632-661 ) , Umayyad ( 661-750 ) , Abbasid ( 750-1517 ) and Fatimid ( 909-1171 ) caliphates as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia , Africa and Europe .",

Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip ( Palestine ) and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east , Sudan to the south , and Libya to the west . Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan , across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia , and across the Mediterranean lie Greece , Turkey and Cyprus , although none share a land border with Egypt . Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

On 20 June 1947 , the Bengal Legislative Assembly meet to decide the future of the Bengal Presidency , on whether it would be a United Bengal within India or Pakistan ; or be divided into East and West Bengal . At the preliminary joint session , the assembly decided by 120 votes to 90 that it should remain united if it joined the new Constituent Assembly of Pakistan . Later , a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the existing Constituent Assembly of India . In another separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal , it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that the province should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join Pakistan in the event of partition .

The rise of the Russian Empire coincided with the decline of neighboring rival powers : the Swedish Empire , the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , Persia and the Ottoman Empire . It played a major role in 1812-1814 in defeating Napoleon 's ambitions to control Europe and expanded to the west and south . The House of Romanov ruled the Russian Empire from 1721 until 1762 . Its matrilineal branch of patrilineal German descent , the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov , ruled from 1762 to the end of the empire .

Japan 's rapid industrialization and militarization under the slogan Fukoku Ky\u014dhei ( \u5bcc\u570b\u5f37\u5175 , Enrich the Country , Strengthen her Armed Forces ) and Shokusan K\u014dgy\u014d ( \u6b96\u7523\u8208\u696d , Promote Industry ) led to its emergence as a world power and the establishment of a colonial empire following the First Sino-Japanese War , the Boxer Rebellion , the Russo-Japanese War , and World War I . Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s led to the rise of militarism and totalitarianism , eventually culminating in Japan 's membership in the Axis alliance and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific in World War II . Japan 's armed forces initially achieved large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War ( 1937-1945 ) and the Pacific War . However , after many Allied victories and following the Soviet Union 's declaration of war against Japan on August 9 , 1945 , and subsequent invasion of Manchuria and other territories , and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Empire surrendered to the Allies on August 15 , 1945 . A period of occupation by the Allies followed . In 1947 , with American involvement , a new constitution was enacted , officially bringing the Empire of Japan to an end . Occupation and reconstruction continued until 1952 , eventually forming the current constitutional monarchy known as Japan .

Its terms stipulated that Japan cedes to Russia the part of Sakhalin island it then owned in exchange for the group of the Kuril Islands owned by Russia ( between Iturup island and the Kamchatka Peninsula ) . Consequently , Sakhalin island as a whole became Russian territory , and the entire Kuril archipelago Japanese territory . The authentic text of the Treaty is written in French . Differences with its Japanese translation contributed to the controversy on what constitutes the Kuril islands , claims to which Japan renounced in 1951 by the Treaty of San Francisco . The Treaty of Shimoda of 1855 had defined the border between Japan and Russia to be the strait between Iturup ( Etorofu ) and Urup ( Uruppu ) islands in the Kurile chain , but had left the status of Sakhalin ( Karafuto ) open . Without well-defined borders , incidents between Russian and Japanese settlers began to occur . In order to remedy this situation , the Japanese government sent an ambassador , Enomoto Takeaki , to Saint Petersburg to clearly define the border in this area . After a year of negotiations , Japan agreed to renounce its claims to Sakhalin , with compensation for Japanese residents , access by the fishing fleet to the Sea of Okhotsk , ten-years free use of Russian ports in the area and ownership of all of the Kuril Islands .",

[ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty .

  "/wiki/Insular_Government": "The Insular Government of the Philippine Islands was a territorial government of the United States that was established in 1901 and was dissolved in 1935 . The Insular Government was preceded by the United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands and was followed by the Commonwealth of the Philippines . The Philippines were acquired by the United States in 1898 as a result of the Spanish-American War . In 1902 , the United States Congress passed the Philippine Organic Act , which organized the government and served as its basic law . This act provided for a governor-general appointed by the president of the United States , as well as a bicameral Philippine Legislature with the appointed Philippine Commission as the upper house and a fully elected , fully Filipino elected lower house , the Philippine Assembly . The term insular refers to the fact that the government operated under the authority of the U.S. Bureau of Insular Affairs . Puerto Rico and Guam also had insular governments at this time . From 1901 to 1922 , the U.S. Supreme Court wrestled with the constitutional status of these governments in the Insular Cases . In Dorr v. United States ( 1904 ) , the court ruled that Filipinos did not have a constitutional right to trial by jury . In the Philippines itself , the term insular had limited usage . On banknotes , postage stamps , and the coat of arms , the government referred to itself simply as the Philippine Islands . The 1902 Philippine Organic Act was replaced in 1916 by the Jones Law , which ended the Philippine Commission and provided for both houses of the Philippine Legislature to be elected .",

It was formed from the nationalised colonies of the Dutch East India Company , which came under the administration of the Dutch government in 1800 . During the 19th century , the Dutch possessions and hegemony were expanded , reaching their greatest territorial extent in the early 20th century . This colony was one of the most valuable colonies under the Dutch Empire 's rule , and contributed to Dutch global prominence in spice and cash crop trade in the 19th to early 20th century . The colonial social order was based on rigid racial and social structures with a Dutch elite living separate from but linked to their native subjects . The term Indonesia came into use for the geographical location after 1880 . In the early 20th century , local intellectuals began developing the concept of Indonesia as a nation state , and set the stage for an independence movement . Japan 's World War II occupation dismantled much of the Dutch colonial state and economy . Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945 , Indonesian nationalists declared independence which they fought to secure during the subsequent Indonesian National Revolution . The Netherlands formally recognized sovereignty of the United States of Indonesia at the 1949 Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference with the exception of the Netherlands New Guinea ( Western New Guinea ) , whose administration was transferred under authority of Resolution 1752 ( XVII ) to the United Nations 13 years later in 1962 ( also see New York Agreement ) .",

Three other governorates span the Suez Canal , crossing into African Egypt : Suez Governorate on the southern end of the Suez Canal , Ismailia Governorate in the center , and Port Said Governorate in the north . The peninsula acquired the name Sinai in modern times due to the assumption that a mountain near Saint Catherine 's Monastery is the Biblical Mount Sinai .

Relations between Israel and its neighbours were not fully normalised after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War . In 1956 Israel invaded the Sinai peninsula in Egypt , with one of its objectives being the reopening of the Straits of Tiran that Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950 . Israel was eventually forced to withdraw , but was guaranteed that the Straits of Tiran would remain open . A United Nations Emergency Force was deployed along the border , but there was no demilitarisation agreement . In the months prior to June 1967 , tensions became dangerously heightened . Israel reiterated its post-1956 position that the closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping would be a cause for war ( a casus belli ) . In May Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser announced that the straits would be closed to Israeli vessels and then mobilised its Egyptian forces along its border with Israel . On 5 June , Israel launched what it claimed were a series of preemptive airstrikes against Egyptian airfields . The question of which side caused the war is one of a number of controversies relating to the conflict .

The territory of North Borneo was originally established by concessions of the Sultanates of Brunei and Sulu in 1877 and 1878 to a German-born representative of Austria-Hungary , a businessman and diplomat , von Overbeck . Overbeck had recently purchased a small tract of land in the western coast of Borneo in 1876 from American merchant Joseph William Torrey , who had promoted the territory in Hong Kong since 1866 . Overbeck then transferred all his rights to Alfred Dent before withdrawing in 1879 . In 1881 , Dent established the North Borneo Provisional Association Ltd to manage the territory , which was granted a royal charter in the same year . The following year , the Provisional Association was replaced by the North Borneo Chartered Company . The granting of a royal charter worried both the neighbouring Spanish and Dutch authorities ; as a result , the Spanish began to stake their claim of northern Borneo . A protocol known as the Madrid Protocol was signed in 1885 to recognise Spanish presence in the Philippine archipelago , in return establishing the definite border of Spanish influence beyond northern Borneo . To avoid further claims from other European powers , North Borneo was made a British protectorate in 1888 . North Borneo produced timber for export ; along with agriculture this industry remained the main economic resource for the British in Borneo . As the population was too small to effectively serve the economy , the British sponsored various migration schemes for Chinese workers from Hong Kong and China to work in the European plantations , and for Japanese immigrants to participate in the economic activities of North Borneo . The starting of World War II with the arrival of Japanese forces however brought an end to protectorate administration , with the territory placed under a military administration and then designated as a crown colony .",

  "/wiki/Maritime_boundary": "A maritime boundary is a conceptual division of the Earth 's water surface areas using physiographic or geopolitical criteria . As such , it usually bounds areas of exclusive national rights over mineral and biological resources , encompassing maritime features , limits and zones . Generally , a maritime boundary is delineated at a particular distance from a jurisdiction 's coastline . Although in some countries the term maritime boundary represents borders of a maritime nation that are recognized by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , maritime borders usually serve to identify the edge of international waters . Maritime boundaries exist in the context of territorial waters , contiguous zones , and exclusive economic zones ; however , the terminology does not encompass lake or river boundaries , which are considered within the context of land boundaries . Some maritime boundaries have remained indeterminate despite efforts to clarify them . This is explained by an array of factors , some of which involve regional problems . The delineation of maritime boundaries has strategic , economic and environmental implications .",
