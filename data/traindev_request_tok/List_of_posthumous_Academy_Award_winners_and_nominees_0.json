  "/wiki/Academy_Award": "The Academy Awards , more popularly known as the Oscars , are awards for artistic and technical merit in the film industry . Given annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) , the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy 's voting membership . The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette , officially called the Academy Award of Merit , although more commonly referred to by its nickname , the Oscar . The statuette depicts a knight rendered in the Art Deco style . The award was originally sculpted by George Stanley from a design sketch by Cedric Gibbons . AMPAS first presented it in 1929 at a private dinner hosted by Douglas Fairbanks in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in what would become known as the 1st Academy Awards . The Academy Awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in 1930 and was televised for the first time in 1953 . It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now televised live worldwide . It is also the oldest of the four major annual American entertainment awards ; its other three equivalents - the Emmy Awards for television , the Tony Awards for theater , and the Grammy Awards for music - are modeled after the Academy Awards . The 91st Academy Awards ceremony , honoring the best films of 2018 , was held on February 24 , 2019 , at the Dolby Theatre , in Los Angeles , California . The ceremony was broadcast on ABC . A total of 3,096 Oscar statuettes have been awarded from the inception of the award through the 91st ceremony .",

This was the largest age difference between two competing actors in Oscar history until 2013 .

It depicts the origin of Superman ( Reeve ) , including his infancy as Kal-El of Krypton , son of Jor-El ( Brando ) and his youthful years in the rural town of Smallville . Disguised as reporter Clark Kent , he adopts a mild-mannered disposition in Metropolis and develops a romance with Lois Lane ( Kidder ) , while battling the villainous Lex Luthor ( Hackman ) . Several directors , most notably Guy Hamilton , and screenwriters ( Mario Puzo , David and Leslie Newman , and Robert Benton ) , were associated with the project before Richard Donner was hired to direct . Tom Mankiewicz was drafted in to rewrite the script and was given a creative consultant credit . It was decided to film both Superman and its sequel Superman II ( 1980 ) simultaneously , with principal photography beginning in March 1977 and ending in October 1978 . Tensions arose between Donner and the producers , and a decision was made to stop filming the sequel , of which 75 percent had already been completed , and finish the first film . The most expensive film made up to that point , [ citation needed ] with a budget of $ 55 million , Superman was released in December 1978 to critical and financial success ; its worldwide box office earnings of $ 300 million made it the second-highest-grossing release of the year .
