  "/wiki/FM_radio": "FM broadcasting is a method of radio broadcasting using frequency modulation ( FM ) . Invented in 1933 by American engineer Edwin Armstrong , wide-band FM is used worldwide to provide high fidelity sound over broadcast radio . FM broadcasting is capable of higher fidelity - that is , more accurate reproduction of the original program sound - than other broadcasting technologies , such as AM broadcasting or DAB radio . Therefore , FM is used for most broadcasts of music . FM radio stations use the very high frequency range of radio frequencies .",

  "/wiki/Indie_rock": "Indie rock is a genre of rock music that originated in the United States and United Kingdom in the 1970s . Originally used to describe independent record labels , the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock . As grunge and punk revival bands in the US and Britpop bands in the UK broke into the mainstream in the 1990s , it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective . In the 2000s , as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet , some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success , leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term . Sometimes used interchangeably with guitar pop rock , in the mid-1980s , the term indie ( or indie pop ) began to be used to describe the music produced on punk and post-punk labels . Some prominent indie rock record labels were founded during the 1980s . During the 1990s , grunge bands broke into the mainstream , and the term alternative lost its original counter-cultural meaning . The term indie rock became associated with the bands and genres that remained dedicated to their independent status . By the end of the 1990s , indie rock developed several subgenres and related styles , including lo-fi , noise pop , emo , slowcore , post-rock , and math rock . In the 2000s , changes in the music industry and in music technology enabled a new wave of indie rock bands to achieve mainstream success . In the early 2000s , a new group of bands that played a stripped-down , back-to-basics version of guitar rock emerged into the mainstream . The commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by four bands : The Strokes , The White Stripes , The Hives and The Vines .",

  "/wiki/Multilingual": "Multilingualism is the use of more than one language , either by an individual speaker or by a group of speakers . It is believed that multilingual speakers outnumber monolingual speakers in the world 's population . More than half of all Europeans claim to speak at least one language other than their mother tongue ; but many read and write in one language . Always useful to traders , multilingualism is advantageous for people wanting to participate in globalization and cultural openness . Owing to the ease of access to information facilitated by the Internet , individuals ' exposure to multiple languages is becoming increasingly possible . People who speak several languages are also called polyglots . Multilingual speakers have acquired and maintained at least one language during childhood , the so-called first language ( L1 ) . The first language ( sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue ) is acquired without formal education , by mechanisms about which scholars disagree . Children acquiring two languages natively from these early years are called simultaneous bilinguals . It is common for young simultaneous bilinguals to be more proficient in one language than the other . People who know more than one language have been reported to be more adept at language learning compared to monolinguals . Multilingualism in computing can be considered part of a continuum between internationalization and localization .",

  "/wiki/Campus_radio": "Campus radio ( also known as college radio , university radio or student radio ) is a type of radio station that is run by the students of a college , university or other educational institution . Programming may be exclusively by students , or may include programmers from the wider community in which the radio station is based . Sometimes campus radio stations are operated for the purpose of training professional radio personnel , sometimes with the aim of broadcasting educational programming , while other radio stations exist to provide alternative to commercial broadcasting or government broadcasters . Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments , and have very different characteristics from one country to the next . One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness - or , in some countries , even a licensing requirement - to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits . Because of this , campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends , including genres such as punk and new wave , alternative rock , indie rock and hip hop , long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream . Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists . Campus radio supported U2 and REM Many campus radio stations carry a variety of programming including news ( often local ) , sports ( often relating to the campus ) , and spoken word programming as well as general music . Often the radio format is best described as a freeform , with a lot of creativity and individualism among the disc jockeys and show hosts . A number of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet . Although the term campus radio implies full-power AM or FM transmission over the air , many radio stations experiment with low-power broadcasting , closed circuit or carrier current systems , often to on-campus listeners only .

They are generally nonprofit and provide a mechanism for enabling individuals , groups , and communities to tell their own stories , to share experiences and , in a media-rich world , to become creators and contributors of media . In many parts of the world , community radio acts as a vehicle for the community and voluntary sector , civil society , agencies , NGOs and citizens to work in partnership to further community development aims , in addition to broadcasting . There is legally defined community radio ( as a distinct broadcasting sector ) in many countries , such as France , Argentina , South Africa , Australia and Ireland . Much of the legislation has included phrases such as social benefit , social objectives and social gain as part of the definition . Community radio has developed differently in different countries , and the term has somewhat different meanings in the United Kingdom , Ireland , the United States , Canada and Australia , where freedom of speech laws and de facto realities differ .",

In the 1930s , heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands , Kansas City jazz , a hard-swinging , bluesy , improvisational style and Gypsy jazz ( a style that emphasized musette waltzes ) were the prominent styles .

The term top 40 is also used to refer to the actual list of hit songs , and , by extension , to refer to pop music in general . The term has also been modified to describe top 50 ; top 30 ; top 20 ; top 10 ; hot 100 ( each with its number of songs ) and hot hits radio formats , but carrying more or less the same meaning and having the same creative point of origin with Todd Storz as further refined by Gordon McLendon as well as Bill Drake .

  "/wiki/Adult_contemporary": "In North American music , adult contemporary music ( AC ) is a form of radio-played popular music , ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic . AC radio often targets the 25-44 age group , the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s . A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past . This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart .",

Listener contributions are usually screened by a show 's producers in order to maximize audience interest and , in the case of commercial talk radio , to attract advertisers . Generally , the shows are organized into segments , each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however , in public or non-commercial radio , music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments .
