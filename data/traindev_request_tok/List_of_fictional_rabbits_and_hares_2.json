  "/wiki/Tomorrow's_Pioneers": "Tomorrow 's Pioneers ( Arabic : \u0631\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u063a\u062f Ruw\u0101d al-Ghad ; also The Pioneers of Tomorrow ) is a children 's program , broadcast between 2007-09 on the Palestinian Hamas-affiliated television station , Al-Aqsa TV ( Arabic : \u0645\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649 \u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649 ) . The show features young host Saraa Barhoum and her co-host , a large costumed animal as they perform skits ( or scenes ) and discuss life in Palestine in a talk show fashion with call-ins from children ( typically of age 9-13 with some as young as 3 ) . Presented in a children 's educational format similar to such shows as Sesame Street or Barney & Friends , Tomorrow 's Pioneers is highly controversial as it contains antisemitism , Islamism , anti-Americanism , and other anti-Western themes . The show , brought to Western attention by pro-Israel organizations such as Palestinian Media Watch and MEMRI , supposedly deals with Islamic traditions and lifestyles , some as innocuous as the importance of drinking milk , and Muslim customs such as performing one 's daily prayers , but also advocates messages of Islamism such as Resistance Jihad , and the loathing of Israel , the capitalist economic system , the United States , and western world . According to Palestinian Media Watch , two animal character co-hosts , the Mickey Mouse look-alike Farfour and Nahoul the bee were used to champion violence , promote hatred of Israel and preach about world Islamic supremacy . Later in the show 's narrative , the characters were , as the show described it , martyred , with the deaths either directly or implicitly blamed on The Jews , Israel , Israelis , and/or what they believed to be Zionists . The original host of Tomorrow 's Pioneers and Farfour , Hazim Al-Sha'arawi , stated that it was his idea that Farfour be killed by an Israeli interrogator , adding that the show wanted to send a message through this character that would fit the reality of Palestinian life . El-Sharawi states , A child sees his neighbors killed , or blown up on the beach , and how do I explain this to a child that already knows ? The [ Israeli ] occupation is the reason ; it creates the reality . I just organize the information for him . Al-Aqsa 's TV deputy manager stated that the program in fact is simply about Palestinian kids express [ ing ] their feeling [ s ] regarding what they witness -- if it 's [ the ] occupation it 's about that . The show is considered to be the spiritual successor to an earlier Hamas-broadcast children 's radio program series entitled Ovan and Branches ( Arabic : \u0623\u0641\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0623\u063a\u0635\u0627\u0646 ) .",
  "/wiki/Benny_Rabbit": "The Muppets are a group of puppet characters created by Jim Henson , many for the purpose of appearing on the children 's television program Sesame Street . Henson 's involvement in Sesame Street began when he and Joan Ganz Cooney , one of the creators of the show , met in the summer of 1968 , at one of the show 's five three-day curriculum planning seminars in Boston . Author Christopher Finch reported that director Jon Stone , who had worked with Henson previously , felt that if they could not bring him on board , they should make do without puppets . Henson was initially reluctant but agreed to join Sesame Street in support of its social goals . He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the Sesame Street Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the Children 's Television Workshop ( renamed to the Sesame Workshop in 2000 ) , the series ' non-profit producer . The Muppets were a crucial part of the show 's popularity and it brought Henson national attention . The Muppet segments of the show were popular since its premiere , and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons . The Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them , they were predictable , and they appealed to adults and older siblings . During the production of Sesame Street 's first season , producers created five one-hour episodes to test the show 's appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material . Not intended for broadcast , they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969 . The results were generally very positive ; children learned from the shows , their appeal was high , and children 's attention was sustained over the full hour . However , the researchers found that although children 's attention was high during the Muppet segments , their interest wavered during the Street segments , when no Muppets were on screen .",
  "/wiki/Sesame_Street": "Sesame Street is an American educational children 's television series that combines live action , sketch comedy , animation and puppetry . It is produced by Sesame Workshop ( known as the Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW ) until June 2000 ) and was created by Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett . The program is known for its images communicated through the use of Jim Henson 's Muppets , and includes short films , with humor and cultural references . The series premiered on November 10 , 1969 , to positive reviews , some controversy , and high viewership ; it has aired on the U.S. 's national public television provider PBS since its debut , with its first run moving to premium channel HBO on January 16 , 2016 . The format of Sesame Street consists of a combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes in American culture and the audience 's viewing habits . With the creation of Sesame Street , producers and writers of a children 's television show used , for the first time , educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content . It was also the first time a show 's educational effects were formally studied . The show , therefore , has undergone significant changes in its history as adjustments to the format and content have been made to reflect change sources to the curriculum . Shortly after creating Sesame Street , its producers developed what came to be called the CTW model ( after the production company 's previous name ) , a system of television show planning , production , and evaluation based on collaborations between producers , writers , educators , and researchers . The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements , international sales , and other media . By 2006 , there were independently produced versions , or co-productions , of Sesame Street broadcast in twenty countries . In 2001 , there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of Sesame Street , and by the show 's 40th anniversary in 2009 , it was broadcast in more than 140 countries .",

  "/wiki/Captain_Kangaroo": "Captain Kangaroo was an American children 's television series that aired weekday mornings on the American television network CBS from 1955 to 1984 , making it the longest-running nationally broadcast children 's television program of its day . In 1986 , the American Program Service ( now American Public Television , Boston ) integrated some newly produced segments into reruns of past episodes , distributing the newer version of the series on PBS until 1993 . The show was conceived by Bob Keeshan , who also played the title character Captain Kangaroo , and who based the show on the warm relationship between grandparents and children . Keeshan had portrayed the original Clarabell the Clown on The Howdy Doody Show when it aired on NBC . Captain Kangaroo had a loose structure , built around life in the Treasure House where the Captain ( the name kangaroo came from the big pockets in his coat ) would tell stories , meet guests , and indulge in silly stunts with regular characters , both humans and puppets . Keeshan performed as the Captain more than 9,000 times over the nearly 30-year run of the show . The May 17 , 1971 , episode had two major changes on the show : The Treasure House was renovated and renamed The Captain 's Place and the Captain replaced his navy blue coat with a red coat . In September 1981 , CBS shortened the hour-long show to a half-hour , briefly retitled it Wake Up with the Captain , and moved it to an earlier time slot ; it was moved to weekends in September 1982 , and returned to an hour-long format . CBS cancelled Captain Kangaroo at the end of 1984 .",
