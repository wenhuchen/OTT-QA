These Games were the first to be staged in the Southern Hemisphere and Oceania , as well as the first to be held outside Europe and North America . Melbourne is the most southerly city ever to host the Olympics . Due to the Southern Hemisphere 's seasons being different from those in the Northern Hemisphere , the 1956 Games did not take place at the usual time of year , because of the need to hold the events during the warmer weather of the host 's spring/summer ( which corresponds to the Northern Hemisphere 's autumn/winter ) . The Olympic equestrian events could not be held in Melbourne due to Australia 's strict quarantine regulations , so they were held in Stockholm five months earlier . This was the second time that the Olympics were not held entirely in one country , the first being the 1920 Summer Olympics , which were held in Antwerp , Belgium , with some events taking place in Ostend , Belgium and Amsterdam , Netherlands . Despite uncertainties and various complications encountered during the preparations , the 1956 Games went ahead in Melbourne as planned and turned out to be a success . The enduring tradition of national teams parading as one during the closing ceremony was started at these Olympics . Several teams boycotted the Games in protest of the IOC 's rejection to suspend the USSR after their invasion of Hungary . The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals .",

Tokyo had been awarded the organization of the 1940 Summer Olympics , but this honour was subsequently passed to Helsinki because of Japan 's invasion of China , before ultimately being cancelled because of World War II . The 1964 Summer Games were the first Olympics held in Asia , and the first time South Africa was barred from taking part due to its apartheid system in sports . ( South Africa was , however , allowed to compete at the 1964 Summer Paralympics , also held in Tokyo , where it made its Paralympic Games debut . ) Tokyo was chosen as the host city during the 55th IOC Session in West Germany , on 26 May 1959 . These games were also the first to be telecast internationally without the need for tapes to be flown overseas , as they had been for the 1960 Olympics four years earlier . The games were telecast to the United States using Syncom 3 , the first geostationary communication satellite , and from there to Europe using Relay 1 . These were also the first Olympic Games to have color telecasts , albeit partially . Certain events like the sumo wrestling and judo matches , sports huge in Japan , were tried out using Toshiba 's new colour transmission system , but only for the domestic market . History surrounding the 1964 Olympics was chronicled in the 1965 documentary film Tokyo Olympiad , directed by Kon Ichikawa . The games were scheduled for mid-October to avoid the city 's midsummer heat and humidity and the September typhoon season .
