  "/wiki/Christian_denomination": "A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity , identified by traits such as a name , organization , leadership and doctrine . The Roman Catholic Church , Eastern Orthodox Church , and Oriental Orthodoxy , meaning the large majority , all self-describe as churches , whereas many Protestant denominations self-describe as congregations or fellowships . Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine ; issues such as the nature of Jesus , the authority of apostolic succession , ecclesiology , eschatology , and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another . Groups of denominations - often sharing broadly similar beliefs , practices , and historical ties - are sometimes known as branches of Christianity . These branches differ in many ways , especially through differences in practices and belief . Individual denominations vary widely in the degree to which they recognize one another . Several groups claim to be the direct and sole authentic successor of the church founded by Jesus Christ in the 1st century AD . Others , however , believe in denominationalism , where some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels , beliefs , and practices . Because of this concept , some Christian bodies reject the term denomination to describe themselves , to avoid implying equivalency with other churches or denominations . The Roman Catholic Church , which has over 1.3 billion members - slightly over half of all Christians worldwide - does not view itself as a denomination , but as the original pre-denominational church , a view rejected by other Christians . Protestant denominations account for approximately 37 percent of Christians worldwide . Together , Catholicism and Protestantism ( including Anglicanism , and other denominations sharing historical ties ) comprise Western Christianity .",
  "/wiki/Altrincham": "Altrincham ( /\u02c8\u0252ltr\u026a\u014b\u0259m/ ( listen ) OL-tring-\u0259m , locally /\u02c8\u0252ltr\u026a\u014b\u0261\u0259m/ ) is a town in Trafford , Greater Manchester , England , south of the River Mersey 8 miles ( 13 km ) southwest of Manchester city centre , 3 miles ( 5 km ) southwest of Sale and 10 miles ( 16 km ) east of Warrington . At the 2011 Census , it had a population of 52,419 . Historically part of Cheshire , Altrincham was established as a market town in 1290 , a time when the economy of most communities was based on agriculture rather than trade , and there is still a market in the town . Further socioeconomic development came with the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 and the arrival of the railway in 1849 , stimulating industrial activity in the town . Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham 's subsequent growth , along with the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall , formerly the home of the Earl of Stamford , and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I Listed Buildings and a deer park . Altrincham today is an affluent commuter town , partly because of its transport links . The town has a strong middle-class presence ; there has been a steady increase in Altrincham 's middle classes since the 19th century . It is also home to Altrincham F.C . and three ice hockey clubs : Manchester Storm , Altrincham Aces and Trafford Tornados .",
  "/wiki/Methodist": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
  "/wiki/Unitarianism": "Unitarianism ( from Latin unitas unity , oneness , from unus one ) is a Christian theological movement named for its belief that the God in Christianity is one person , as opposed to the Trinity ( tri- from Latin tres three ) which in most other branches of Christianity defines God as one being in three persons : the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . Unitarian Christians , therefore , believe that Jesus was inspired by God in his moral teachings , and he is a savior , but he was not a deity or God incarnate . As is typical of dissenters , Unitarianism does not constitute one single Christian denomination , but rather refers to a collection of both existing and extinct Christian groups , whether historically related to each other or not , which share a common theological concept of the oneness nature of God . While the uncompromising theological monotheism at the heart of Christian Unitarianism distinguishes it from the major Christian denominations which subscribe to Trinitarian theology , Christian Unitarianism is closer to the monotheistic understandings of God in Judaism , as well as the concept of the oneness of God in Islam . More so , Muslims believe that Christian Unitarianism encompasses the one true monotheistic divine message from God , perpetuated through the Abrahamic faiths that predated Islam . Unitarianism is also known for the rejection of several other Western Christian doctrines , including the doctrines of original sin , predestination , and the infallibility of the Bible . Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell , but few do today . Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism , depending on one 's stance or viewpoint , and some exclude it from that term due to its rejection of the Trinity . Despite common origins during the Protestant Reformation , some scholars call it a part of Nontrinitarianism , while others consider it both Protestant and Nontrinitarian , seeing no contradiction between those two terms . None of the three views is universally accepted . The Unitarian movement is tied to the more radical critiques of the Reformation . First organized in Eastern Europe during the Reformation , Unitarian communities have developed in Britain , South Africa , India , Canada , the United States , Jamaica , Nigeria , and Japan .",

The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric , although the monarch is the supreme governor . The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion . It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",

Historically a part of Cheshire , the village is west of Greater Manchester Urban Area , and is the site of a large gas and chemical works , which produce gases by fractional distillation of liquid air . It used to be the site of a Shell Chemicals refinery , which produced polythene and polystyrene . Until recent years there was a Carrington Power Station located on the south bank of the Manchester Ship Canal . The building work commenced in 1947 , although the land for the site was acquired in 1916 . The station opened in 1956 , and was decommissioned during the late 1980s . It was demolished using explosives in 1991 , having stood empty for several years . All that remains today is a large 400 kV switching station . The station had its own railway spur from the Glazebrook to Stockport Tiviot Dale line , evidence of which can still be seen today from the gates where the line crossed Manchester Road . In July 2007 , Bridestones Developments acquired planning permission for a new CCGT ( Combined Cycle Gas Turbine ) power station , to be built on the same site as the old power station .

  "/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses": "Jehovah 's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity . The group reports a worldwide membership of approximately 8.68 million adherents involved in evangelism and an annual Memorial attendance of over 20 million . Jehovah 's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Warwick , New York , United States , which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity . The group emerged from the Bible Student movement founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell , who also co-founded Zion 's Watch Tower Tract Society in 1881 to organize and print the movement 's publications . A leadership dispute after Russell 's death resulted in several groups breaking away , with Joseph Franklin Rutherford retaining control of the Watch Tower Society and its properties . Rutherford made significant organizational and doctrinal changes , including adoption of the name Jehovah 's witnesses [ note 1 ] in 1931 to distinguish them from other Bible Student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of Russell 's traditions . Jehovah 's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching , distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake ! , and for refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider the use of God 's name vital for proper worship . They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines . They do not observe Christmas , Easter , birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity . They prefer to use their own Bible translation , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other Bible translations .",
  "/wiki/Pentecostal": "Pentecostalism or Classical Pentecostalism is a Protestant Christian movement that emphasises direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit . The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost , the Greek name for the Jewish Feast of Weeks . For Christians , this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ , as described in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles . Like other forms of evangelical Protestantism , Pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the Bible and the necessity of accepting Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior . It is distinguished by belief in the baptism in the Holy Spirit that enables a Christian to live a Spirit-filled and empowered life . This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing - two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism . Because of their commitment to biblical authority , spiritual gifts , and the miraculous , Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church . For this reason , some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement . Pentecostalism emerged in the early 20th century among radical adherents of the Holiness movement who were energized by revivalism and expectation for the imminent Second Coming of Christ . Believing that they were living in the end times , they expected God to spiritually renew the Christian Church thereby bringing to pass the restoration of spiritual gifts and the evangelization of the world . In 1900 , Charles Parham , an American evangelist and faith healer , began teaching that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism and along with William J. Seymour , a Wesleyan-Holiness preacher , he taught that this was the third work of grace . The three-year-long Azusa Street Revival , founded and led by Seymour in Los Angeles , California , resulted in the spread of Pentecostalism throughout the United States and the rest of the world as visitors carried the Pentecostal experience back to their home churches or felt called to the mission field ."
