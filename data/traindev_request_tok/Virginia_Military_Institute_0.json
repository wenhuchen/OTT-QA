  "/wiki/Private_(rank)": "A private is a soldier of the lowest military rank ( equivalent to NATO Rank Grades OR-1 to OR-3 depending on the force served in ) . In modern military writing , private is abridged to Pte in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth of Nations countries and to Pvt in the United States .",
  "/wiki/Lieutenant_general": "Lieutenant general , lieutenant-general and similar ( abbrev Lt Gen , LTG and similar ) is a three-star military rank ( NATO code OF-8 ) used in many countries . The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages , where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield , who was normally subordinate to a captain general . In modern armies , lieutenant general normally ranks immediately below general and above major general ; it is equivalent to the navy rank of vice admiral , and in air forces with a separate rank structure , it is equivalent to air marshal . A lieutenant general commands an army corps , made up of typically three army divisions , and consisting of around 60,000-70,000 soldiers ( U.S. ) . The seeming incongruity that a lieutenant general outranks a major general ( whereas a major outranks a lieutenant ) is due to the derivation of the former rank from sergeant major general , which was also subordinate to lieutenant general . In some countries ( e.g . France and Italy ) , the ranks of corps general or lieutenant colonel general are used instead of lieutenant general , in an attempt to solve this apparent anomaly - these ranks are often translated into English as lieutenant general . [ citation needed ] However , some countries of Latin America such as Brazil and Chile use divisional general as the equivalent of lieutenant general . In addition , because no brigadier general rank is used in Japan , lieutenant general is the rank of divisional commander . Therefore , it corresponds to divisional general of these countries . In a number of smaller states which employ NATO and western style military organizational structures , because of the limited number of soldiers in their armies , the rank of lieutenant general is the highest army rank in use . In Latvia , Lithuania and Singapore , the chief of defence is a lieutenant general , and in the Irish Defence Forces and Israel Defense Forces , the Chief of Staff holds this rank .",

  "/wiki/Anglican_Church": "Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition which has developed from the practices , liturgy , and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation . Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans , or Episcopalians in some countries . The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion , which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world , after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church . They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury , and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury , whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares ( Latin , first among equals ) . He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference , chairs the meeting of primates , and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council . Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican , including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment . Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible , traditions of the apostolic Church , apostolic succession ( historic episcopate ) , and the writings of the Church Fathers . Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity , having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement . Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism . These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them , Thomas Cranmer , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions , namely Lutheranism and Calvinism . In the first half of the 17th century , the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition , with theologies , structures , and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way , or via media , between Protestantism and Catholicism - a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as Catholic and Reformed . The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion .",
