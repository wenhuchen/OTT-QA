Known as the Brazilian Paris , due its abundance of green area , it was founded in 1585 and it is also known as the city where the sun rises first , because it is the easternmost city in the Americas at 34\u00b0 47\u2032 38\u2033 W , 7\u00b0 9\u2032 28\u2033 S. Its easternmost point is known as Ponta do Seixas . The city is often referred as the second greenest in the world , with more than 7 square kilometres ( 2.7 sq mi ) of forested land , second only to Paris , France , though such claim seems to be just a publicity stunt from the then mayor during Earth Summit . It is the state 's largest city , with an estimated population of 800,323 of inhabitants ( 2018 ) . Its metropolitan area comprises eight other satellite cities ( Bayeux , Cabedelo , Conde , Lucena , Santa Rita , and others ) , totalling 1,223,000 of inhabitants .

The capital of Para\u00edba received in 2017 the title of creative city by UNESCO , placing Jo\u00e3o Pessoa , as Brazilian city of handicrafts .

The recognition of the capital Jo\u00e3o Pessoa , places it on the Brazilian tourist route for the richness of its popular art . This recognition had great contribution and influence , due to the mermaids project of Penha ; where women artisans perform the manual work , dialoguing with the design , fashion , creative economy , highlighting the art with fish scales in copper wires .",
