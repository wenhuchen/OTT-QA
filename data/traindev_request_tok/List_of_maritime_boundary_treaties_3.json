Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens identify as Turkish , while Kurds are the largest minority at anywhere from 15 to 20 percent of the population . At various points in its history , the region has been inhabited by diverse civilisations including the Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians , and Armenians . Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolises the start and foundation of Turkey . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small principalities called beyliks . Beginning in the late 13th century , the Ottomans started uniting beyliks and conquering the Balkans . After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453 , Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I . During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ottoman Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa and became a world power .",
  "/wiki/Convention_between_Italy_and_Turkey,_1932": "The Convention between Italy and Turkey , signed in Ankara on January 4 , 1932 , by the Italian Plenipotentiary , Ambassador Pompeo Aloisi , and the Turkish foreign minister Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras , settled a dispute that had arisen in the aftermath of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 , about the sovereignty over a number of small islets and the delimitation of the territorial waters between the coast of Anatolia and the island of Kastell\u00f3rizo , which was an Italian possession since 1921 . Through the convention , the islets situated inside the bay of the harbour of Kastellorizo , along with the islands of Rho and Strongili further off , were assigned to Italy , while all other islets in the surrounding area were assigned to Turkey . Moreover , the Italian Government recognised the sovereignty of Turkey over the Aegean islet of Kara Ada ( Greek : Arcos ) , situated in front of the town of Bodrum . In an Appendix signed in December of the same year , the two countries agreed to extend the convention delimiting the sea border between the Anatolian coast and the Italian Dodecanese . This was done by defining thirty five points which were equidistant between Italian and Turkish territory . The validity of the appendix became a political issue in the context of the Aegean dispute in 1996 , after the Imia/Kardak crisis . The Turkish government has rejected it as legally invalid , on the grounds that it was not deposited at the League of Nations in Geneva . This , according to the Turkish view , means that the sovereignty over an unknown number of small islets and rocks in the Dodecanese may be still undefined . However , the validity of the convention itself , with respect to Kara Ada and the Kastell\u00f3rizo region , is not under dispute .",

It took the line that the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) was an illegally constituted puppet state . Though the GDR did hold regular elections , these were neither free nor fair .

  "/wiki/Poland": "Poland ( Polish : Polska [ \u02c8p\u0254lska ] ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Poland ( Polish : Rzeczpospolita Polska [ c ] [ \u0290\u025bt\u0361\u0282p\u0254\u02c8sp\u0254lita \u02c8p\u0254lska ] ( listen ) ) , is a country located in Central Europe . It is divided into 16 administrative subdivisions , covering an area of 312,696 square kilometres ( 120,733 sq mi ) , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate . With a population of nearly 38.5 million people , Poland is the fifth most populous member state of the European Union . Poland 's capital and largest metropolis is Warsaw . Other major cities include Krak\u00f3w , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , Wroc\u0142aw , Pozna\u0144 , Gda\u0144sk , and Szczecin . Poland is bordered by the Baltic Sea , Lithuania , and Russia 's Kaliningrad Oblast to the north , Belarus and Ukraine to the east , Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south , and Germany to the west . The history of human activity on Polish soil spans almost 500,000 years . Throughout the Iron Age the area became extensively diverse , with various cultures and tribes settling on the vast Central European Plain . However , it was the Western Polans who dominated the region and gave Poland its name . The establishment of Polish statehood can be traced to AD 966 , when Mieszko I , ruler of the realm coextensive with the territory of present-day Poland , converted to Christianity . The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . This union formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest ( over 1,000,000 square kilometres - 400,000 square miles ) and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe , with a uniquely liberal political system which adopted Europe 's first written national constitution , the Constitution of 3 May 1791 ."
