It is one of six squares designed by the founder of Adelaide , Colonel William Light , who was Surveyor-General at the time , in his 1837 plan of the City of Adelaide which spanned the River Torrens Valley , comprising the city centre ( South Adelaide ) and North Adelaide . The square was named on 23 May 1837 by the Street Naming Committee after Princess Victoria , then heir presumptive of the British throne , and in 2003 assigned a second name in the language of the original inhabitants , Kaurna , Tarndanyangga ( later changed to Tarntanyangga ) , as part of the dual naming initiative by the Adelaide City Council . The square has been upgraded and modified several times through its lifetime . During the Christmas period , it is traditional for a 24.5-metre ( 80 ft ) high Christmas tree to be erected in the northern part of the square .",
  "/wiki/Adelaide": "Adelaide ( /\u02c8\u00e6d\u0259le\u026ad/ ( listen ) AD-\u0259-layd ) is the capital city of the state of South Australia , and the fifth-most populous city of Australia . The demonym Adelaidean is used to denote the city and the residents of Adelaide . Adelaide is situated on the Adelaide Plains north of the Fleurieu Peninsula , between the Gulf St Vincent in the west and the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east . Its metropolitan area extends 20 km ( 12 mi ) from the coast to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges , and stretches 96 km ( 60 mi ) from Gawler in the north to Sellicks Beach in the south . Named in honour of Queen Adelaide , consort to King William IV , the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for the only freely-settled British province in Australia . Colonel William Light , one of Adelaide 's founding fathers , designed the city centre and chose its location close to the River Torrens , in the area originally inhabited by the Kaurna people and known as Tarndanyangga ( place of the red kangaroo ) . Light 's design , now listed as national heritage , set out the city centre in a grid layout , interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares , and entirely surrounded by parklands . Early colonial Adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers , in contrast to the convict history of other Australian cities . Until the post-war era , it was Australia 's third-largest city . It has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms , and became known as the City of Churches due to its diversity of faiths . Today , Adelaide is noted for its many festivals and sporting events , its food and wine , its coastline and hills , and its large defence and manufacturing sectors . Adelaide 's quality of life has ranked consistently highly in various measures through the 21st century .",

  "/wiki/Ballarat": "Ballarat /\u02c8b\u00e6l\u0259\u02ccr\u00e6t/ is a city located on the Yarrowee River in the Central Highlands of Victoria , Australia . The city has a population of 105,471 . In terms of population Ballarat is the third largest inland city in Australia . Just months after Victoria was granted separation from the state of New South Wales , the Victorian gold rush transformed Ballarat from a small sheep station to a major settlement . Gold was discovered on 18 August 1851 , and news quickly spread of rich alluvial fields where gold could easily be extracted . Unlike many other gold boom towns , the Ballarat fields experienced sustained high gold yields for many decades , which can be evidenced to this day in the city 's rich architecture . The city is famous for the 1854 tax-revolt known as the Eureka Rebellion . In response to this event the first male suffrage in Australia was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of democracy in Australia . The rebellion 's symbol , the Eureka Flag , has become a national symbol and is held at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka in Ballarat . Proclaimed a city in 1871 , its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century , after which its importance relative to both Melbourne and Geelong rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction . It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the 1956 Summer Olympics . It is the commercial capital of the Central Highlands and its largest city , as well as a significant tourist destination .",

As of June 2018 , Bendigo had an urban population of 99,122 , making it the fourth-largest inland city in Australia and fourth-most populous city in the state . It is the administrative centre for the City of Greater Bendigo , which encompasses both the urban area and outlying towns spanning an area around 3,000 km2 ( 1,158 sq mi ) and over 111,000 people . The discovery of gold in the soils of Bendigo during the 1850s made it one of the most significant Victorian-era boomtowns in Australia . News of the finds intensified the Victorian gold rush , bringing an influx of migrants to the city from around the world within a year and transforming it from a sheep station to a major settlement in the newly proclaimed Colony of Victoria . Once the alluvial gold had been mined out , mining companies were formed to exploit the rich underground quartz reef gold . Since 1851 , about 780,000 kilograms ( 25 million troy ounces ) of gold have been extracted from Bendigo 's goldmines , making it the highest producing goldfield in Australia in the 19th century and the largest gold-mining economy in eastern Australia . It is also notable for its Victorian architectural heritage . The city took its name from the Bendigo Creek and its residents from the earliest days of the gold rush have been called Bendigonians . Although the town flourished in its beginnings as a result of the discovery of gold , it experienced a reversal of fortune in the early 20th century . However , its growth accelerated in the postwar years and has continued to increase steadily since .",

[ failed verification ] The Brisbane central business district stands on the historic European settlement and is situated inside a peninsula of the Brisbane River , about 15 kilometres ( 9 miles ) from its mouth at Moreton Bay , a bay of the Coral Sea . The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the hilly floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Taylor and D'Aguilar mountain ranges . It sprawls across several of Australia 's most populous local government areas ( LGAs ) - most centrally the City of Brisbane , which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation . The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite , whilst common nicknames include Brissy , River City and Brisvegas . One of the oldest cities in Australia , Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples . Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located - which in turn takes its name from Sir Thomas Brisbane , the Governor of New South Wales at the time of the city 's founding - the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony . A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe , 28 kilometres ( 17 mi ) north of the central business district , but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825 , opening to free settlement in 1842 . Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859 . During World War II , Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for United States Army General Douglas MacArthur .

Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia , with most of the metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain , a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp . The first areas settled were on the Swan River at Guildford , with the city 's central business district and port ( Fremantle ) both later founded downriver . Captain James Stirling founded Perth in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony . It gained city status ( currently vested in the smaller City of Perth ) in 1856 and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city inherited its name due to the influence of Sir George Murray , then Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Italy , Greece , and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for several large mining operations .

  "/wiki/General_Post_Office,_Sydney": "The General Post Office ( abbreviation GPO , commonly known as the Sydney GPO ) is a heritage-listed landmark building located in Martin Place , Sydney , New South Wales , Australia . The original building was constructed in two stages beginning in 1866 and was designed under the guidance of Colonial Architect James Barnet . Composed primarily of local Sydney sandstone , mined in Pyrmont , the primary load-bearing northern fa\u00e7ade has been described as the finest example of the Victorian Italian Renaissance Style in NSW and stretches 114 metres ( 374 ft ) along Martin Place , making it one of the largest sandstone buildings in Sydney . Throughout its twenty five year construction process , the GPO was marred by two major controversies , the first of which related to the selection of bells for the campanile clock and the second , more significantly , to the commission of Italian immigrant sculptor Tomaso Sani 's realistic depictions of people for the carvings along the Pitt Street arcade . One of its first critics , Frederick Darley ( later , the Chief Justice of NSW ) denigrated the carvings as caricatures and such was the controversy surrounding these works that it led to debates on aesthetics and taste within the New South Wales Legislative Assembly between 1883-1890 in which Barnet was himself called upon to justify and defend his decision . Despite severe criticism and controversy , by the time of its final completion in 1891 , the building was hailed as a turning point for the Colony of New South Wales , and historians have since noted the building 's significance as a force for driving prosperity and for the Federation of Australia . Its architectural expression and in particular its Pitt Street carvings have since been hailed as the beginning of art in Australia , as well as its urban significance in the shaping of Sydney 's urban grid and the Martin Place precinct . The building served as the headquarters of Australia Post from its completion until 1996 when it was privatised and refurbished . The scaled back day-to-day counter postal services are now located on the George Street frontage and the outlet is known as the Sydney GPO Post Shop . The old General Post Office post boxes and Poste restante services are now located in the Australia Post site in the Hunter Connection , on the corner of George Street and Hunter Street . Despite significant internal alterations and additions , the fa\u00e7ade has remained virtually unchanged and is listed both on the Commonwealth Heritage List and the New South Wales State Heritage Register , as recognition of its architectural and social significance to the history of Australia .",
