  "/wiki/Chaco_Culture_National_Historical_Park": "Chaco Culture National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park in the American Southwest hosting a concentration of pueblos . The park is located in northwestern New Mexico , between Albuquerque and Farmington , in a remote canyon cut by the Chaco Wash . Containing the most sweeping collection of ancient ruins north of Mexico , the park preserves one of the most important pre-Columbian cultural and historical areas in the United States . Between AD 900 and 1150 , Chaco Canyon was a major center of culture for the Ancestral Puebloans . [ a ] Chacoans quarried sandstone blocks and hauled timber from great distances , assembling fifteen major complexes that remained the largest buildings ever built in North America until the 19th century . Evidence of archaeoastronomy at Chaco has been proposed , with the Sun Dagger petroglyph at Fajada Butte a popular example . Many Chacoan buildings may have been aligned to capture the solar and lunar cycles , requiring generations of astronomical observations and centuries of skillfully coordinated construction . Climate change is thought to have led to the emigration of Chacoans and the eventual abandonment of the canyon , beginning with a fifty-year drought commencing in 1130 . Comprising a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the arid and sparsely populated Four Corners region , the Chacoan cultural sites are fragile - concerns of erosion caused by tourists have led to the closure of Fajada Butte to the public . The sites are considered sacred ancestral homelands by the Hopi and Pueblo people , who maintain oral accounts of their historical migration from Chaco and their spiritual relationship to the land . Though park preservation efforts can conflict with native religious beliefs , tribal representatives work closely with the National Park Service to share their knowledge and respect the heritage of the Chacoan culture .

Located on an ancient east-west trail in the western part of the state , the monument preserves the remains of a large prehistoric pueblo atop a great sandstone promontory with a pool of water at its base , which subsequently became a landmark where many centuries of explorers and travelers left historic inscriptions that survive today . Between about 1275 to 1350 AD , up to 1,500 people of the Ancestral Puebloan culture lived in the 875-room mesa-top pueblo . The village was situated on the old Zuni-Acoma Trail , an important prehistoric trade route . Spanish explorers visiting the area in the 16th century referred to the notable promontory as El Morro ( The Headland ) ; the local Zuni Indians call it A'ts'ina ( Place of writings on the rock ) , and early Anglo-Americans called it Inscription Rock . With its oasis-like source of water , El Morro served as a stopping place for numerous travelers through the otherwise arid and desolate region , many of whom left signatures , names , dates , and stories of their treks in the walls of the sandstone cliff . While some of the inscriptions are fading , there are still many that can be seen today , with some dating to the 17th century . The oldest historic inscription at El Morro , left by Juan de O\u00f1ate , the first Spanish governor of the colony of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico , is dated April 16 , 1605 . Among the Anglo-American emigrants who left their names there in 1858 were several members of the Rose-Baley Party , including Leonard Rose and John Udell .
