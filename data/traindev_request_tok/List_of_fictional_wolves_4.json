  "/wiki/Balto_(film)": "Balto is a 1995 American-British live-action/animated adventure film directed by Simon Wells , produced by Amblin Entertainment and distributed by Universal Pictures . The film is loosely based on a true story about the dog of the same name who helped save children infected by the diphtheria epidemic in the 1925 serum run to Nome .

Although the film was a financial disappointment ( it was overshadowed by the success of the competing Disney-Pixar film Toy Story ) its subsequent strong sales on home video led to two direct-to-video sequels : Balto II : Wolf Quest ( 2002 ) and Balto III : Wings of Change ( 2004 ) , though none of the voice cast reprised their roles .

Most of his short films consisted of Huck trying to perform jobs in different fields , ranging from policeman to dogcatcher , with results that backfired , yet usually coming out on top , either through slow persistence or sheer luck . Huck did not seem to exist in a specific time period as he has also been a Roman gladiator , a medieval knight , and a rocket scientist . He never appeared in futuristic cartoons , only those set in the present or the past . One regular antagonist in the series was Powerful Pierre , a tall and muscular unshaven character with a French-Canadian accent .

When finally roused to anger , often by a bad guy laughing heartily at him , Droopy is capable of beating adversaries many times his size with a comical thrashing ( You know what ? That makes me mad ! ) . The character first appeared , nameless , in Avery 's 1943 cartoon Dumb-Hounded . Though he was not called Droopy onscreen until his fifth cartoon , Se\u00f1or Droopy ( 1949 ) , the character was already named Droopy in model sheets for his first cartoon . He was officially first labeled Happy Hound , a name used in the character 's appearances in Our Gang Comics . The original Droopy series ended in 1958 as a result of MGM closing its cartoon department , but the character has been revived several times for new productions including films and television shows also featuring MGM 's other famous cartoon stars , Tom and Jerry , either as their ally or enemy . In the cartoon Northwest Hounded Police , Droopy 's last name was given as McPoodle . In The Chump Champ , it was given as Poodle . Nevertheless , Droopy is generally understood to be a basset hound .",

He also shares the Coyote 's appetite and persistent use of Acme Corporation products , but he covets sheep instead of roadrunners and , when he speaks , does not have the upper-class accent or the egotistical bearing of the Coyote . Another crucial difference is that of personality : Ralph does not have the fanatical drive of the Coyote in pursuing his prey , preferring to abandon his chase at the end of the working day . Sam Sheepdog , by contrast , is a large , burly Berger de Brie ( Briard ) with white or tan fur and a mop of red hair that usually covers his eyes . He very rarely runs and tends to be sedentary in his movements . He does , however , possess sufficient strength to incapacitate Ralph with a single punch once he catches him .",

In each episode , the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner , a fast-running ground bird , but is never successful . Instead of his animal instincts , the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions ( sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg ) to try to catch his prey , which backfire comically , with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion . Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme . One running gag running gag involves the Coyote falling from a high cliff . After he goes over the edge , the rest of the scene , shot from a bird's-eye view , shows him falling into a canyon so deep , that his figure is eventually lost to sight . This is followed , a second or two later , by the rising of a dust cloud from the canyon floor as the Coyote hits . Most of the cartoons identify the characters and show a fake Latin species name . The Road Runner is called by such names as Accelerati incredibilus , Velocitus tremenjus , Birdibus zippibus , Speedipus rex and Morselus babyfatious tastius . Species names for Wile E. Coyote include Carnivorous slobbius , Eatius birdius , Overconfidentii vulgaris , Poor schinookiusor Caninus nervousrex .
