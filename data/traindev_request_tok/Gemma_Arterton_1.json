Famous for playing comedic blonde bombshell characters , she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s and was emblematic of the era 's changing attitudes towards sexuality . She was a top-billed actress for only a decade , but her films grossed $ 200 million ( equivalent to $ 2 billion in 2019 ) by the time of her death in 1962 . More than half a century later , she continues to be a major popular culture icon . Monroe was born and raised in Los Angeles . She spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married at age 16 . She was working in a factory as part of the war effort during World War II when she met a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career . The work led to short-lived film contracts with 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures . After a series of minor film roles , she signed a new contract with Fox in late 1950 . Over the next two years , she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies , including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business , and in the dramas Clash by Night and Do n't Bother to Knock . She faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before she became a star , but the story did not damage her career and instead resulted in increased interest in her films . By 1953 , Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars ; she had leading roles in the film noir Niagara , which focused on her sex appeal , and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire , which established her star image as a dumb blonde .",
