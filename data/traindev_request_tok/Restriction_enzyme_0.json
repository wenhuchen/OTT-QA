  "/wiki/EcoRI": "EcoRI ( pronounced eco R one ) is a restriction endonuclease enzyme isolated from species E. coli . The Eco part of the enzyme 's name originates from the species from which it was isolated , while the R represents the particular strain , in this case RY13 . The last part of its name , the I , denotes that it was the first enzyme isolated from this strain . EcoRI is a restriction enzyme that cleaves DNA double helices into fragments at specific sites . It is also a part of the restriction modification system . In molecular biology it is used as a restriction enzyme . EcoRI creates 4 nucleotide sticky ends with 5 ' end overhangs of AATT . The nucleic acid recognition sequence where the enzyme cuts is G/AATTC , which has a palindromic , complementary sequence of CTTAA/G . The / in the sequence indicates which phosphodiester bond the enzyme will break in the DNA molecule . Other restriction enzymes , depending on their cut sites , can also leave 3 ' overhangs or blunt ends with no overhangs .",

Most E. coli strains are harmless , but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts , and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination . The harmless strains are part of the normal microbiota of the gut , and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2 , ( which helps blood to clot ) and preventing colonisation of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria , having a symbiotic relationship . E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter . The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days , but its numbers decline slowly afterwards . E. coli and other facultative anaerobes constitute about 0.1% of gut microbiota , and fecal-oral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease . Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time , which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination . A growing body of research , though , has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for and grow outside a host . The bacterium can be grown and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting , and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years . E. coli is a chemoheterotroph whose chemically defined medium must include a source of carbon and energy . E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism , and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology , where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA . Under favorable conditions , it takes as little as 20 minutes to reproduce .",

  "/wiki/BamHI": "BamH I ( from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ) is a type II restriction endonuclease , having the capacity for recognizing short sequences ( 6 b.p . ) of DNA and specifically cleaving them at a target site . This exhibit focuses on the structure-function relations of BamH I as described by Newman , et al . ( 1995 ) . BamH I binds at the recognition sequence 5'-GGATCC-3 ' , and cleaves these sequences just after the 5'-guanine on each strand . This cleavage results in sticky ends which are 4 b.p . long . In its unbound form , BamH I displays a central b sheet , which resides in between \u03b1-helices . BamH I undergoes a series of unconventional conformational changes upon DNA recognition . This allows the DNA to maintain its normal B-DNA conformation without distorting to facilitate enzyme binding . BamH I is a symmetric dimer . DNA is bound in a large cleft that is formed between dimers ; the enzyme binds in a crossover manner .",

  "/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus": "Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive , round-shaped bacterium that is a member of the Firmicutes , and it is a usual member of the microbiota of the body , frequently found in the upper respiratory tract and on the skin . It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction and is a facultative anaerobe that can grow without the need for oxygen . Although S. aureus usually acts as a commensal of the human microbiota it can also become an opportunistic pathogen , being a common cause of skin infections including abscesses , respiratory infections such as sinusitis , and food poisoning . Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins , and the expression of a cell-surface protein that binds and inactivates antibodies . The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) is a worldwide problem in clinical medicine . Despite much research and development , no vaccine for S. aureus has been approved . An estimated 20% to 30% of the human population are long-term carriers S. aureus which can be found as part of the normal skin flora , in the nostrils , and as a normal inhabitant of the lower reproductive tract of women . S. aureus can cause a range of illnesses , from minor skin infections , such as pimples , impetigo , boils , cellulitis , folliculitis , carbuncles , scalded skin syndrome , and abscesses , to life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia , meningitis , osteomyelitis , endocarditis , toxic shock syndrome , bacteremia , and sepsis . It is still one of the five most common causes of hospital-acquired infections and is often the cause of wound infections following surgery . Each year , around 500,000 patients in hospitals of the United States contract a staphylococcal infection , chiefly by S. aureus . Up to 50,000 deaths each year in the USA are linked with S. aureus infections .",

It can be found in soil , water , and fecal matter . It is grouped with the Morganellaceae and is an opportunistic pathogen of humans . It is known to cause wound infections and other species of its genera are known to cause urinary tract infections . The term Proteus signifies changeability of form , as personified in the Homeric poems in Proteus , the old man of the sea , who tends the sealflocks of Poseidon and has the gift of endless transformation . The first use of the term Proteus in bacteriological nomenclature was made by Hauser ( 1885 ) , who described under this term three types of organisms which he isolated from putrefied meat . One of the three species Hauser identified was Proteus vulgaris , so this organism has a long history in microbiology . Over the past two decades , the genus Proteus , and in particular P. vulgaris , has undergone a number of major taxonomic revisions . In 1982 , P. vulgaris was separated into three biogroups on the basis of indole production . Biogroup one was indole negative and represented a new species , P. penneri , while biogroups two and three remained together as P. vulgaris .",

It was discovered in 1819 by Bartolomeo Bizio in Padua , Italy . S. marcescens is commonly involved in hospital-acquired infections ( HAIs ) , particularly catheter-associated bacteremia , urinary tract infections , and wound infections , and is responsible for 1.4% of HAI cases in the United States . It is commonly found in the respiratory and urinary tracts of hospitalized adults and in the gastrointestinal systems of children . Due to its abundant presence in the environment , and its preference for damp conditions , S. marcescens is commonly found growing in bathrooms ( especially on tile grout , shower corners , toilet water lines , and basins ) , where it manifests as a pink , pink-orange , or orange discoloration and slimy film feeding off phosphorus-containing materials or fatty substances such as soap and shampoo residue . Once established , complete eradication of the organism is often difficult , but can be accomplished by application of a bleach-based disinfectant . Rinsing and drying surfaces after use can also prevent the establishment of the bacterium by removing its food source and making the environment less hospitable . S. marcescens may also be found in environments such as dirt , supposedly sterile places [ citation needed ] , and the subgingival biofilm of teeth . Due to this , and because S. marcescens produces a reddish-orange tripyrrole pigment called prodigiosin , it may cause staining of the teeth . The biochemical pathway for the production of prodigiosin by S. marcescens has been characterized by analyzing what intermediates becomes accumulated in specific mutants .",
