Generation Adidas players do not count against the MLS senior roster and usually earn a much higher salary than the league minimum . Entering into the program automatically classifies a player as professional , and thus disqualifies them from playing college soccer . As a result , Generation Adidas players are also guaranteed scholarships to continue their college education should their professional career not pan out .
