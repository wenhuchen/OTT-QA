The Air Forces were formed from components of the Imperial Russian Air Service in 1917 , and faced their greatest test during World War II . The groups were also involved in the Korean War , and dissolved along with the Soviet Union itself in 1991-92 .

  "/wiki/Royal_Air_Force": "The Royal Air Force ( RAF ) is the United Kingdom 's aerial warfare force . It was formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918 . Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as , at the time , the largest air force in the world . Since its formation , the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history . In particular , it played a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign , the Battle of Britain . The RAF 's mission is to support the objectives of the British Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) , which are to provide the capabilities needed to ensure the security and defence of the United Kingdom and overseas territories , including against terrorism ; to support the Government 's foreign policy objectives particularly in promoting international peace and security . The RAF describes its mission statement as . [ to provide ] an agile , adaptable and capable Air Force that , person for person , is second to none , and that makes a decisive air power contribution in support of the UK Defence Mission . The mission statement is supported by the RAF 's definition of air power , which guides its strategy . Air power is defined as the ability to project power from the air and space to influence the behaviour of people or the course of events . Today the Royal Air Force maintains an operational fleet of various types of aircraft , described by the RAF as being leading-edge in terms of technology . This largely consists of fixed-wing aircraft , including : fighter and strike aircraft , airborne early warning and control aircraft , ISTAR and SIGINT aircraft , aerial refueling aircraft and strategic and tactical transport aircraft .",
  "/wiki/Avro_Shackleton_AEW.2": "The Avro Shackleton is a British long-range maritime patrol aircraft ( MPA ) used by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and the South African Air Force ( SAAF ) . It was developed by Avro from the Avro Lincoln bomber , which itself had been a development of the famous wartime Avro Lancaster bomber . The Shackleton was developed during the late 1940s as part of Britain 's military response to the rapid expansion of the Soviet Navy , in particular its submarine force . Produced as the primary type equipping RAF Coastal Command , the Type 696 , as it was initially designated , incorporated major elements of the Lincoln , as well as the Avro Tudor passenger aircraft , and was furnished with extensive electronics suites in order to perform the anti-submarine warfare ( ASW ) mission along with a much improved crew environment to accommodate the long mission times involved in patrol work . Being known for a short time as the Lincoln ASR.3 , it was decided that the Type 696 would be named Shackleton in service , after the polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton . [ N 1 ] It entered operational service with the RAF in April 1951 . The Shackleton was used primarily in the ASW and MPA roles , but it was also frequently deployed as an aerial search and rescue ( SAR ) platform and for performing several other secondary roles such as mail delivery and as a crude troop-transport aircraft . In addition to its service with the RAF , South Africa also elected to procure the Shackleton to equip the SAAF . In South African service , the type was operated in the maritime patrol capacity between 1957 and 1984 . During March 1971 , a number of SAAF Shackletons were used during the SS Wafra oil spill , intentionally sinking the stricken oil tanker using depth charges to prevent further ecological contamination . During the 1970s , the Shackleton was replaced in the maritime patrol role by the jet-powered Hawker Siddeley Nimrod . During its later life , a small number of the RAF 's existing Shackletons received extensive modifications in order to adapt them to perform the airborne early warning ( AEW ) role .",

It has 290 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 operational aircraft as of June 2019 [ update ] , making it the third-largest air force in the world , after the United States Air Force and the United States Army . The U.S. Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy , which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was effectively disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter . After suffering significant loss of goods and personnel at the hands of the Barbary pirates from Algiers , the U.S. Congress passed the Naval Act of 1794 for the construction of six heavy frigates , the first ships of the U.S. Navy . The U.S. Navy played a major role in the American Civil War by blockading the Confederacy and seizing control of its rivers . It played the central role in the World War II defeat of Imperial Japan . The U.S. Navy emerged from World War II as the most powerful navy in the world . The 21st century U.S. Navy maintains a sizable global presence , deploying in strength in such areas as the Western Pacific , the Mediterranean , and the Indian Ocean .

  "/wiki/Vickers_Wellington": "The Vickers Wellington is a British twin-engined , long-range medium bomber . It was designed during the mid-1930s at Brooklands in Weybridge , Surrey . Led by Vickers-Armstrongs ' chief designer Rex Pierson ; a key feature of the aircraft is its geodetic airframe fuselage structure , which was principally designed by Barnes Wallis . Development had been started in response to Air Ministry Specification B.9/32 , which was issued in the middle of 1932 . This specification called for a twin-engined day bomber capable of delivering higher performance than any previous design . Other aircraft developed to the same specification include the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and the Handley Page Hampden . During the development process , performance requirements such as for the tare weight changed substantially , and the engine used was not the one originally intended . The Wellington was used as a night bomber in the early years of the Second World War , performing as one of the principal bombers used by Bomber Command . During 1943 , it started to be superseded as a bomber by the larger four-engined heavies such as the Avro Lancaster . The Wellington continued to serve throughout the war in other duties , particularly as an anti-submarine aircraft . It holds the distinction of having been the only British bomber that was produced for the duration of the war , and of having been produced in a greater quantity than any other British-built bomber . The Wellington remained as first-line equipment when the war ended , although it had been increasingly relegated to secondary roles ."
