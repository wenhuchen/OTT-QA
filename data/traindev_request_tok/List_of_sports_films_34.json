First released in Japan on 25 March 1943 by Toho film studios , the film was eventually released in the United States on 28 April 1974 . The film is based on the novel of the same name written by Tsuneo Tomita , the son of prominent judoka Tsunejir\u014d Tomita . It follows the story of Sanshiro , a talented though willful youth , who travels to the city in order to learn Jujutsu . However , upon his arrival he discovers a new form of self-defence : Judo . The main character is based on Saig\u014d Shir\u014d . The film is seen as an early example of Kurosawa 's immediate grasp of the film-making process , and includes many of his directorial trademarks , such as the use of wipes , weather patterns as reflections of character moods , and abruptly changing camera speeds . The film itself was quite influential at the time , and has been remade on no fewer than five occasions . It spawned a sequel , Sanshiro Sugata Part II , which was released in 1945 and also directed by Kurosawa .",

The sport was originally created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano ( \u5609\u7d0d\u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce ) as a physical , mental , and moral pedagogy in Japan . Judo 's most prominent feature is its competitive element , where the objective is to either throw or take down an opponent to the ground , immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin , or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke . Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defences are a part of judo , but only in pre-arranged forms ( kata , \u5f62 ) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice ( randori , \u4e71\u53d6\u308a ) . A judo practitioner is called a judoka . The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from kory\u016b ( \u53e4\u6d41 , traditional schools ) . Judo also spawned a number of derivative martial arts across the world , such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu , Krav Maga and Sambo .",

The term gained popularity when newfullcontact.com , then one of the largest websites covering the sport , hosted and republished the article . The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate . During the early 20th century , various interstylistic contests took place throughout Japan and in the countries of the Four Asian Tigers . In Brazil , there was the sport of Vale Tudo , in which fighters from various styles fought with little to no rules . The Gracie family was known to promote Vale Tudo matches as a way to promote their own Brazilian jiu-jitsu style . An early high-profile mixed martial arts bout was fought in 1951 , between the judoka Masahiko Kimura and Brazilian jiu-jitsu founder H\u00e9lio Gracie in Brazil . In the West , the concept of combining elements of multiple martial arts was popularized by Bruce Lee 's Jeet Kune Do during the late 1960s to early 1970s .

American kickboxing originated in the 1970s and was brought to prominence in September 1974 , when the Professional Karate Association ( PKA ) held the first World Championships . Historically , kickboxing can be considered a hybrid martial art formed from the combination of elements of various traditional styles . This approach became increasingly popular since the 1970s , and since the 1990s , kickboxing has contributed to the emergence of mixed martial arts via further hybridization with ground fighting techniques from Brazilian jiu-jitsu and folk wrestling . There is no single international governing body . International governing bodies include the World Association of Kickboxing Organizations , World Kickboxing Association , International Sport Karate Association , International Kickboxing Federation , and World Kickboxing Network , among others . Consequently , there is no single kickboxing world championship , and champion titles are issued by individual promotions , such as Glory , SUPERKOMBAT , ONE FC , K-1 and Kunlun Fight among others . Bouts organized under different governing bodies apply different rules , such as allowing the use of knees or clinching , etc .",

This discipline is known as the art of eight limbs as it is characterized by the combined use of fists , elbows , knees , and shins . Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the late 20th to 21st century , when westernized practitioners from Thailand began competing in kickboxing , mixed rules matches , as well as matches under Muay Thai rules around the world . The professional league is governed by The Professional Boxing Association of Thailand ( P.A.T ) sanctioned by The Sports Authority of Thailand ( SAT ) , and World Professional Muaythai Federation ( WMF ) overseas .
