He was also known as Ji Ry\u014d ( \u81ea\u4e86 ) and by the Chinese-style name Qin Kesheng ( \u6b3d\u53ef\u8056 , J : Kin Kasei ) . Gusukuma was born to an aristocratic family in Shuri . His father was a musician , but Gusukuma was born deaf and he focused his energies in a different direction , teaching himself to paint . He sought out Chinese paintings , and was heavily influenced by them . Hearing of the young painter , King Sh\u014d H\u014d called him to his court , and bestowed upon him the name Ji Ry\u014d . It is said that the Chinese investiture envoys who witnessed his painting compared him to some of the top painters in China , and that Kan\u014d Yasunobu , court painter for the Tokugawa shogunate , similarly praised the artist when one of Gusukuma 's works was brought to Edo by the 1634 Ryukyuan envoy . Most of Gusukuma 's works were destroyed in the 1945 battle of Okinawa . There is only one extant work which bears a Seal ( rakan ) confirming it to have been painted by Gusukuma .

The distinction is not geographic , but relates to the style and contents of the works , and to some extent to the position of the artist . Typically , where professional , formal painters were classified as Northern School , scholar-bureaucrats who had either retired from the professional world or who were never a part of it constituted the Southern School . According to William Watson , while the Northern School contains the painters who favour clear , emphatic structure in their compositions , with the use of explicit perspective devices , the Southern School cultivate a more intimate style of landscape bathed in cloud and mist , in which pleasing calligraphic forms tend to take the place of conventions established for the representation of rocks , trees , etc . The painter of the Southern School was interested in distant effects , but his colleague of the Northern School paid more attention to the devices of composition which achieve the illusion of recession , and at the same time more attentive to close realism of detail . . some artists hover between the two . A more philosophical distinction is that the Southern School painters were thought to have sought the inner realities and expressed their own lofty natures while the Northern painted only the outward appearance of things , the worldly and decorative . Never a formal school of art in the sense of artists training under a single master in a single studio , the Southern School is more of an umbrella term spanning a great breadth across both geography and chronology . The literati lifestyle and attitude , and the associated style of painting , can be said to go back quite far to early periods of Chinese history . However , classification of the Southern School as such , that is , the coining of the term , is said to have been made by the scholar-artist Dong Qichang ( 1555-1636 ) , who borrowed the concept from Ch'an ( Zen ) Buddhism , which also has Northern and Southern Schools .",

While each of these artists was , almost by definition , unique and independent , they all shared an admiration for traditional Chinese culture .

  "/wiki/Shoin": "Shoin ( \u66f8\u9662 , drawing room or study ) is a type of audience hall in Japanese architecture that was developed during the Muromachi period . The term originally meant a study and a place for lectures on the s\u016btra within a temple , but later it came to mean just a drawing room or study . From this room takes its name the shoin-zukuri style . In a shoin-zukuri building , the shoin is the zashiki , a tatami-room dedicated to the reception of guests . The emerging architecture of the Muromachi period was subsequently influenced by the increasing use and appearance of shoin . One of the most noticeable changes in architecture to arise from the shoin came from the practice of lining their floors with tatami mats . Since tatami mats have a standardized size the floor plans for shoin rooms had to be developed around the proportions of the tatami mat ; this in turn affected the proportions of doors , the height of rooms , and other aspects of the structure . Before the shoin popularized the practice of lining floors with tatami mats it had been standard to only bring out a single tatami mat for the highest-ranking person in the room to sit on . The architecture surrounding and influenced by the shoin quickly developed many other distinguishing features . Since the guests sat on the floor instead of on furniture , they were positioned at a lower vantage point than their Chinese counterparts who were accustomed to using furniture . This lower vantage point generated such developments as the suspended ceilings which functioned to make the room feel less expansive , and also resulted in the ceilings rafters being no longer visible as they were in China . The new suspended ceilings also allowed for more elaborate decoration , resulting in many highly ornate suspended ceilings in addition to the much simpler ones .",

Emerging in Tang dynasty China ( 618-907 ) , it , and associated stylistic features , overturned earlier , more realistic techniques . These associated features include a preference for shades of black over variations in colour , and an emphasis on brushwork and the perceived spirit or essence of a subject over direct imitation .

  "/wiki/Bamboo_painting": "Works of bamboo painting , usually in ink , are a recognized motif or subgenre of East Asian painting . In a work of bamboo painting in ink , a skilled artist and calligrapher will paint a bamboo stalk or group of stalks with leaves .

The bamboo painter often inscribes a poem that accompanies the painting and further elucidates the motif . The poem is often an integral part of the work as a whole . A viewer of the work can compare the calligraphy of the poem with the calligraphy of the painting , as both are typically inscribed with the same brush and reflect a similar mood and state of awareness . A standard primer on classical East Asian bamboo painting is Hu Zhengyan 's Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy ( 1633 ) . Because of the volume of bamboo works painted over time , the production of a work of ink bamboo became one of the standard subjects to which an East Asian student could be set in a competitive examination .",
