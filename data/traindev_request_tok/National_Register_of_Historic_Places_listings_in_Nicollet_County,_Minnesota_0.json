  "/wiki/Minnesota_River": "The Minnesota River ( Dakota : Mnis\u00f3ta Wakp\u00e1 ) is a tributary of the Mississippi River , approximately 332 miles ( 534 km ) long , in the U.S. state of Minnesota . It drains a watershed of nearly 17,000 square miles ( 44,000 km2 ) , 14,751 square miles ( 38,200 km2 ) in Minnesota and about 2,000 sq mi ( 5,200 km2 ) in South Dakota and Iowa . It rises in southwestern Minnesota , in Big Stone Lake on the Minnesota-South Dakota border just south of the Laurentian Divide at the Traverse Gap portage . It flows southeast to Mankato , then turns northeast . It joins the Mississippi south of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul , near the historic Fort Snelling . The valley is one of several distinct regions of Minnesota . The name Minnesota comes from the Dakota language phrase , Mnisota Makoce which is translated to land where the waters reflect the sky , as a reference to the many lakes in Minnesota rather than the cloudiness of the actual river . For over a century prior to the organization of the Minnesota Territory in 1849 , the name St. Pierre ( St. Peter ) had been generally applied to the river by French and English explorers and writers . Minnesota River is shown on the 1757 edition of Mitchell Map as Ouadebameni\u017fsout\u00e9 [ Watp\u00e1 Mn\u00edsota ] or R. St. Peter . On June 19 , 1852 , acting upon a request from the Minnesota territorial legislature , the United States Congress decreed the aboriginal name for the river , Minnesota , to be the rivers official name and ordered all agencies of the federal government to use that name when referencing it . The valley that the Minnesota River flows in is up to five miles ( 8 km ) wide and 250 feet ( 80 m ) deep . It was carved into the landscape by the massive glacial River Warren between 11,700 and 9,400 years ago at the end of the last ice age in North America .",

  "/wiki/Classical_Revival_architecture": "Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France . In its purest form , it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity , the Vitruvian principles , and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio . The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture . Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style . In form , neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts . The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament , and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition . Therefore , the style defined by symmetry , simple geometry , and social demands instead of ornament . Neoclassical architecture is still designed today , but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings . In Central and Eastern Europe , the style is usually referred to as Classicism , while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical .",

  "/wiki/Kirkbride_Plan": "The Kirkbride Plan was a system of mental asylum design advocated by Philadelphia psychiatrist Thomas Story Kirkbride ( 1809-1883 ) in the mid-19th century . The asylums built in the Kirkbride design , often referred to as Kirkbride Buildings ( or simply Kirkbrides ) , were constructed during the mid-to-late-19th century in the United States . The structural features of the hospitals as designated by Dr. Kirkbride were contingent on his theories regarding the healing of the mentally ill , in which environment and exposure to natural light and air circulation were crucial . The hospitals built according to the Kirkbride Plan would adopt various architectural styles , but had in common the bat wing style floor plan , housing numerous wings that sprawl outward from the center . The first hospital designed under the Kirkbride Plan was the Trenton State Hospital in Trenton , New Jersey , constructed in 1848 . Throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century , numerous psychiatric hospitals were designed under the Kirkbride Plan across the United States . By the twentieth century , popularity of the design had waned , largely due to the economic pressures of maintaining the immense facilities , as well as contestation of Dr. Kirkbride 's theories amongst the medical community . Numerous Kirkbride structures still exist today , though many have been demolished or partially-demolished and repurposed . At least 25 of the original Kirkbride buildings have been registered with the National Register of Historic Places in the United States , either directly or through their location on hospital campuses or in historic districts .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture": "Gothic Revival ( also referred to as Victorian Gothic , neo-Gothic , or Gothick ) is an architectural movement popular in the Western world that began in the late 1740s in England . Its momentum grew in the early 19th century , when increasingly serious and learned admirers of neo-Gothic styles sought to revive medieval Gothic architecture , in contrast to the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time . Gothic Revival draws features from the original Gothic style , including decorative patterns , finials , lancet windows , hood moulds and label stops . The Gothic Revival movement emerged in 18th-century England , gaining ground in the 19th . Its roots were intertwined with deeply philosophical movements associated with Catholicism and a re-awakening of high church or Anglo-Catholic belief concerned by the growth of religious nonconformism . Ultimately , the Anglo-Catholicism tradition of religious belief and style became known for its intrinsic appeal in the third quarter of the 19th century . Gothic Revival architecture varied considerably in its faithfulness to both the ornamental style and principles of construction of its medieval original , sometimes amounting to little more than pointed window frames and a few touches of Gothic decoration on a building otherwise on a wholly 19th-century plan and using contemporary materials and construction methods . In parallel to the ascendancy of neo-Gothic styles in 19th-century England , interest spread to the rest of Europe , Australia , Sierra Leone , South Africa and to the Americas ; the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the construction of very large numbers of Gothic Revival and Carpenter Gothic structures worldwide . The influence of Revivalism had nevertheless peaked by the 1870s . New architectural movements , sometimes related as in the Arts and Crafts movement , and sometimes in outright opposition , such as Modernism , gained ground , and by the 1930s the architecture of the Victorian era was generally condemned or ignored . The later 20th century saw a revival of interest , manifested in the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Victorian Society in 1958 .",

  "/wiki/Italianate_architecture": "The Italianate style of architecture was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture . In the Italianate style , the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture , which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism , were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics . The style of architecture that was thus created , though also characterised as Neo-Renaissance , was essentially of its own time . The backward look transforms its object , Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles ; every spectator at every period - at every moment , indeed - inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature . The Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash , with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire . This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England , from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras . The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s . Barry 's Italianate style ( occasionally termed Barryesque ) drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance , though sometimes at odds with Nash 's semi-rustic Italianate villas . The style was not confined to England and was employed in varying forms , long after its decline in popularity in Britain , throughout Northern Europe and the British Empire . From the late 1840s to 1890 it achieved huge popularity in the United States , where it was promoted by the architect Alexander Jackson Davis .",

It began on August 17 , 1862 , along the Minnesota River in southwest Minnesota , four years after its admission as a state . Throughout the late 1850s in the lead-up to the war , treaty violations by the United States and late or unfair annuity payments by Indian agents caused increasing hunger and hardship among the Dakota . During the war , the Dakota made extensive attacks on hundreds of settlers and immigrants , which resulted in settler deaths , and caused many to flee the area . Intense desire for immediate revenge ended with soldiers capturing hundreds of Dakota men and interning their families . A military tribunal quickly tried the men , sentencing 303 to death for their crimes . President Lincoln would later commute the sentence of 264 of them . The mass hanging of 38 Dakota men was conducted on December 26 , 1862 , in Mankato , Minnesota ; it was the largest mass execution in United States history . Traders with the Dakota previously had demanded that the government give the annuity payments directly to them ( introducing the possibility of unfair dealing between the agents and the traders to the exclusion of the Dakota ) . In mid-1862 , the Dakota demanded the annuities directly from their agent , Thomas J. Galbraith . The traders refused to provide any more supplies on credit under those conditions , and negotiations reached an impasse . On August 17 , 1862 , one young Dakota with a hunting party of three others killed five settlers while on a hunting expedition .",

  "/wiki/National_Park_Service_rustic": "National Park Service rustic - sometimes colloquially called Parkitecture - is a style of architecture that developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service ( NPS ) through its efforts to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment . Since its founding in 1916 , the NPS sought to design and build visitor facilities without visually interrupting the natural or historic surroundings . The early results were characterized by intensive use of hand labor and a rejection of the regularity and symmetry of the industrial world , reflecting connections with the Arts and Crafts movement and American Picturesque architecture . Architects , landscape architects and engineers combined native wood and stone with convincingly native styles to create visually appealing structures that seemed to fit naturally within the majestic landscapes .

Queen Anne was one of a number of popular architectural styles to emerge during the Victorian era . Within the Victorian era timeline , Queen Anne style followed the Eastlake style and preceded the Richardsonian Romanesque and Shingle styles .

It describes a wide range of picturesque buildings with free Renaissance ( non-Gothic Revival ) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right . Queen Anne , as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less domestic Beaux-Arts architecture , is broadly applied to architecture , furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910 ; some Queen Anne architectural elements , such as the wraparound front porch , continued to be found into the 1920s .",

An early variety of Romanesque Revival style known as Rundbogenstil ( Round-arched style ) was popular in German lands and in the German diaspora beginning in the 1830s . By far the most prominent and influential American architect working in a free Romanesque manner was Henry Hobson Richardson . In the United States , the style derived from examples set by him are termed Richardsonian Romanesque , of which not all are Romanesque Revival . Romanesque Revival is also sometimes referred to as the Norman style or Lombard style , particularly in works published during the 19th century after variations of historic Romanesque that were developed by the Normans and Lombards , respectively . Like its influencing Romanesque style , the Romanesque Revival style was widely used for churches , and occasionally for synagogues such as the New Synagogue of Strasbourg built in 1898 , and the Congregation Emanu-El of New York built in 1929 . The style was quite popular for university campuses in the late 19th and early 20th century , especially in the United States and Canada ; well known examples can be found at the University of California , Los Angeles , University of Southern California , Tulane University , University of Denver , University of Toronto , and Wayne State University .",

It was designed in a restrained Gothic Revival style which captures a transition in Minnesota armory design from heavy , fortresslike buildings to the simpler designs of the 1920s . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 for having local significance in the themes of architecture , military history , and social history . It was nominated for being an excellent example of Minnesota 's pre-World War I armories , as well as for its early status , transitional architecture , and role in St. Peter as a center not only of military affairs but also social and recreational events .",
  "/wiki/Carnegie_library": "A Carnegie library is a library built with money donated by Scottish-American businessman and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie . A total of 2,509 Carnegie libraries were built between 1883 and 1929 , including some belonging to public and university library systems . 1,689 were built in the United States , 660 in the United Kingdom and Ireland , 125 in Canada , and others in Australia , South Africa , New Zealand , Serbia , Belgium , France , the Caribbean , Mauritius , Malaysia , and Fiji . At first , Carnegie libraries were almost exclusively in places where he had a personal connection - namely his birthplace in Scotland and the Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania area , his adopted home-town . Yet , beginning in the middle of 1899 , Carnegie substantially increased funding to libraries outside these areas . In later years few towns that requested a grant and agreed to his terms were refused . By the time the last grant was made in 1919 , there were 3,500 libraries in the United States , nearly half of them built with construction grants paid by Carnegie ."
