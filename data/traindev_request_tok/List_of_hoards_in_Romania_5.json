  "/wiki/Pendant": "The word pendant derives from the Latin word pendere and Old French word pendr , both of which translate to to hang down . It comes in the form of a loose-hanging piece of jewellery , generally attached by a small loop to a necklace , which may be known as a pendant necklace . A pendant earring is an earring with a piece hanging down . In modern French , pendant is the gerund form of pendre ( to hang ) and also means during . The extent to which the design of a pendant can be incorporated into an overall necklace makes it not always accurate to treat them as separate items . In some cases , though , the separation between necklace and pendant is far clearer .",
  "/wiki/Almandine": "Almandine ( /\u02c8\u00e6lm\u0259nd\u026an/ ) , also known as almandite , is a species of mineral belonging to the garnet group . The name is a corruption of alabandicus , which is the name applied by Pliny the Elder to a stone found or worked at Alabanda , a town in Caria in Asia Minor . Almandine is an iron alumina garnet , of deep red color , inclining to purple . It is frequently cut with a convex face , or en cabochon , and is then known as carbuncle . Viewed through the spectroscope in a strong light , it generally shows three characteristic absorption bands . Almandine is one end-member of a mineral solid solution series , with the other end member being the garnet pyrope . The almandine crystal formula is : Fe3Al2 ( SiO4 ) 3 . Magnesium substitutes for the iron with increasingly pyrope-rich composition . Almandine , Fe2+3Al2Si3O12 , is the ferrous iron end member of the class of garnet minerals representing an important group of rock-forming silicates , which are the main constituents of the Earth 's crust , upper mantle and transition zone . Almandine crystallizes in the cubic space group Ia3d , with unit-cell parameter a \u2248 11.512 \u00c5 at 100 K. Almandine is antiferromagnetic with the N\u00e9el temperature of 7.5 K. It contains two equivalent magnetic sublattices .",
