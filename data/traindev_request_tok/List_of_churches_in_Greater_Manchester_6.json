  "/wiki/Christian_denomination": "A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity , identified by traits such as a name , organization , leadership and doctrine . The Roman Catholic Church , Eastern Orthodox Church , and Oriental Orthodoxy , meaning the large majority , all self-describe as churches , whereas many Protestant denominations self-describe as congregations or fellowships . Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine ; issues such as the nature of Jesus , the authority of apostolic succession , ecclesiology , eschatology , and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another . Groups of denominations - often sharing broadly similar beliefs , practices , and historical ties - are sometimes known as branches of Christianity . These branches differ in many ways , especially through differences in practices and belief . Individual denominations vary widely in the degree to which they recognize one another . Several groups claim to be the direct and sole authentic successor of the church founded by Jesus Christ in the 1st century AD . Others , however , believe in denominationalism , where some or all Christian groups are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels , beliefs , and practices . Because of this concept , some Christian bodies reject the term denomination to describe themselves , to avoid implying equivalency with other churches or denominations . The Roman Catholic Church , which has over 1.3 billion members - slightly over half of all Christians worldwide - does not view itself as a denomination , but as the original pre-denominational church , a view rejected by other Christians . Protestant denominations account for approximately 37 percent of Christians worldwide . Together , Catholicism and Protestantism ( including Anglicanism , and other denominations sharing historical ties ) comprise Western Christianity .",

  "/wiki/Roman_Catholic": "The Catholic Church , sometimes referred to as the Roman Catholic Church , is the largest Christian church , with approximately 1.3 billion baptised Catholics worldwide as of 2017 [ update ] . As the world 's oldest and largest continuously functioning international institution , it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilisation . The church is headed by the Bishop of Rome , known as the pope . Its central administration is the Holy See . The Christian beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed . The Catholic Church teaches that it is the One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission , [ note 1 ] that its bishops are the successors of Christ 's apostles , and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ . It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith , reserving infallibility , passed down by sacred tradition . The Latin Church , the twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches , and institutes such as mendicant orders , enclosed monastic orders and third orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the church . Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the principal one , celebrated liturgically in the Mass . The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ . The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven , honoured in dogmas and devotions . Its teaching includes Divine Mercy , sanctification through faith and evangelisation of the Gospel as well as Catholic social teaching , which emphasises voluntary support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy .",

  "/wiki/Church_of_England": "The Church of England ( C of E ) is the established church of England . The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric , although the monarch is the supreme governor . The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion . It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century , and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury . The English church renounced papal authority when Henry VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1534 . The English Reformation accelerated under Edward VI 's regents , before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip . The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach , and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both catholic and reformed :",
  "/wiki/Evangelicalism": "Evangelicalism ( /\u02cci\u02d0v\u00e6n\u02c8d\u0292\u025bl\u026ak\u0259l\u026az\u0259m , \u02cc\u025bv\u00e6n- , -\u0259n/ ) , evangelical Christianity , or evangelical Protestantism , [ note 1 ] is a worldwide , trans-denominational movement within Protestant Christianity which maintains the belief that the essence of the Gospel consists of the doctrine of salvation by grace , solely through faith in Jesus 's atonement . Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or born again experience in receiving salvation , in the authority of the Bible as God 's revelation to humanity , and in spreading the Christian message . The movement has long had a presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th , 20th and early 21st centuries . Its origins are usually traced to 1738 , with various theological streams contributing to its foundation , including English Methodism , the Moravian Church ( in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut ) , and German Lutheran Pietism . Preeminently , John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the First Great Awakening . Today , evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches , as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch . Among leaders and major figures of the evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley , George Whitefield , Jonathan Edwards , Billy Graham , Bill Bright , Harold Ockenga , John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones . The movement gained great momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries with the Great Awakenings in Great Britain and the United States . In 2016 , there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world , meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical . The United States has the largest concentration of evangelicals in the world . American evangelicals are a quarter of the nation 's population and its single largest religious group . The main movements are Baptist churches , Pentecostalism , charismatic Evangelicalism , neo-charismatic Evangelicalism and nondenominational Evangelicalism .",
  "/wiki/Baptist": "Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing believers only ( believer 's baptism , as opposed to infant baptism ) , and doing so by complete immersion ( as opposed to affusion or aspersion ) . Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency ( the responsibility and accountability of every person before God ) , sola fide ( salvation by faith alone ) , sola scriptura ( scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice ) and congregationalist church government . Baptists generally recognize two ordinances : baptism and communion . Diverse from their beginning , those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe , how they worship , their attitudes toward other Christians , and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship . Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam , Dutch Republic with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor . In accordance with his reading of the New Testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . Baptist practice spread to England , where the General Baptists considered Christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law , so that individuals might have freedom of religion . Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English dissenters under King James I . In 1638 , Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies . In the 18th and 19th centuries , the First and Second Great Awakening increased church membership in the United States . Baptist missionaries have spread their faith to every continent .",
  "/wiki/Methodist": "Methodism is an umbrella term used to describe denominations of Protestant Christianity which follow the line of the Methodist movement . Methodist denominations are historically related and derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of John Wesley . George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . [ nb 1 ] Wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . [ nb 2 ] This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinist position . In addition to evangelism , Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals , collectively known as the Social Gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people .",
