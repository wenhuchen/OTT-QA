  "/wiki/Professional_wrestling": "Professional wrestling , often shortened to pro wrestling or simply wrestling , is a form of performance art and entertainment that combines athletics with theatrical performance . It takes the form of events , held by touring companies , that mimic a title-match combat sport . The unique form of sport portrayed is fundamentally based on and evolved from classical and catch wrestling , with modern additions of striking attacks , strength-based holds and throws and acrobatic maneuvers . Much of these derive from the influence of various international martial arts . An additional aspect of combat with improvised weaponry is sometimes included . The matches have predetermined outcomes to heighten entertainment value and all combative maneuvers are executed with the full cooperation of those involved and carefully performed in specific manners intended to lessen the chance of actual injury . These facts were once kept highly secret but are now publicly acknowledged by both performers and promotions . To promote and sustain the willing suspension of disbelief by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude , the performing company avoids discussing the true nature of the performance in official media . Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media ( i.e. , interviews ) often directly acknowledge the dramatic and fixed nature of the spectacle . [ citation needed ]",

  "/wiki/Monday_Night_Wars": "The Monday Night Wars were a period of mainstream televised American professional wrestling where the World Wrestling Federation 's ( WWF , now WWE ) Monday Night Raw and World Championship Wrestling 's ( WCW ) Monday Nitro were broadcast opposite each other in a battle for Nielsen ratings each week . The ratings war lasted from September 4 , 1995 , to March 26 , 2001 . The rating war was part of a larger overall struggle between the two companies , originating in personal animosity between WWF owner Vince McMahon and WCW-owner Ted Turner . The rivalry between the companies steadily escalated throughout the 1990s to include the use of cutthroat tactics and the defections of employees between the two companies . Extreme Championship Wrestling ( ECW ) , while not a party to the rating battle , was also involved as a tertiary player . Throughout the wars , the WWF and WCW would both adopt different concepts and narrative techniques innovated by ECW ; meanwhile , both companies would establish both formal and informal partnerships with the company , with ECW performers either appearing on WWF and WCW shows while still under contract , or outright leaving ECW to work for one of the other two promotions . While WCW was the dominant promotion for much of the mid-1990s , a variety of factors coalesced to turn the tide in the WWF 's favor at the end of the decade , including a radical rebranding of their formerly family-friendly product to highly sexualized and violent shows geared towards older teens and adults . WCW ultimately ran into financial difficulties as a result of the amount of money they had promised wrestlers during a hiring binge in the early and middle part of the decade , which had been aimed at acquiring large portions of the WWF 's talent roster . Despite efforts to salvage the company , it was ultimately sold to Vince McMahon , ending the Monday Night Wars . In retrospect , wrestling commentators have come to see the era of the Monday Night Wars as a golden age of wrestling , with the feud between the two companies bringing out their best quality product both in terms of creativity and the performances of their wrestlers . Notably , as of 2020 , no other company has ever emerged as a viable competitor to WWE since the acquisition of WCW , and WWE itself has never again enjoyed the same level of mainstream success in North America that it did during the Wars ."
