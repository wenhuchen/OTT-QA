Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology , a faculty member in the MIT Media Lab and an associate member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research . In 2018 he was named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator . He is recognized for his work on optogenetics . In this technology , a light-sensitive ion channel such as channelrhodopsin-2 is genetically expressed in neurons , allowing neuronal activity to be controlled by light . There were early efforts to achieve targeted optical control dating back to 2002 that did not involve a directly light-activated ion channel , but it was the method based on directly light-activated channels from microbes , such as channelrhodopsin , emerging in 2005 that turned out to be broadly useful . Optogenetics in this way has been widely adopted by neuroscientists as a research tool , and it is also thought to have potential therapeutic applications . Boyden joined the MIT faculty in 2007 , and continues to develop new optogenetic tools as well as other technologies for the manipulation of brain activity . Previously , Boyden received degrees in electrical engineering , computer science , and physics from MIT . During high school , Boyden attended the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science .",

  "/wiki/Optogenetics": "Optogenetics ( from Greek optik\u00f3s , meaning 'seen , visible ' ) most commonly refers to a biological technique that involves the use of light to control cells in living tissue , typically neurons , that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels . As such , optogenetics is a neuromodulation method that uses a combination of techniques from optics and genetics to control the activities of individual neurons in living tissue - even within freely-moving animals . In some usages , optogenetics also refers to optical monitoring of neuronal activity and control of biochemical pathways in non-neuronal cells , although these research activities preceded the use of light-sensitive ion channels in neurons . As optogenetics is used by some authors to refer to only optical control of the activity of genetically defined neurons and not these additional research approaches , the term optogenetics is an example of polysemy . Neuronal control is achieved using optogenetic actuators like channelrhodopsin , halorhodopsin , and archaerhodopsin , while optical recording of neuronal activities can be made with the help of optogenetic sensors for calcium ( GCaMPs ) , vesicular release ( synapto-pHluorin ) , neurotransmitters ( GluSnFRs ) , or membrane voltage ( Quasars , ASAPs ) . Control ( or recording ) of activity is restricted to genetically defined neurons and performed in a spatiotemporal-specific manner by light . In 2010 , optogenetics was chosen as the Method of the Year across all fields of science and engineering by the interdisciplinary research journal Nature Methods . At the same time , optogenetics was highlighted in the article on Breakthroughs of the Decade in the academic research journal Science .",

In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people . Japan itself is the world 's eleventh most populous country with a population of 126.2 million , of which 97.8% are ethnically Japanese .

[ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) . France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Other major urban areas include Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Lille and Nice . France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people .

  "/wiki/Lithuania": "The first known record of the name of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuva ) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle . The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . [ citation needed ] A likely candidate is Liet\u0101 . Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms , linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation . On the other hand , such naming is not unprecedented in world history . Art\u016bras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis , that Lietuva relates to the word lei\u010diai ( plural of leitis ) .",

  "/wiki/Angiogenesis": "Angiogenesis is the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels , formed in the earlier stage of vasculogenesis . Angiogenesis continues the growth of the vasculature by processes of sprouting and splitting . Vasculogenesis is the embryonic formation of endothelial cells from mesoderm cell precursors , and from neovascularization , although discussions are not always precise ( especially in older texts ) . The first vessels in the developing embryo form through vasculogenesis , after which angiogenesis is responsible for most , if not all , blood vessel growth during development and in disease . Angiogenesis is a normal and vital process in growth and development , as well as in wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue . However , it is also a fundamental step in the transition of tumors from a benign state to a malignant one , leading to the use of angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of cancer . The essential role of angiogenesis in tumor growth was first proposed in 1971 by Judah Folkman , who described tumors as hot and bloody , illustrating that , at least for many tumor types , flush perfusion and even hyperemia are characteristic .",

  "/wiki/Vitamin_A": "Vitamin A is a group of unsaturated nutritional organic compounds that includes retinol , retinal , retinoic acid , and several provitamin A carotenoids ( most notably beta-carotene ) . Vitamin A has multiple functions : it is important for growth and development , for the maintenance of the immune system , and for good vision . Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal , which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin , the light-absorbing molecule necessary for both low-light ( scotopic vision ) and color vision . Vitamin A also functions in a very different role as retinoic acid ( an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol ) , which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells . In foods of animal origin , the major form of vitamin A is an ester , primarily retinyl palmitate , which is converted to retinol ( chemically an alcohol ) in the small intestine . The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin , and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form , retinal . All forms of vitamin A have a beta-ionone ring to which an isoprenoid chain is attached , called a retinyl group . Both structural features are essential for vitamin activity . The orange pigment of carrots ( beta-carotene ) can be represented as two connected retinyl groups , which are used in the body to contribute to vitamin A levels . Alpha-carotene and gamma-carotene also have a single retinyl group , which give them some vitamin activity . None of the other carotenes have vitamin activity . The carotenoid beta-cryptoxanthin possesses an ionone group and has vitamin activity in humans .",
