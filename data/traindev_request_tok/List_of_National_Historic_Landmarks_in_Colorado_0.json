  "/wiki/Santa_Fe_Trail": "The Santa Fe Trail was a 19th-century route through central North America that connected Franklin , Missouri with Santa Fe , New Mexico . Pioneered in 1821 by William Becknell , who departed from the Boonslick region along the Missouri River , the trail served as a vital commercial highway until the introduction of the railroad to Santa Fe in 1880 . Santa Fe was near the end of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro , which carried trade from Mexico City . The route skirted the northern edge and crossed the north-western corner of Comancheria , the territory of the Comanches , who demanded compensation for granting passage to the trail , and represented another market for American traders . Comanche raiding farther south in Mexico isolated New Mexico , making it more dependent on the American trade , and provided the Comanches with a steady supply of horses for sale . By the 1840s , trail traffic along the Arkansas Valley was so heavy that bison herds could not reach important seasonal grazing land , contributing to their collapse , which in turn hastened the decline of Comanche power in the region . The American army used the trail route in 1846 for the invasion of New Mexico during the Mexican-American War . After the U.S. acquisition of the Southwest ending the war , the trail helped open the region to U.S. economic development and settlement , playing a vital role in the expansion of the U.S. into the lands it had acquired . The road route is commemorated today by the National Park Service as the Santa Fe National Historic Trail . A highway route that roughly follows the trail 's path through the entire length of Kansas , the southeast corner of Colorado and northern New Mexico has been designated as the Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway .",

A state of total war emerged , directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries . The major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources . World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history , marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities , most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China . It included massacres , the genocide of the Holocaust , strategic bombing , premeditated death from starvation and disease , and the only use of nuclear weapons in war . Japan , which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific , was at war with China by 1937 , [ b ] though neither side had declared war on the other . World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 , with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan .

Sixty-two percent of the internees were United States citizens . These actions were ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt shortly after Imperial Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor . Of 127,000 Japanese Americans living in the continental United States at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack , 112,000 resided on the West Coast . About 80,000 were Nisei ( literal translation : second generation ; American-born Japanese with U.S. citizenship ) and Sansei ( third generation ; the children of Nisei ) . The rest were Issei ( first generation ) immigrants born in Japan who were ineligible for U.S. citizenship under U.S. law . Japanese Americans were incarcerated based on local population concentrations and regional politics . More than 112,000 Japanese Americans living on the West Coast were forced into interior camps . However , in Hawaii , where 150,000-plus Japanese Americans composed over one-third of the population , only 1,200 to 1,800 were also interned . The internment is considered to have resulted more from racism than from any security risk posed by Japanese Americans .

  "/wiki/Folsom_culture": "The Complex Folsom is a name given by archaeologists to a specific Paleo-Indian archaeological culture that occupied much of central North America . The term was first used in 1927 by Jesse Dade Figgins , director of the Colorado Museum of Natural History . Numerous Paleoindian cultures occupied North America , with some restricted to the Great Plains and Great Lakes of the modern United States of America and Canada as well as adjacent areas to the west and south west . The Folsom Tradition was characterised by use of Folsom points as projectile tips and activities known from kill sites where slaughter and butchering of bison took place and Folsom tools were left behind . Some kill sites exhibit evidence of up to 50 bison being killed , although the Folsom diet apparently included mountain sheep , marmots , deer and cottontail rabbit as well . A Folsom site at Hanson , Wyoming , also revealed areas of hardstanding , which indicate possible dwellings . The type site is Folsom Site , near Folsom , New Mexico , in Colfax County ( 29CX1 ) , a marsh-side kill site found in about 1908 by George McJunkin , a cowboy and former slave who had lived in Texas as a child . Archaeologists excavated the site in 1926 . The Folsom Complex dates to between 9000 BC and 8000 BC and is thought to have derived from the earlier Clovis culture . The Lindenmeier Site in Colorado is a campsite that was used throughout a longer period , spanning this era .",

  "/wiki/Ancestral_Puebloans": "The Ancestral Puebloans were an ancient Native American culture that spanned the present-day Four Corners region of the United States , comprising southeastern Utah , northeastern Arizona , northwestern New Mexico , and southwestern Colorado . The Ancestral Puebloans are believed to have developed , at least in part , from the Oshara Tradition , who developed from the Picosa culture . They lived in a range of structures that included small family pit houses , larger structures to house clans , grand pueblos , and cliff-sited dwellings for defense . The Ancestral Puebloans possessed a complex network that stretched across the Colorado Plateau linking hundreds of communities and population centers . They held a distinct knowledge of celestial sciences that found form in their architecture . The kiva , a congregational space that was used chiefly for ceremonial purposes , was an integral part of this ancient people 's community structure . In contemporary times , the people and their archaeological culture were referred to as Anasazi for historical purposes . The Navajo , who were not their descendants , called them by this term , which meant ancient enemies . Contemporary Puebloans do not want this term to be used . Archaeologists continue to debate when this distinct culture emerged . The current agreement , based on terminology defined by the Pecos Classification , suggests their emergence around the 12th century BC , during the archaeologically designated Early Basketmaker II Era . Beginning with the earliest explorations and excavations , researchers identified Ancestral Puebloans as the forerunners of contemporary Pueblo peoples .",

The massacre , the seminal event of the Colorado Coal Wars , resulted in the deaths of an estimated 21 people ; accounts vary . Ludlow was the deadliest single incident in the southern Colorado Coal Strike , which lasted from September 1913 to December 1914 . The strike was organized by the miners against coal mining companies in Colorado . The three largest companies involved were Colorado Fuel & Iron Company , owned by the powerful Rockefeller family ; Rocky Mountain Fuel Company , and Victor-American Fuel Company . In retaliation for the massacre at Ludlow , the miners armed themselves and attacked dozens of anti-union establishments over the next ten days , destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard along a 40-mile front from Trinidad to Walsenburg .

With more than 5,000 sites , including 600 cliff dwellings , it is the largest archaeological preserve in the United States . Mesa Verde ( Spanish for green table ) is best known for structures such as Cliff Palace , thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in North America . Starting c. 7500 BC Mesa Verde was seasonally inhabited by a group of nomadic Paleo-Indians known as the Foothills Mountain Complex . The variety of projectile points found in the region indicates they were influenced by surrounding areas , including the Great Basin , the San Juan Basin , and the Rio Grande Valley . Later , Archaic people established semi-permanent rock shelters in and around the mesa . By 1000 BC , the Basketmaker culture emerged from the local Archaic population , and by 750 AD the Ancestral Puebloans had developed from the Basketmaker culture . The Mesa Verdeans survived using a combination of hunting , gathering , and subsistence farming of crops such as corn , beans , and squash . They built the mesa 's first pueblos sometime after 650 , and by the end of the 12th century , they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known . By 1285 , following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts , they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico , including Rio Chama , Pajarito Plateau , and Santa Fe .",

Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment , a philosophy he called organic architecture . This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater ( 1935 ) , which has been called the best all-time work of American architecture . As a founder of organic architecture , Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century , influencing three generations of architects worldwide through his works . Wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture , and he also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City , his unique vision for urban planning in the United States . In addition to his houses , Wright designed original and innovative offices , churches , schools , skyscrapers , hotels , museums , and other structures . He often designed interior elements for these buildings , as well , including furniture and stained glass . Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe . Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as the greatest American architect of all time . In 2019 , a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright .

  "/wiki/Mission_66": "Mission 66 was a United States National Park Service ten-year program that was intended to dramatically expand Park Service visitor services by 1966 , in time for the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Park Service . When the National Park Service was created in 1916 , long-distance travel in North America was typically accomplished by train . There was no national road system , and airline travel was in its infancy . Railroads were closely involved in the development of visitor services at such parks as Grand Canyon National Park , Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park , and in many cases the railroads built and operated park visitor facilities . With the development of the US highway system as a public works project during the Great Depression , many previously remote parks became accessible via good roads and inexpensive automobiles . The explosion in prosperity following World War II brought a tide of automobile-borne tourists that the parks were ill-equipped to receive . By the mid-1950s it was apparent that massive investment in park infrastructure was required . Mission 66 was conceived as the means to accommodate increased visitor numbers and to provide high-quality interpretation services . While Mission 66 involved a variety of infrastructure projects such as roads , utilities and employee housing , the most visible components were interpretive facilities and visitor centers . Visitor centers were often the first point of contact between the Park Service and visitors , and the Park Service put considerable emphasis on the appropriate orientation and learning opportunities that visitor centers could provide ."
