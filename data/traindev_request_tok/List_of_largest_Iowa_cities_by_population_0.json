Native Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years . Most were hunter-gatherers , but some , such as the Mound Builders , formed prolific agricultural societies . The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers , then settlers , ventured into the basin in increasing numbers . The river served first as a barrier , forming borders for New Spain , New France , and the early United States , and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link . In the 19th century , during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny , the Mississippi and several western tributaries , most notably the Missouri , formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States . Formed from thick layers of the river 's silt deposits , the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile regions of the United States ; steamboats were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods .",

Although nominally considered a tributary of the Mississippi , the Missouri River above the confluence is much longer and carries a comparable volume of water . When combined with the lower Mississippi River , it forms the world 's fourth longest river system . For over 12,000 years , people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation . More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed , most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous bison herds that roamed through the Great Plains . The first Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century , and the region passed through Spanish and French hands before becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase . The Missouri River was one of the main routes for the westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century . The growth of the fur trade in the early 19th century laid much of the groundwork as trappers explored the region and blazed trails . Pioneers headed west en masse beginning in the 1830s , first by covered wagon , then by the growing numbers of steamboats that entered service on the river . Settlers took over former Native American lands in the watershed , leading to some of the most longstanding and violent wars against indigenous peoples in American history .",

The tribe coalesced in the St. Lawrence River Valley in present-day Ontario , Canada . Under French colonial pressures , it migrated to the southern side of the Great Lakes to territory that much later was organized by European Americans as the states of Michigan , Wisconsin , Illinois , and Iowa . The Meskwaki suffered damaging wars with French and their Native American allies in the early 18th century , with one in 1730 decimating the tribe . Euro-American colonization and settlement proceeded in the United States during the 19th century and forced the Meskwaki/Fox south and west into the tall grass prairie in the American Midwest . In 1851 the Iowa state legislature passed an unusual act to allow the Fox to buy land and stay in the state .

An individual possessing a substantial net worth is known as wealthy . Net worth is defined as the current value of one 's assets less liabilities ( excluding the principal in trust accounts ) . At the most general level , economists may define wealth as anything of value that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept . Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts . Defining wealth can be a normative process with various ethical implications , since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own . A community , region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy .

  "/wiki/Mormon_Trail": "The Mormon Trail is the 1,300-mile ( 2,092 km ) route from Illinois to Utah that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints traveled from 1846 to 1868 . Today , the Mormon Trail is a part of the United States National Trails System , known as the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail . The Mormon Trail extends from Nauvoo , Illinois , which was the principal settlement of the Latter Day Saints from 1839 to 1846 , to Salt Lake City , Utah , which was settled by Brigham Young and his followers beginning in 1847 . From Council Bluffs , Iowa to Fort Bridger in Wyoming , the trail follows much the same route as the Oregon Trail and the California Trail ; these trails are collectively known as the Emigrant Trail . The Mormon pioneer run began in 1846 , when Young and his followers were driven from Nauvoo . After leaving , they aimed to establish a new home for the church in the Great Basin and crossed Iowa . Along their way , some were assigned to establish settlements and to plant and harvest crops for later emigrants . During the winter of 1846-47 , the emigrants wintered in Iowa , other nearby states , and the unorganized territory that later became Nebraska , with the largest group residing in Winter Quarters , Nebraska . In the spring of 1847 , Young led the vanguard company to the Salt Lake Valley , which was then outside the boundaries of the United States and later became Utah . During the first few years , the emigrants were mostly former occupants of Nauvoo who were following Young to Utah . Later , the emigrants increasingly comprised converts from the British Isles and Europe . The trail was used for more than 20 years , until the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 .",
  "/wiki/Emigrant_Trail": "In the American Old West overland trails were popular means of travel used by pioneers and immigrants throughout the 18th century and especially between 1600 and 1870 as an alternative to sea and railroad transport . These immigrants began to settle North America west of the Great Plains as part of the mass overland migrations of the mid-18th century . Settlers emigrating from the eastern United States were spurred by various motives , among them religious persecution and economic incentives . Thus , was born the original 13 colonies of the United States , some of which ( namely North Carolina ) are now considered a part of the midwest . Two major wagon-based transportation networks , one typically starting in Missouri and the other in the Mexican province of Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico , served the majority of migrants during the era of Westward expansion . Three of the Missouri-based routes - the Oregon , Mormon , and California Trails - were collectively known as the Emigrant Trails . Historians have estimated at least 500,000 emigrants used these three trails between 1843 and 1869 , and despite growing competition from transcontinental railroads , some use even continued into the early 20th century . The major southern routes were the Santa Fe Trail , the Southern Emigrant Trail , and the Old Spanish Trail , as well as its wagon road successor the Mormon Road , a southern spur of the California Trail used in the winter that also made use of the western half of the Old Spanish Trail . Regardless of the trail used , the journey was often slow and arduous , fraught with risks from infectious diseases , dehydration , malnutrition , injury , and harsh weather , with as many as one in ten travelers dying along the way , usually as a result of disease . The history of these trails and the pioneers who traveled them have since become deeply embedded in the culture and folklore of the United States as some of the most significant influences to shape the content and character of the nation . The remains of many trail ruts can still be observed in various locations throughout the American West . Travelers may loosely follow various routes of the emigrant trails on modern highways through the use of byway signs across the western states .",

  "/wiki/Wisconsinian_Glaciation": "The Wisconsin Glacial Episode , also called the Wisconsin glaciation , was the most recent glacial period of the North American ice sheet complex . This advance included the Cordilleran Ice Sheet , which nucleated in the northern North American Cordillera ; the Innuitian ice sheet , which extended across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago ; the Greenland ice sheet ; and the massive Laurentide Ice Sheet , which covered the high latitudes of central and eastern North America . This advance was synchronous with global glaciation during the last glacial period , including the North American alpine glacier advance , known as the Pinedale glaciation . The Wisconsin glaciation extended from approximately 75,000 to 11,000 years ago , between the Sangamonian Stage ( known globally as the Eemian stage ) and the current interglacial , the Holocene . The maximum ice extent occurred approximately 25,000-21,000 years ago during the last glacial maximum , also known as the Late Wisconsin in North America . This glaciation radically altered the geography north of the Ohio River . At the height of the Wisconsin Episode glaciation , the ice sheet covered most of Canada , the Upper Midwest , and New England , as well as parts of Idaho , Montana , and Washington . On Kelleys Island in Lake Erie , northern New Jersey and in New York City 's Central Park , the grooves left in rock by these glaciers can be easily observed . In southwestern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta a suture zone between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets formed the Cypress Hills , North America 's northernmost point that remained south of the continental ice sheets . During much of the glaciation , sea level was low enough to permit land animals , including humans , to occupy Beringia ( the Bering Land Bridge ) and move between North America and Siberia . As the glaciers retreated , glacial lakes were breached in great floods of water such as the Kankakee Torrent , which reshaped the landscape south of modern Chicago as far as the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers .",

The information provided by the census informs decisions on where to build and maintain schools , hospitals , transportation infrastructure , and police and fire departments . In addition to the decennial census , the Census Bureau continually conducts dozens of other censuses and surveys , including the American Community Survey , the U.S. Economic Census , and the Current Population Survey .

  "/wiki/American_Revolution": "The American Revolution was a colonial revolt which occurred between 1765 and 1783 . The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War ( 1775-1783 ) with the assistance of France , winning independence from Great Britain and establishing the United States of America . The American colonials proclaimed no taxation without representation starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765 . They rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them because they had no representatives in that governing body . Protests steadily escalated to the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the burning of the Gaspee in Rhode Island in 1772 , followed by the Boston Tea Party in December 1773 . The British responded by closing Boston Harbor and enacting a series of punitive laws which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony 's rights of self-government . The other colonies rallied behind Massachusetts , and a group of American Patriot leaders set up their own government in late 1774 at the Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance of Britain ; other colonists retained their allegiance to the Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories . Tensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when King George 's forces attempted to destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord on April 19 , 1775 . The conflict then developed into war , during which the Patriots ( and later their French allies ) fought the British and Loyalists in the Revolutionary War . Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress which assumed power from the former colonial governments , suppressed Loyalism , and recruited a Continental Army led by General George Washington . The Continental Congress declared King George a tyrant who trampled the colonists ' rights as Englishmen , and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2 , 1776 . The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy , and they proclaimed that all men are created equal .",
