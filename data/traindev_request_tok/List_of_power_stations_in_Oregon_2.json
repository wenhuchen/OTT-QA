  "/wiki/Megawatt": "The watt ( symbol : W ) is a unit of power . In the International System of Units ( SI ) it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second , and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer . In SI base units , the watt is described as k g m 2 s \u2212 3 { \\displaystyle kg\\ , m^ { 2 } s^ { -3 } } , which can be demonstrated to coherent by dimensional analysis . The watt is named after James Watt , an 18th century scottish inventor .",

  "/wiki/Vansycle_Wind_Project": "The Vansycle I Wind Project ( formerly Vansycle Wind Project ) is a wind farm in Umatilla County , Oregon . It consists of 38 Vestas 0.66 MW wind turbines at the upper end of Vansycle Canyon with a collective nameplate generating capacity of 25.08 MW . The project was the first commercial wind energy project constructed and operated in Oregon and began operation in December 1998 . The wind turbines were constructed on leased portions of privately owned farms thereby sparing developers from buying property for the turbines and allowing farmers to generate extra income . Like nearby Stateline Wind Project , Vansycle Wind Project is owned and operated by NextEra Energy Resources formerly known as FPL Energy . The approximate center of the wind farm is located about 17 miles ( 27 km ) west-southwest of Walla Walla , Washington 45\u00b055\u203223\u2033N 118\u00b037\u203248\u2033W / 45.923\u00b0N 118.630\u00b0W / 45.923 ; -118.630Coordinates : 45\u00b055\u203223\u2033N 118\u00b037\u203248\u2033W / 45.923\u00b0N 118.630\u00b0W / 45.923 ; -118.630 .

  "/wiki/Stateline_Wind_Project": "The Stateline Wind Farm is a wind farm located on Vansycle Ridge , which receives 16 to 18 mph ( 26 - 29 km/h ) average wind speeds from the Columbia Gorge , on the border between Washington and Oregon in the United States . With 186 turbines currently operating in both states and 279 more approved for construction , it is the largest wind project in the Northwestern United States and will be the largest in the world . Costing $ 300 million to build , it began operation in 2001 . The project employs 660 kW capacity Vestas wind turbines , which collectively will produce a maximum electrical output of 306.9 MW . ( The current operating capacity is 122.8 MW . ) On average , the project is expected to produce 30 to 35 percent of that capacity year-round . Turbines are controlled individually by electronic systems which direct them into the wind and adjust the pitch of the blades to maximize electrical production at any wind speed from 7 to 56 mph . The turbines automatically shut down at wind speeds excess of 56 mph , a feature which allows them to withstand hurricane-force winds . The wind turbines are grouped in strings of 5 to 37 turbines , each turbine spaced approximately 250 feet ( 76 m ) from the next , generally slightly downwind of the crest of ridges . Each turbine tower is 166 feet ( 50 m ) tall , with blades 76 feet ( 23 m ) wide . Environmental impact studies determined that the site was not used extensively by birds or other species vulnerable to injury from turbines , and the turbine towers ' construction , along with the use of underground power lines , was designed to minimize perching places for birds . The area around the project is used primarily for private farming , including dryland wheat farming and cattle grazing .",
