  "/wiki/Mascot": "A mascot is any person , animal , or object thought to bring luck , or anything used to represent a group with a common public identity , such as a school , professional sports team , society , military unit , or brand name . Mascots are also used as fictional , representative spokespeople for consumer products , such as the rabbit used in advertising and marketing for the General Mills brand of breakfast cereal , Trix . In the world of sports , mascots are also used for merchandising . Team mascots are often related to their respective team nicknames . This is especially true when the team 's nickname is something that is a living animal and/or can be made to have humanlike characteristics . For more abstract nicknames , the team may opt to have an unrelated character serve as the mascot . For example , the athletic teams of the University of Alabama are nicknamed the Crimson Tide , while their mascot is an elephant named Big Al . Team mascots may take the form of a logo , person , live animal , inanimate object , or a costumed character , and often appear at team matches and other related events , sports mascots are often used as marketing tools for their teams to children . Since the mid-20th century , costumed characters have provided teams with an opportunity to choose a fantasy creature as their mascot , as is the case with the Philadelphia Phillies ' mascot , the Phillie Phanatic , and the Philadelphia Flyers ' mascot , Gritty . Costumed mascots are commonplace , and are regularly used as goodwill ambassadors in the community for their team , company , or organization such as the U.S. Forest Service 's Smokey Bear .",
