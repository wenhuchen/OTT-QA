The Canarsie Line was first a steam railroad , then a Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company ( BRT ) , later Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation ( BMT ) , elevated line . It was extended into Manhattan via subway in 1924-1928 . Since the early 2000s , the line 's signal system has been converted to an automated system .

The first section of the line opened in 1936 from West Fourth Street to East Broadway with service provided by Eighth Avenue Line trains . This section was initially referred to as the Houston-Essex Street Route . The Sixth Avenue subway was completed in 1940 , providing service north of West Fourth Street , connecting to the Queens Boulevard Line and the Eighth Avenue Line . Initially , the Sixth Avenue Line carried only local service , since there were no express tracks between 34th Street and West 4th Street .

  "/wiki/IRT_Broadway\u2013Seventh_Avenue_Line": "The IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line ( also known as the IRT Seventh Avenue Line or the IRT West Side Line ) is a New York City Subway line . It is one of several lines that serves the A Division , stretching from South Ferry in Lower Manhattan north to Van Cortlandt Park-242nd Street in Riverdale , Bronx . The Brooklyn Branch , known as the Wall and William Streets Branch during construction , from the main line at Chambers Street southeast through the Clark Street Tunnel to Borough Hall in Downtown Brooklyn , is also part of the Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line . The line was constructed in two main portions by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company ( IRT ) , a private operator . The first portion , north of 42nd Street , was opened between 1904 and 1908 , and is part of the first subway line in the city . The line ran from City Hall , up the Lexington Avenue Line , across 42nd Street , and up Seventh Avenue and Broadway , before splitting into the Broadway Branch and the Lenox Avenue Line . The second portion of the line , that south of 42nd Street , was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts , which were signed between the IRT , the New York Municipal Railway ( a subsidiary of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company ) , and the City of New York . Among the various subway lines that were to be constructed as part of the contracts , the West Side Line was to be extended south along Seventh Avenue to serve Manhattan 's West Side . This extension extended service to the end of Lower Manhattan and into Brooklyn , relieving crowding on the East Side Line , while opening up service to new areas . The Pennsylvania Railroad 's new hub in Manhattan , Penn Station , could now be accessed by the subway . Additionally , Manhattan 's West Side was rebuilt with the arrival of the line . To allow the wide four-track line to go through the area , new streets had to be mapped and built , and new buildings were constructed as a result .",

The second portion of the line , north of 42nd Street , was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts , which were signed between the IRT ; the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company , via a subsidiary ; and the City of New York . For decades , the Lexington Avenue Line was the only line in Manhattan that directly served the Upper East Side and East Midtown ; this four-track line is the most used rapid transit line in the United States . Its average of 1.3 million daily riders is more than the total riderships of the transit systems of San Francisco ( 452,600 weekday passengers ) , Chicago ( 772,900 weekday passengers ) , and Boston ( 569,200 ) . In 2007 , its ridership also exceeded that of the entire Washington Metro , and in part spurred the construction of the parallel Second Avenue Subway that year , to relieve congestion on the Lexington Avenue line . Four stations along this line have been abandoned . When platforms were lengthened to fit ten cars , it was deemed most beneficial to close these stations and open new entrances for adjacent stations . The 18th Street station was abandoned because of the proximity to both 14th Street-Union Square and 23rd Street .",
