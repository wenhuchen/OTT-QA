He was a mathematics prodigy , but he abandoned an academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle . Between 1978 and 1995 , he killed three people and injured 23 others in an attempt to start a revolution by conducting a nationwide bombing campaign targeting people involved with modern technology . In 1971 , Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near Lincoln , Montana , where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient . He witnessed the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin and concluded that living in nature was untenable ; he began his bombing campaign in 1978 . In 1995 , he sent a letter to The New York Times and promised to desist from terrorism if The Times or The Washington Post published his essay Industrial Society and Its Future , in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies that require large-scale organization . Kaczynski was the subject of the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) . Before his identity was known , the FBI used the acronym UNABOM ( University and Airline Bomber ) to refer to his case , which resulted in the media naming him the Unabomber . The FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno pushed for the publication of Industrial Society and Its Future , which led to a tip from Kaczynski 's brother David , who recognized the writing style . After his arrest in 1996 , Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted him to plead insanity in order to avoid the death penalty , as he did not believe that he was insane . In 1998 , a plea bargain was reached under which he pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole .",

  "/wiki/Disney+": "Disney+ ( pronounced Disney Plus ) is an American subscription video on-demand streaming service owned and operated by the Direct-to-Consumer & International ( DTCI ) division of The Walt Disney Company . The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by The Walt Disney Studios and Walt Disney Television , with the service advertising content from Disney 's Marvel , National Geographic , Pixar , and Star Wars brands in particular . Original films and television series are also distributed on Disney+ , with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform as of November 2019 [ update ] . Serving adjacent to Disney 's other streaming platforms - the general programming-oriented Hulu and the sports-oriented ESPN+ - Disney+ focuses on family-oriented entertainment , and features no R-rated or TV-MA-rated programming . Disney+ relies on technology developed by Disney Streaming Services , originally established as BAMTech in 2015 , when it was spun off from MLB Advanced Media ( MLBAM ) . Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017 , and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney 's acquisition of 21st Century Fox . With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018 , and Disney 's streaming distribution deal with Netflix ending in 2019 , Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content . Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017 ; Marvel 's original series for Netflix were cancelled in favor of Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+ . Disney+ debuted on November 12 , 2019 , in the United States , Canada , and the Netherlands . The service was expanded to Australia , New Zealand , and Puerto Rico a week later , and will be expanded to select European countries and India in March 2020 . Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in late 2020 through 2021 , as Disney 's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire . Upon launch , the service was met with positive reception of its content library , but was criticized for technical problems ."
