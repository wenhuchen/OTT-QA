The party promotes green politics , specifically environmentalism ; nonviolence ; social justice ; participatory , grassroots democracy ; gender equality ; LGBT rights ; anti-war and anti-racism . On the political spectrum , the party is generally seen as left-wing . The GPUS was founded in 2001 as the Association of State Green Parties ( ASGP ) split from the Greens/Green Party USA ( G/GPUSA ) . After its founding , the GPUS soon became the primary national green organization in the country , eclipsing the G/GPUSA , which was formed in 1991 out of the Green Committees of Correspondence ( CoC ) , a collection of local green groups active since 1984 . The ASGP , which formed in 1996 , had increasingly distanced itself from the G/GPUSA in the late 1990s . The Greens gained widespread public attention during the 2000 presidential election , when the ticket composed of Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke won 2.7% of the popular vote . Nader was vilified by many Democrats , who accused him of spoiling the election for Al Gore , the Democratic candidate . Nader maintains that he was not a spoiler in the 2000 election .",
