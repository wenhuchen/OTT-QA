China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais .

The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior . The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba .

The city was settled in 10th century by Kingdom of Janggala , one of the two Javanese kingdoms that was formed in 1045 when Airlangga abdicated his throne in favour of his two sons . In the late 15th and 16th centuries , Surabaya grew to be a duchy , a major political and military power as well as a port in eastern Java , probably under Majapahit empire . At that time , Surabaya was already a major trading port , owing to its location on the River Brantas delta and on the trade route between Malacca and the Spice Islands via the Java Sea . During the decline of Majapahit , the lord of Surabaya resisted the rise of the Demak Sultanate , and only submitted to its rule in 1530 . Surabaya became independent after the death of Sultan Trenggana of Demak in 1546 .
