The Goa Inquisition was proposed by Francis Xavier . He also was the first Christian missionary to venture into Japan , Borneo , the Maluku Islands , and other areas . In those areas , struggling to learn the local languages and in the face of opposition , he had less success than he had enjoyed in India .

He is best known for the account of his using his military sword to cut his cloak in two , to give half to a beggar clad only in rags in the depth of winter . His shrine in Tours became a famous stopping-point for pilgrims on the road to Santiago de Compostela in Spain . His cult was revived in French nationalism during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/1 , and as a consequence he was seen as a patron saint of France during the French Third Republic .",

  "/wiki/Gothic_architecture": "Gothic architecture ( Latin : francigenum opus ) is a style that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages . It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture . Originating in 12th-century France , it was widely used , especially for cathedrals and churches , until the 16th century . Its most prominent features included the use of the rib vault and the flying buttress , which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building , giving greater height and more space for windows . Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass and the rose window , to bring light and color to the interior . Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior , particularly over the portals , to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners . Some key architectural features , such as the pointed arch and a decorative kind of rib vault , existed earlier outside Europe , and may have been derived from Islamic architecture . These features had both existed in Romanesque architecture , but they were used more extensively and in more innovative ways to make Gothic cathedrals higher , stronger , and filled with light . The first important example is generally considered to be the Basilica of Saint-Denis , near Paris , whose choir was reconstructed with Gothic rib vaults and large stained glass windows between 1140 and 1144 .",

  "/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary": "The Assumption of Mary into Heaven ( often shortened to the Assumption ) is , according to the beliefs of the Catholic Church , Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy , the bodily taking up of the Virgin Mary into Heaven at the end of her earthly life . In the churches that observe it , the Assumption is a major feast day , commonly celebrated on 15 August . In many countries , the feast is also marked as a Holy Day of Obligation in the Roman Catholic Church . The Catholic Church teaches as dogma that the Virgin Mary having completed the course of her earthly life , was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory . This doctrine was dogmatically defined by Pope Pius XII on 1 November 1950 , in the apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus by exercising papal infallibility . While the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church believe in the Dormition of the Mother of God ( Dormition of the Theotokos or the Falling Asleep of the Mother of God ) , whether Mary had a physical death has not been dogmatically defined . In Munificentissimus Deus ( item 39 ) Pope Pius XII pointed to the Book of Genesis ( 3:15 ) as scriptural support for the dogma in terms of Mary 's victory over sin and death through her intimate association with the new Adam ( Christ ) as also reflected in 1 Corinthians 15:54 : then shall come to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory . The New Testament contains no explicit narrative about the death or Dormition , nor of the Assumption of Mary , but several scriptural passages have been theologically interpreted to describe the ultimate fate in this and the afterworld of the Mother of Jesus ( see below ) .

He is called a prophet by all of these faiths , and is honored as a saint in many Christian traditions . According to the New Testament , John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself , and the Gospels portray John as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus , since John announces Jesus ' coming and prepares the people for Jesus ' ministry . Jesus himself identifies John as Elijah who is to come , which some biblical scholars interpret to mean that Jesus believed that John was the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet Elijah , although John the Baptist in the Gospel of John explicitly denies being linked to Elijah ( John 1:21 ) . According to the New Testament , John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth were relatives . Some scholars maintain that John belonged to the Essenes , a semi-ascetic Judaic sect who expected a Hebrew messiah and who practiced ritual baptism . John used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his pre-messianic movement . Most scholars agree that John baptized Jesus , and several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus ' early followers had previously been followers of John .

Trinitarianism contrasts with positions such as Binitarianism ( one deity in two persons ) and Monarchianism ( no plurality of persons within God ) , of which Modalistic Monarchianism ( one deity revealed in three modes ) and Unitarianism ( one deity in one person ) are subsets . While the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament , the New Testament possesses a triadic understanding of God and contains a number of Trinitarian formulas . The doctrine of the Trinity was first formulated among the fathers of the Church as early Christians attempted to rationalize the relationship between Jesus and God in their scriptural documents and prior traditions .",
