Verne is generally considered a major literary author in France and most of Europe , where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism . His reputation was markedly different in Anglophone regions where he had often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or children 's books , largely because of the highly abridged and altered translations in which his novels have often been printed ( until the 1980s , when his literary reputation . began to improve ) .

  "/wiki/BBC_Television_Shakespeare": "The BBC Television Shakespeare is a series of British television adaptations of the plays of William Shakespeare , created by Cedric Messina and broadcast by BBC Television . Transmitted in the UK from 3 December 1978 to 27 April 1985 , the series spanned seven seasons and thirty-seven episodes . Development began in 1975 when Messina saw that the grounds of Glamis Castle would make a perfect location for an adaptation of Shakespeare 's As You Like It for the Play of the Month series . Upon returning to London , however , he had come to envision an entire series devoted exclusively to the dramatic works of Shakespeare . When he encountered a less than enthusiastic response from the BBC 's departmental heads , Messina bypassed the usual channels and took his idea directly to the top of the BBC hierarchy , who greenlighted the show . Experiencing financial , logistical and creative problems in the early days of production , Messina persevered and served as executive producer for two years . When he was replaced by Jonathan Miller at the start of season three , the show experienced something of a creative renaissance as strictures on the directors ' interpretations of the plays were loosened , a policy continued under Shaun Sutton , who took over as executive producer for seasons five , six and seven . By the end of its run , the series had proved both a ratings and a financial success . Initially the adaptations received generally negative reviews , although the reception improved somewhat as the series went on , and directors were allowed more freedom , leading to interpretations becoming more daring . Several episodes are now held in high esteem , particularly some of the traditionally lesser known and less frequently staged plays . The complete set is a popular collection , and several episodes represent the only non-theatrical production of the particular play currently available on DVD .",
