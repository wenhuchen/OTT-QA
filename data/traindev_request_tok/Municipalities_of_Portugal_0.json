It is an archipelago composed of nine volcanic islands in the Macaronesia region of the North Atlantic Ocean , about 1,360 km ( 850 mi ) west of continental Portugal , about 1,500 km ( 930 mi ) west of Lisbon , in continental Portugal , about 1,500 km ( 930 mi ) northwest of Morocco , and about 2,500 km ( 1,600 mi ) southeast of Newfoundland , Canada . Its main industries are agriculture , dairy farming , livestock , fishing , and tourism , which is becoming the major service activity in the region . In addition , the government of the Azores employs a large percentage of the population directly or indirectly in the service and tertiary sectors . The main city of the Azores is Ponta Delgada . There are nine major Azorean islands and an islet cluster , in three main groups . These are Flores and Corvo , to the west ; Graciosa , Terceira , S\u00e3o Jorge , Pico , and Faial in the centre ; and S\u00e3o Miguel , Santa Maria , and the Formigas Reef to the east .

The climate of the Azores is very mild for such a northerly location , being influenced by its distance from the continents and by the passing Gulf Stream .",
