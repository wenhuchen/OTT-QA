The Rams played their home games at what is now known as The Dome at America 's Center in downtown St. Louis , which the city had been constructing for the previous few years in the hopes of gaining an NFL team . The city was left out of the expansion that brought Charlotte and Jacksonville into the league for 1995 and another attempt to secure a franchise fell through when the ownership group controlling the New England Patriots was forced out of power by their stadium 's owner and operator . The Rams new stadium was not ready for them when they initially arrived in Missouri , so they were forced to temporarily share Busch Memorial Stadium with the St. Louis Cardinals . Their first game in St. Louis against the New Orleans Saints was played on September 10 , 1995 with the Rams winning 17-13 . The then- Trans World Dome opened on November 12 , 1995 with the home team scoring a 28-17 victory against the Carolina Panthers . The Rams ' last game played in St. Louis , in what was by then known as the Edward Jones Dome , was against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on December 17 , 2015 , which they won , 31-23 . The Rams last game as a St. Louis-based franchise was on January 3 , 2016 , against the San Francisco 49ers at Levi 's Stadium , when they lost in overtime 19-16 .",
