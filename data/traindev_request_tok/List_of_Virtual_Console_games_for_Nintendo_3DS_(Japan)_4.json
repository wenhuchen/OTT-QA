By 1963 , the company had tried several small niche businesses , such as cab services and love hotels , without major success . Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s , Nintendo developed into a video game company in the 1970s .

  "/wiki/EarthBound": "EarthBound ( known as Mother 2 in Japan ) [ nb 1 ] is a role-playing video game developed by Ape Inc. and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . The second entry in the Mother series , it was first released in Japan in August 1994 , and in North America in June 1995 . As Ness and his party of four , the player travels the world to collect melodies from eight Sanctuaries in order to defeat the evil alien force Giygas . EarthBound had a lengthy development period that spanned five years . Its returning staff from Mother ( 1989 ) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer Satoru Iwata , as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka , who incorporated a diverse range of styles into the soundtrack , including salsa , reggae , and dub . Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original Mother , and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team . Originally scheduled for release in January 1993 , the game was completed around May 1994 . Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture , EarthBound subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a real world setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre . Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone ; for example , the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues , experiences in-game hallucinations , and battles piles of vomit , taxi cabs , and walking nooses . For its American release , the game was marketed with a $ 2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed this game stinks . Additionally , the game 's puns and humor were reworked by localizer Marcus Lindblom , and the title was changed from Mother 2 to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to . Initial reviewers had little praise for EarthBound in the United States , where it sold half as many copies as in Japan .",
