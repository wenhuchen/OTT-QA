  "/wiki/Baldur's_Gate": "Baldur 's Gate is a fantasy role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published in 1998 by Interplay Entertainment . It is the first game in the Baldur 's Gate series and takes place in the Forgotten Realms , a high fantasy campaign setting , using a modified version of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ( AD & D ) 2nd edition rules . It was the first game to use the Infinity Engine for its graphics , with Interplay using the engine for other Forgotten Realms-licensed games , including the Icewind Dale series , as well as other licensed D & D campaign worlds such as Planescape : Torment . The game 's story focuses on players controlling a protagonist of their own creation who finds themselves travelling across the Sword Coast alongside a party of companions , to unravel the mystery surrounding a sudden iron crisis affecting the region and attempting to discover the culprits behind it , while uncovering dark secrets about their origins and dealing with attempts on their life . The game received critical acclaim following its release and was credited for revitalizing computer role-playing games . An expansion pack entitled Tales of the Sword Coast was released , as was a sequel entitled Baldur 's Gate II : Shadows of Amn , which later received its own expansion called Throne of Bhaal . An enhanced version of the Infinity Engine was later created as part of Beamdog 's remake , entitled Baldur 's Gate : Enhanced Edition , the first new release in the franchise in nearly nine years .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS": "Classic Mac OS [ a ] ( System Software ) refers to the series of operating systems developed for the Macintosh family of personal computers by Apple Inc. from 1984 to 2001 , starting with System 1 and ending with Mac OS 9 . The Macintosh operating system is credited with having popularized the graphical user interface concept . It was included with every Macintosh that was sold during the era in which it was developed , and many updates to the system software were done in conjunction with the introduction of new Macintosh systems . Apple released the original Macintosh on January 24 , 1984 . The first version of the system software , which had no official name , was partially based on the Lisa OS , which Apple previously released for the Lisa computer in 1983 . As part of an agreement allowing Xerox to buy shares in Apple at a favorable price , it also used concepts from the Xerox PARC Alto computer , which former Apple CEO Steve Jobs and other Lisa team members had previewed . This operating system consisted of the Macintosh Toolbox ROM and the System Folder , a set of files that were loaded from disk . The name Macintosh System Software came into use in 1987 with System 5 . Apple rebranded the system as Mac OS in 1996 , starting officially with version 7.6 , due in part to its Macintosh clone program . That program ended after the release of Mac OS 8 in 1997 . The last major release of the system was Mac OS 9 in 1999 . Initial versions of the System Software run one application at a time .",

The storyline revolves around the machinations of Irenicus and the player 's encounters with him . Development began in January 1999 . BioWare set out to improve upon the first Baldur 's Gate in every way possible . From a list of constructive criticism - compiled from the suggestions of fans , reviews , and internal suggestions - a list of features to be added to the game was distilled : some of these were 800 x 600 resolution , 3D support , and character kits .

Unlike online services from Sega and Sony , Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated Ethernet port . The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a competitor in the sixth-generation of consoles . The popularity of blockbuster titles such as Bungie 's Halo 2 contributed to the popularity of online console gaming , and in particular first-person shooters . The Xbox had a record-breaking launch in North America , selling 1.5 million units before the end of 2001 , aided by the popularity of one of the system 's launch titles , Halo : Combat Evolved , which sold a million units by April 2002 . The system went on to sell a worldwide total of 24 million units , including 16 million in North America ; however , Microsoft was unable to make a steady profit off of the console , which had a manufacturing price far more expensive than its retail price , despite its popularity , losing over $ 4 billion during its market life .",

The service is planned to be integrated with YouTube , and its state share feature will allow viewers of a Stadia stream to launch a game on the service on the same save state as the streamer . This has been used as a selling point for the service . It is compatible with HID class USB controllers , though a proprietary controller manufactured by Google with a direct Wi-Fi link to data centers is available alongside the service . Stadia is not similar to Netflix , in that it requires users to purchase games to stream via Stadia rather than pay for access to a library of games . While the base service will be free , a Pro tier monthly subscription allows users to stream at higher rates for larger resolutions , and the offer to add free games to their library . Known in development as Project Stream , the service was debuted through a closed beta running Assassin 's Creed Odyssey in October 2018 . Stadia was publicly released on November 19 , 2019 in selected countries and received a mixed reception from reviewers .
