  "/wiki/Alec_Gillon": "Alexander George Gillon AM OBE ( 23 December 1909 - 25 August 2007 ) was a civic and sporting administrator in Melbourne , Australia . He was most notable as the longest-serving president of the Victorian Football Association , and as a mayor of the City of Brunswick . Gillon was born in Broadmeadows in north-western Melbourne . He played Australian rules football when he was young , and at his peak played 88 games for the Brunswick Football Club in the Victorian Football Association ( VFA ) during the 1930s , where he was part of Brunswick 's 1938 premiership team . He was cleared to Coburg in May 1939 and played there for one season . After World War II , Gillon took a position on the Brunswick Football Club committee . He served as a club delegate on the VFA Board of Management from 1949 until 1953 . Then in February 1954 , he successfully challenged Lewis Page for presidency of the VFA . When Gillon took on the presidency , the VFA was in decline and struggling badly compared with the strong position it had enjoyed during the 1940s : crowds were declining due to the abandoning of the popular throw pass rule in 1950 , various social and demographic changes in post-war Melbourne were reducing crowds and revenues , and the Association board was suffering from factional fighting as a result of the fall-out from the changes . Gillon soon provided strong leadership , which largely re-unified the Association 's board , and the Association began to recover from a situation which threatened its viability . One of the first challenges Gillon faced during his presidency was grounds control , as there were several bids by other football codes during the 1950s , and then by Victorian Football League ( VFL ) clubs during the 1960s , to take over the tenancy of VFA grounds ; Gillon refused to compromise on the VFA 's requirement that clubs had sole winter use of their grounds , which cost Prahran ( temporarily ) and Moorabbin ( permanently ) their places in the Association , but it set a strong example that the VFA was prepared to defend itself against stronger opponents , a trait which Gillon carried throughout his presidency . Gillon then oversaw the introduction of Sunday football in 1960 , the early 1960s expansion of the Association into the outer suburbs to overcome post-war demographic shifts in the inner suburbs , and the partitioning of the VFA into two divisions in 1961 ; and after the VFA secured weekly television coverage from 1967 , the VFA enjoyed one of its most successful periods ever during the 1970s .",
