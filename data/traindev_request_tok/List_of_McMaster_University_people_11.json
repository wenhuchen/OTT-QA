  "/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer_(United_Kingdom)": "In the United Kingdom , the Chief Medical Officer ( CMO ) is the most senior government advisor on health matters . There are four CMOs in the United Kingdom who are appointed to advise their respective governments : Her Majesty 's Government ( CMO for England and medical adviser to the United Kingdom government ) , the Northern Ireland Executive , the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government . Each CMO is assisted by one or more Deputy Chief Medical Officers , and are complemented by a Chief Nursing Officer . In England , the CMO is a civil servant ( Permanent Secretary level ) in the Department of Health and Social Care , and head of the medical civil service and public health . The Republic of Ireland has a similar officer . The Chief Medical Officer is a qualified medical doctor whose medical speciality traditionally was public health medicine , and whose work focused on the health of communities rather than health of individuals . More recently some appointees have been senior clinicians without training in public health medicine . In the UK , the CMO is one of the chief professional officers who advise the government in their respective health and social care disciplines . The nearest equivalents US terms are Surgeon General or Assistant Secretary for Health . The term Surgeon General is also a used in the British Armed Forces for the head of medical services . In non-government organisations , companies or bodies such as policing , chief medical officer may refer to a senior medical post in the organisation .",

The author of numerous works on Canadian political history , she is best known for The Political Thought of Lord Durham , where she argues that Durham 's call for French-Canadian assimilation was consistent with liberal principles . Her view of Canadian federalism , which dismisses the idea of special status for Quebec or Indigenous people , provoked much scholarly debate , especially following the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord . Ajzenstat also contends that judicial activism undercuts the foundation of responsible government ; as a result , her work is well received by conservative scholars , such as Barry Cooper and Stephen Harper 's former chief of staff Ian Brodie . Ajzenstat received her Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Toronto under the supervision of Peter H. Russell . While a doctoral student , she was a teaching assistant for Allan Bloom 's introductory political philosophy course . She has described Bloom as a major influence on her own thought . As an undergraduate at University College , University of Toronto , Ajzenstat majored in art and archeology . Following graduation in 1959 , she worked at the Art Gallery of Ontario , only turning to political science in the mid-1960s . She is married to philosopher and fellow McMaster professor Samuel Ajzenstat . Their daughter , Oona Eisenstadt , is a professor of Jewish studies at Pomona College .

  "/wiki/Richard_Bader": "Richard F. W. Bader ( October 15 , 1931 - January 15 , 2012 ) was a Canadian quantum chemist , noted for his work on the Atoms in molecules theory . This theory attempts to establish a physical basis for many of the working concepts of chemistry , such as atoms in molecules and bonding , in terms of the topology of the electron density function in three-dimensional space . He was born in 1931 in Kitchener , Ontario , Canada . His parents were Albert Bader and Alvina Bader , who immigrated from Switzerland . His father was a butcher at Burns Pride of Canada and his mother was a housekeeper at Kitchener Hospital of Waterloo . He received a scholarship from McMaster University that allowed him to earn a BSC in 1953 . His father was his best supporter who encouraged him and taught him to never quit his education and his dream . He finished his master 's degree in science at McMaster University in 1955 .

  "/wiki/Atoms_in_molecules": "The quantum theory of atoms in molecules ( QTAIM ) is a model of molecular and condensed matter electronic systems ( such as crystals ) in which the principal objects of molecular structure - atoms and bonds - are natural expressions of a system 's observable electron density distribution function . An electron density distribution of a molecule is a probability distribution that describes the average manner in which the electronic charge is distributed throughout real space in the attractive field exerted by the nuclei . According to QTAIM , molecular structure is revealed by the stationary points of the electron density together with the gradient paths of the electron density that originate and terminate at these points . QTAIM was primarily developed by Professor Richard Bader and his research group at McMaster University over the course of decades , beginning with analyses of theoretically calculated electron densities of simple molecules in the early 1960s and culminating with analyses of both theoretically and experimentally measured electron densities of crystals in the 90s . The development of QTAIM was driven by the assumption that , since the concepts of atoms and bonds have been and continue to be so ubiquitously useful in interpreting , classifying , predicting and communicating chemistry , they should have a well-defined physical basis . QTAIM recovers the central operational concepts of the molecular structure hypothesis , that of a functional grouping of atoms with an additive and characteristic set of properties , together with a definition of the bonds that link the atoms and impart the structure . QTAIM defines chemical bonding and structure of a chemical system based on the topology of the electron density . In addition to bonding , AIM allows the calculation of certain physical properties on a per-atom basis , by dividing space up into atomic volumes containing exactly one nucleus , which acts as a local attractor of the electron density . In QTAIM an atom is defined as a proper open system , i.e . a system that can share energy and electron density which is localized in the 3D space . The mathematical study of these features is usually referred to in the literature as charge density topology . QTAIM rests on the fact that the dominant topological property of the vast majority of electron density distributions is the presence of strong maxima that occur exclusively at the nuclei , certain pairs of which are linked together by ridges of electron density .",

  "/wiki/Surrogate_model": "A surrogate model is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest can not be easily directly measured , [ disputed - discuss ] so a model of the outcome is used instead . Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as a function of design variables . For example , in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing , an engineer simulates the airflow around the wing for different shape variables ( length , curvature , material , . ) . For many real-world problems , however , a single simulation can take many minutes , hours , or even days to complete . As a result , routine tasks such as design optimization , design space exploration , sensitivity analysis and what-if analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations . One way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models , known as surrogate models , response surface models , metamodels or emulators , that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap ( er ) to evaluate . Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven , bottom-up approach . The exact , inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known ( or even understood ) , solely the input-output behavior is important . A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points . This approach is also known as behavioral modeling or black-box modeling , though the terminology is not always consistent . When only a single design variable is involved , the process is known as curve fitting . Though using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common , surrogate modeling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments and/or function evaluations .",
