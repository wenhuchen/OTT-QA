  "/wiki/Baggara": "The Bagg\u0101ra are a grouping of Arab ethnic groups inhabiting the portion of Africa 's Sahel mainly between Lake Chad and southern Kordofan , numbering over six million . They are known as Baggara in Sudan , and as Shuwa/Diffa Arabs in Chad and Nigeria . Their name derives from the Arabic word ( Arabic : \u0628\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0629 ) literally meaning cattle herder . They have a common language , Shuwa Arabic , which is one of the regional varieties of Arabic . They also have a common traditional mode of subsistence , nomadic cattle herding , although nowadays many lead a settled existence . Nevertheless , collectively they do not all necessarily consider themselves one people , i.e. , a single ethnic group . The term baggara culture was introduced in 1994 by Brauk\u00e4mper . The political use of the term baggara in Sudan denoting a particular set of tribes is limited to Sudan . It often means a coalition of majority Arabs and a few indigenous African tribes ( mainly Fur , Nuba and Fallata ) with other Arab tribes of western Sudan ( mainly Guhayna ) , as opposed to Bedouin Abbala Arab tribes . The bulk of baggara Arabs live in Chad , the rest live , or seasonally migrate to , southwest Sudan ( specifically the southern portions of Darfur and Kordofan ) , and slivers of the Central African Republic , South Sudan , and Niger . Those who are still nomads migrate seasonally between grazing lands in the wet season and river areas in the dry season . Their common language is known to academics by various names , such as Chadian Arabic , taken from the regions where the language is spoken .",

Berbers mostly live in Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , Libya , Mauritania , northern Mali , northern Niger , and a small part of western Egypt . Berber nations are distributed over an area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Siwa Oasis in Egypt and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Niger River in West Africa . Historically , Berber nations spoke the Berber language , which is a branch of the Afroasiatic language family . The Berbers of Algeria were independent of outside control during the period of Ottoman Empire rule in North Africa . They lived primarily in three different Nations : the Kingdom of Ait Abbas , Kingdom of Kuku , and the principality of A\u00eft Jubar . The Kingdom of Ait Abbas is a Berber nation of North Africa , controlling Lesser Kabylie and its surroundings from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century . It is referred to in the Spanish historiography as reino de Labes ; [ full citation needed ] sometimes more commonly referred to by its ruling family , the Mokrani , in Berber At Muqran , in Arabic \u0623\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0646 ( Ouled Moqrane ) .

They comprise a group of closely related languages spoken by the Berbers , who are indigenous to North Africa . The languages were traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script , which now exists in the form of Tifinagh . Berber is spoken by large populations of Morocco , Algeria and Libya , by smaller populations of Tunisia , northern Mali , western and northern Niger , northern Burkina Faso and Mauritania and in the Siwa Oasis of Egypt . Large Berber-speaking migrant communities , today numbering about 4 million , have been living in Western Europe , spanning over three generations , since the 1950s . The number of Berber people is much higher than the number of Berber speakers . Around 90% of the Berber-speaking population speak one of seven major varieties of Berber , each with at least 2 million speakers . They are , in order of number of speakers : Shilha ( Tacel\u1e25iyt ) , Kabyle ( Taqbaylit ) , Central Atlas Tamazight ( Tamazi\u0263t ) , Riffian ( internal : Tmazi\u0263t , external : Tarifiyt ) , Shawiya ( Tacawit ) and Tuareg ( Tamaceq/Tamajeq/Tamaheq ) . The now extinct Guanche language spoken on the Canary Islands by the Guanches , as well as possibly the languages of the ancient C-Group culture in today 's southern Egypt and northern Sudan , are believed to have belonged to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family . The Berber languages and dialects have had a written tradition , on and off , for about 2,500 years , although the tradition has been frequently disrupted by cultural shifts and invasions . They were first written in the Libyco-Berber abjad , which is still used today by the Tuareg in the form of Tifinagh . The oldest dated inscription is from 3rd century BCE .",

Several distinct Coptic dialects are identified , the most prominent of which are Sahidic , originating in parts of Upper Egypt and Bohairic , originally from the western Nile Delta in Lower Egypt . Coptic and Demotic are grammatically closely related to Late Egyptian , which was written with Egyptian hieroglyphs . Coptic flourished as a literary language from the 2nd to 13th centuries and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria . It was supplanted by Egyptian Arabic as a spoken language toward the early modern period , but language revitalization efforts have been underway since the 19th century .",

Egyptian Arabic evolved from the Quranic Arabic which was brought to Egypt during the seventh-century AD Muslim conquest that aimed to spread the Islamic faith among the Egyptians . Egyptian Arabic is mainly influenced by the Egyptian Coptic language and its grammar structure which was the native language of the vast majority of Nile Valley Egyptians prior to the Islamic conquest , and later it had small influences by European and foreign languages such as French , Italian , Greek , Turkish , and English . The 94 million Egyptians speak a continuum of dialects , among which Cairene is the most prominent . It is also understood across most of the Arabic-speaking countries due to the predominance of Egyptian influence on the region as well as Egyptian media including Egyptian cinema which has had a big influence in the MENA region for more than a century along with the Egyptian music industry , making it the most widely spoken and by far the most widely studied variety . While it is essentially a spoken language , it is encountered in written form in novels , plays , and poems ( vernacular literature ) , as well as in comics , advertising , some newspapers , and transcriptions of popular songs . In most other written media and in television news reporting , Literary Arabic is used . Literary Arabic is a standardized language based on the language of the Quran , that is , Classical Arabic .

During the colonial era , the Portuguese introduced the names Ceylon Moors and Indian Moors in South Asia and Sri Lanka , and the Bengali Muslims were also called Moors .

They speak Nubian languages , part of the Northern Eastern Sudanic languages . Early Neolithic settlements from prehistoric Egypt have been found in the central Nubian region dating back to 7000 BC , with Wadi Halfa believed to be the oldest settlement in the central Nile valley . Parts of Nubia , such as Ta-Seti ( the first nome or administrative region of ancient Egypt ) , were continuously a part of ancient Egypt throughout the dynastic era . Other parts of Nubia , particularly Lower or Upper Nubia , were at times a part of ancient Pharaonic Egypt and at other times a rival state representing parts of Mero\u00eb or the Kingdom of Kush . However , by the Twenty-fifth Dynasty , all of Nubia was united with Egypt , extending down to what is now Khartoum . Towards the end of the dynastic era , Upper Nubia broke off from Egypt proper . During that time , the Nubians founded a dynasty that ruled Upper and Lower Egypt in the eighth century BC . As warriors , the ancient Nubians were famous for their skill and precision with the bow and arrow . In the medieval period the Nubians converted to Christianity and established three kingdoms : Nobatia in the north , Makuria in the center and Alodia in the south . Today , Africans of Nubian descent primarily live in southern Egypt , especially in the Luxor and Aswan area , and in northern Sudan , particularly in the region between the city of Wadi Halfa on the Egyptian-Sudanese border and al Dabbah .
