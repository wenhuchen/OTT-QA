  "/wiki/Battle_of_Princeton": "The Battle of Princeton was a battle of the American Revolutionary War , fought near Princeton , New Jersey on January 3 , 1777 , and ending in a small victory for the Colonials . General Lord Cornwallis had left 1,400 British troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood in Princeton . Following a surprise attack at Trenton early in the morning of December 26 , 1776 , General George Washington of the Continental Army decided to attack the British in New Jersey before entering the winter quarters . On December 30 , he crossed the Delaware River back into New Jersey . His troops followed on January 3 , 1777 . Washington advanced to Princeton by a back road , where he pushed back a smaller British force but had to retreat before Cornwallis arrived with reinforcements . The battles of Trenton and Princeton were a boost to the morale of the patriot cause , leading many recruits to join the Continental Army in the spring . After defeating the Hessians at the Battle of Trenton on the morning of December 26 , 1776 , Washington withdrew back to Pennsylvania . He subsequently decided to attack the British forces before going into winter quarters . On December 29 , he led his army back into Trenton . On the night of January 2 , 1777 , Washington repulsed a British attack at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek . That night , he evacuated his position , circled around General Cornwallis ' army , and went to attack the British garrison at Princeton .",

  "/wiki/Saratoga_campaign": "The Saratoga campaign in 1777 was an attempt by the British high command for North America to gain military control of the strategically important Hudson River valley during the American Revolutionary War . It ended in the surrender of the British army , which historian Edmund Morgan argues , was a great turning point of the war , because it won for Americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory . The primary thrust of the campaign was planned and initiated by General John Burgoyne . Commanding a main force of some 8,000 men , he moved south in June from Quebec , boated up Lake Champlain to middle New York , then marched over the divide and down the Hudson Valley to Saratoga . He initially skirmished there with the Patriot defenders with mixed results . Then , after losses in the Battles of Saratoga in September and October , his deteriorating position and the ever-increasing size of the American army forced him to surrender his forces to the American general Horatio Gates on October 17 . In this critical British loss on the field of battle , the coordinated movements that had been drawn up in far away London did not materialize . Colonel Barry St. Leger had been assigned to move east through the Mohawk River valley on Albany , New York , but was forced to retreat during the Siege of Fort Stanwix after losing his Indian allies . The major expedition planned from the south was not launched due to miscommunication with London when General William Howe sent his army to take Philadelphia rather than sending it up the Hudson River to link up with Burgoyne . A last-minute effort to reinforce Burgoyne from New York City was made in early October , but it was too little , too late . The American victory was an enormous morale boost to the fledgling nation . More importantly , it convinced France to enter the war in alliance with the United States , openly providing money , soldiers , and munitions , as well as fighting a naval war worldwide against Britain .",
  "/wiki/George_Washington": "George Washington ( February 22 , 1732 [ b ] - December 14 , 1799 ) was an American political leader , military general , statesman , and Founding Father who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797 . Previously , he led Patriot forces to victory in the nation 's War for Independence . He presided at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , which established the U.S. Constitution and a federal government . Washington has been called the Father of His Country for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the new nation . Washington received his initial military training and command with the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War . He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress , where he was appointed Commanding General of the Continental Army . He commanded American forces , allied with France , in the defeat and surrender of the British during the Siege of Yorktown . He resigned his commission after the Treaty of Paris in 1783 . Washington played a key role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution and was then elected president ( twice ) by the Electoral College . He implemented a strong , well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton . During the French Revolution , he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty . He set enduring precedents for the office of president , including the title President of the United States , and his Farewell Address is widely regarded as a pre-eminent statement on republicanism .",
  "/wiki/Philadelphia_campaign": "The Philadelphia campaign ( 1777-1778 ) was a British initiative in the American Revolutionary War to gain control of Philadelphia , which was then the seat of the Second Continental Congress . British General William Howe , after unsuccessfully attempting to draw the Continental Army under General George Washington into a battle in northern New Jersey , embarked his army on transports , and landed them at the northern end of Chesapeake Bay . From there , he advanced northward toward Philadelphia . Washington prepared defenses against Howe 's movements at Brandywine Creek , but was flanked and beaten back in the Battle of Brandywine on September 11 , 1777 . After further skirmishes and maneuvers , Howe was able to enter and occupy Philadelphia . Washington then unsuccessfully attacked one of Howe 's garrisons at Germantown before retreating to Valley Forge for the winter . Howe 's campaign was controversial because , although he successfully captured the American capital of Philadelphia , he proceeded slowly and did not aid the concurrent campaign of John Burgoyne further north , which ended in disaster at Saratoga for the British , and brought France into the war . General Howe resigned during the occupation of Philadelphia and was replaced by his second-in-command , General Sir Henry Clinton . Clinton evacuated the troops from Philadelphia back to New York City in 1778 in order to increase that city 's defenses against a possible Franco-American attack . Washington harried the British army all the way across New Jersey , and successfully forced a battle at Monmouth Court House that was one of the largest battles of the war . At the end of the campaign the two armies were roughly in the same positions they were at its beginning .",
  "/wiki/Valley_Forge": "Valley Forge functioned as the third of eight military encampments for the Continental Army 's main body , commanded by General George Washington . In September 1777 , British forces had captured the American capital of Philadelphia . After failing to retake the city , Washington led his 12,000-man army into winter quarters at Valley Forge , located approximately 18 miles ( 29 km ) northwest of Philadelphia . They remained there for six months , from December 19 , 1777 to June 19 , 1778 . At Valley Forge , the Continentals struggled to manage a disastrous supply crisis while retraining and reorganizing their units . About 1,700 to 2,000 soldiers died from disease , possibly exacerbated by malnutrition . Today , Valley Forge National Historical Park preserves and protects over 3,500 acres of the original encampment site .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Monmouth": "The Battle of Monmouth was fought near Monmouth Court House ( modern-day Freehold Borough , New Jersey ) on June 28 , 1778 , during the American Revolutionary War . It pitted the Continental Army , commanded by General George Washington , against the British Army in North America , commanded by General Sir Henry Clinton . It was the last battle of the Philadelphia campaign , begun the previous year , during which the British had inflicted two major defeats on Washington and occupied Philadelphia . Washington had spent the winter at Valley Forge rebuilding his army and defending his position against political enemies who favored his replacement as commander-in-chief . In February 1778 , the Franco-American alliance tilted the strategic balance in favor of the Americans , forcing the British to abandon hopes of a military victory and adopt a defensive strategy . Clinton was ordered to evacuate Philadelphia and consolidate his army . The Continental Army shadowed the British as they marched across New Jersey to Sandy Hook , from where the Royal Navy would ferry them to New York . Washington 's senior officers urged varying degrees of caution , but it was politically important for him not to allow the British to withdraw unscathed . Washington detached around a third of his army and sent it ahead under the command of Major General Charles Lee , hoping to land a heavy blow on the British without becoming embroiled in a major engagement . The battle began badly for the Americans when Lee botched an attack on the British rearguard at Monmouth Court House . A counter-attack by the main British column forced Lee to retreat until Washington arrived with the main body . Clinton disengaged when he found Washington in an unassailable defensive position and resumed the march to Sandy Hook .",
  "/wiki/Battle_of_Rhode_Island": "The Battle of Rhode Island ( also known as the Battle of Quaker Hill and the Battle of Newport ) took place on August 29 , 1778 . Continental Army and militia forces under the command of General John Sullivan had been besieging the British forces in Newport , Rhode Island , which is situated on Aquidneck Island , but they had finally abandoned their siege and were withdrawing to the northern part of the island . The British forces then sortied , supported by recently arrived Royal Navy ships , and they attacked the retreating Americans . The battle ended inconclusively , but the Continental forces withdrew to the mainland and left Aquidneck Island in British hands . The battle was the first attempt at cooperation between French and American forces following France 's entry into the war as an American ally . Operations against Newport were planned in conjunction with a French fleet and troops , but they were frustrated in part by difficult relations between the commanders , as well as by a storm that damaged both French and British fleets shortly before joint operations were to begin . The battle was also notable for the participation of the 1st Rhode Island Regiment under the command of Colonel Christopher Greene , which consisted of Africans , American Indians , and white colonists .",
  "/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown": "The siege of Yorktown , also known as the Battle of Yorktown , the surrender at Yorktown , German Battle or the siege of Little York , [ a ] [ b ] ending on October 19 , 1781 , at Yorktown , Virginia , was a decisive victory by a combined force of American Continental Army troops led by General George Washington and French Army troops led by the Comte de Rochambeau over a British army commanded by British peer and Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis . The culmination of the Yorktown campaign , the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the American Revolutionary War in the North American region , as the surrender by Cornwallis , and the capture of both him and his army , prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict . The battle boosted faltering American morale and revived French enthusiasm for the war , as well as undermining popular support for the conflict in Great Britain . In 1780 , about 5,500 French soldiers landed in Rhode Island to help their American allies fight the British troops who controlled New York City . Following the arrival of dispatches from France that included the possibility of support from the French West Indies fleet of the Comte de Grasse , Washington and Rochambeau decided to ask de Grasse for assistance either in besieging New York , or in military operations against a British army operating in Virginia . On the advice of Rochambeau , de Grasse informed them of his intent to sail to the Chesapeake Bay , where Cornwallis had taken command of the army . Cornwallis , at first given confusing orders by his superior officer , Henry Clinton , was eventually ordered to build a defensible deep-water port , which he began to do in Yorktown . Cornwallis ' movements in Virginia were shadowed by a Continental Army force led by the Marquis de Lafayette . The French and American armies united north of New York City during the summer of 1781 . When word of de Grasse 's decision arrived , both armies began moving south toward Virginia , engaging in tactics of deception to lead the British to believe a siege of New York was planned . De Grasse sailed from the West Indies and arrived at the Chesapeake Bay at the end of August , bringing additional troops and creating a naval blockade of Yorktown . He was transporting 500,000 silver pesos collected from the citizens of Havana , Cuba , to fund supplies for the siege and payroll for the Continental Army .",

January 3 , 1740 ] - June 14 , 1801 ) was an American military officer who served as a general during the American Revolutionary War , fighting for the American Continental Army before defecting to the British in 1780 . George Washington had given him his fullest trust and placed him in command of the fortifications at West Point , New York . Arnold planned to surrender the fort to British forces , but the plot was discovered in September 1780 and he fled to the British . His name quickly became a byword in the United States for treason and betrayal because he led the British army in battle against the very men whom he had once commanded . Arnold was born in the Connecticut Colony and was a merchant operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war began in 1775 . He joined the growing army outside Boston and distinguished himself through acts of intelligence and bravery . His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775 , defensive and delaying tactics at the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776 which allowed American forces time to prepare New York 's defenses , the Battle of Ridgefield , Connecticut ( after which he was promoted to major general ) , operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix , and key actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777 , in which he suffered leg injuries that halted his combat career for several years . Arnold repeatedly claimed that he was passed over for promotion by the Continental Congress , while other officers obtained credit for some of his accomplishments . Others in his military and political circles brought charges against him of corruption or other malfeasance , but most often he was acquitted in formal inquiries . Congress investigated his accounts , however , and concluded that he was indebted to Congress , and he borrowed heavily to maintain a lavish lifestyle . Arnold mingled with Loyalist sympathizers in Philadelphia and married into one such family by marrying Peggy Shippen .",
  "/wiki/Siege_of_Fort_Stanwix": "The Siege of Fort Stanwix ( also known at the time as Fort Schuyler ) began on August 2 , 1777 , and ended August 22 . Fort Stanwix , in the western part of the Mohawk River Valley , was then the primary defense point for the Continental Army against British and Indian forces aligned against them in the American Revolutionary War . The fort was occupied by Continental Army forces from New York and Massachusetts under the command of Colonel Peter Gansevoort . The besieging force was composed of British regulars , American Loyalists , Hessian soldiers from Hesse-Hanau , and Indians , under the command of British Brigadier General Barry St. Leger and the Iroquois leader Joseph Brant . St. Leger 's expedition was a diversion in support of General John Burgoyne 's campaign to gain control of the Hudson River Valley to the east . One attempt at relief was thwarted early in the siege when a force of New York militia under Nicholas Herkimer was stopped in the August 6 Battle of Oriskany by a detachment of St. Leger 's forces . While that battle did not involve the fort 's garrison , some of its occupants sortied and raided the nearly empty Indian and Loyalist camps , which was a blow to the morale of St. Leger 's Indian support . They killed some Seneca . The siege was finally broken when American reinforcements under the command of Benedict Arnold neared , and Arnold used a ruse , with the assistance of Herkimer 's relative Hon Yost Schuyler , to convince the besiegers that a much larger force was arriving . This misinformation , combined with the departure of Indian fighters not interested in siege warfare and upset over their losses from the raids , led St. Leger to abandon the effort and retreat . St. Leger 's failure to advance on Albany contributed to Burgoyne 's surrender following the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777 . Although St. Leger reached Fort Ticonderoga in late September , he was too late to aid Burgoyne .",

The raiders were under the overall command of Walter Butler , who exercised little authority over the Indians on the expedition . Historian Barbara Graymont describes Butler 's command of the expedition as criminally incompetent . The Seneca were angered by accusations that they had committed atrocities at the Battle of Wyoming , and the colonists ' recent destruction of their forward bases of operation at Unadilla , Onaquaga , and Tioga . Butler 's authority with the Indians was undermined by his poor treatment of Joseph Brant , the leader of the Mohawks . Butler repeatedly maintained , against accusations that he permitted the atrocities to take place , that he was powerless to restrain the Seneca . During the campaigns of 1778 , Brant achieved an undeserved reputation for brutality . He was not present at Wyoming - although many thought he was - and he actively sought to minimize the atrocities that took place at Cherry Valley . Diaries belonging to British soldiers during the campaign state the regiment as being the butchers and given that Butler was the overall commander of the expedition , there is controversy as to who actually ordered or failed to restrain the killings .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Bunker_Hill": "The Battle of Bunker Hill was fought on June 17 , 1775 , during the Siege of Boston in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War . The battle is named after Bunker Hill in Charlestown , Massachusetts , which was peripherally involved in the battle . It was the original objective of both the colonial and British troops , though the majority of combat took place on the adjacent hill which later became known as Breed 's Hill . On June 13 , 1775 , the leaders of the colonial forces besieging Boston learned that the British were planning to send troops out from the city to fortify the unoccupied hills surrounding the city , which would give them control of Boston Harbor . In response , 1,200 colonial troops under the command of William Prescott stealthily occupied Bunker Hill and Breed 's Hill . During the night , the colonists constructed a strong redoubt on Breed 's Hill , as well as smaller fortified lines across the Charlestown Peninsula . By daybreak of June 17 , the British became aware of the presence of colonial forces on the Peninsula and mounted an attack against them that day . Two assaults on the colonial positions were repulsed with significant British casualties ; the third and final attack carried the redoubt after the defenders ran out of ammunition . The colonists retreated to Cambridge over Bunker Hill , leaving the British in control of the Peninsula . The battle was a tactical , though somewhat Pyrrhic victory for the British , as it proved to be a sobering experience for them , involving many more casualties than the Americans had incurred , including many officers . The battle had demonstrated that inexperienced militia were able to stand up to regular army troops in battle . Subsequently , the battle discouraged the British from any further frontal attacks against well defended front lines .",

On the morning of July 7 , 1777 , British forces , under General Simon Fraser , caught up with the American rear guard of the forces retreating after the withdrawal from Fort Ticonderoga . It was the only battle in Vermont during the revolution . ( The Battle of Bennington was fought in what is now Walloomsac , New York . ) The American retreat from Fort Ticonderoga began late on July 5 after British cannons were seen on top of high ground , Mount Defiance ( a.k.a . Rattlesnake Mountain and Sugar Loaf Hill ) that commanded the fort . The bulk of General Arthur St. Clair 's army retreated through Hubbardton to Castleton , while the rear guard , commanded by Seth Warner , stopped at Hubbardton to rest and pick up stragglers . General Fraser , alerted to the American withdrawal early on July 6 , immediately set out in pursuit , leaving a message for General John Burgoyne to send reinforcements as quickly as possible . That night Fraser camped a few miles short of Hubbardton , and the German General Friedrich Adolf Riedesel , leading reinforcements , camped a few miles further back . Rising early in the morning , Fraser reached Hubbardton , where he surprised some elements of the American rear , while other elements managed to form defensive lines . In spirited battle , the Americans were driven back , but had almost succeeded in turning Fraser 's left flank when Riedesel and his German reinforcements arrived , eventually scattering the American forces .",

The city proper covers 49 square miles ( 127 km2 ) with an estimated population of 694,583 in 2018 , also making it the most populous city in New England . Boston is the seat of Suffolk County as well , although the county government was disbanded on July 1 , 1999 . The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston , a metropolitan statistical area ( MSA ) home to a census-estimated 4.8 million people in 2016 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country . As a combined statistical area ( CSA ) , this wider commuting region is home to some 8.2 million people , making it the sixth most populous in the United States . Boston is one of the oldest municipalities in the United States , founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from the English town of the same name . It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution , such as the Boston Massacre , the Boston Tea Party , the Battle of Bunker Hill , and the Siege of Boston . Upon gaining U.S. independence from Great Britain , it continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture . The city has expanded beyond the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation . Its rich history attracts many tourists , with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more than 20 million visitors per year . Boston 's many firsts include the United States ' first public park ( Boston Common , 1634 ) , first public or state school ( Boston Latin School , 1635 ) and first subway system ( Tremont Street Subway , 1897 ) .

  "/wiki/Battles_of_Saratoga": "The Battles of Saratoga ( September 19 and October 7 , 1777 ) marked the climax of the Saratoga campaign , giving a decisive victory to the Americans over the British in the American Revolutionary War . British General John Burgoyne led a large invasion army southward from Canada in the Champlain Valley , hoping to meet a similar British force marching northward from New York City and another British force marching eastward from Lake Ontario ; the southern and western forces never arrived , and Burgoyne was surrounded by American forces in upstate New York . He fought two small battles to break out which took place 18 days apart on the same ground , 9 miles ( 14 km ) south of Saratoga , New York . They both failed . Burgoyne found himself trapped by superior American forces with no relief , so he retreated to Saratoga ( now Schuylerville ) and surrendered his entire army there on October 17 . His surrender , says historian Edmund Morgan , was a great turning point of the war because it won for Americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory . Burgoyne 's strategy to divide New England from the southern colonies had started well but slowed due to logistical problems . He won a small tactical victory over General Horatio Gates and the Continental Army in the September 19 Battle of Freeman 's Farm at the cost of significant casualties . His gains were erased when he again attacked the Americans in the October 7 Battle of Bemis Heights and the Americans captured a portion of the British defenses . Burgoyne was therefore compelled to retreat , and his army was surrounded by the much larger American force at Saratoga , forcing him to surrender on October 17 . News of Burgoyne 's surrender was instrumental in formally bringing France into the war as an American ally , although it had previously given supplies , ammunition , and guns , notably the de Valliere cannon which played an important role in Saratoga . This battle also resulted in Spain joining France in the war against Britain .",
