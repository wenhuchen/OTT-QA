  "/wiki/Christian_martyr": "A martyr is a person who was killed because of their testimony of Jesus and God . In years of the early church , this often occurred through death by sawing , stoning , crucifixion , burning at the stake or other forms of torture and capital punishment .

Once Christians started to undergo persecution , the term came to be applied to those who suffered hardships for their faith . Finally , it was restricted to those who had been killed for their faith . The early Christian period before Constantine I was the Age of martyrs . Early Christians venerated martyrs as powerful intercessors , and their utterances were treasured as inspired by the Holy Spirit .",

Apart from his theological writings , Bonhoeffer was known for his staunch resistance to Nazi dictatorship , including vocal opposition to Hitler 's euthanasia program and genocidal persecution of the Jews . He was arrested in April 1943 by the Gestapo and imprisoned at Tegel prison for one and a half years . Later , he was transferred to Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp . After being accused of being associated with the July 20 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler , he was quickly tried , along with other accused plotters , including former members of the Abwehr ( the German Military Intelligence Office ) , and then hanged on 9 April 1945 as the Nazi regime was collapsing . 21 days later Adolf Hitler committed suicide .",

Shot in black and white to mimic old-time war movies , the film premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival on 12 May and clinched the Grand Prix . The film was initially not allowed to be shown in theaters in China for a certain period but was eventually made commercially available in China since . Inspired by the novel Survival by You Fengwei , Devils on the Doorstep is set in the last years of the Second Sino-Japanese War during World War II and tells the story of a Chinese villager who is forced by a mysterious figure to take custody of two prisoners from the Japanese Army ( Teruyuki and Yuan ) . Fearing both the mystery man and the Japanese , the village falls into a dilemma over what to do with the two prisoners . Contrary to its title , Devils on the Doorstep is not at its core an anti-Japanese war film . In Jiang 's own words , the film shows how Chinese literature and film has perpetuated an attitude of blaming the aggressor and casting the Chinese population as passive victims of aggression . Jiang hopes that the film illuminates this common human psychological trait of blaming others for disaster that goes beyond Chineseness .",

Adolf Hitler justified the invasion by the purported suffering of the ethnic Germans living in these regions . The Sudetenland annexation by Nazi Germany was detrimental to the future defense of crippled Czechslovakia as the extensive Czechoslovak border fortifications were also located in the same area . Following the Anschluss of Austria to Nazi Germany in March 1938 , the conquest and breakup of Czechoslovakia became Hitler 's next ambition . The incorporation of the Sudetenland into Germany that began on 1 October 1938 left the rest of Czechoslovakia weak , and it became powerless to resist subsequent occupation . Moreover , a small northeastern part of the borderland region known as Zaolzie was occupied and annexed to Poland ostensibly to protect the local ethnic Polish community and as a result of previous territorial claims ( Czech-Polish disputes in the years of 1918-20 ) . On 15 March 1939 , one day after the proclamation of the Slovak State the German Wehrmacht moved into the remainder of Czechoslovakia and from the Prague Castle , Hitler proclaimed the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia after the negotiations with Emil H\u00e1cha , who remained as technical head of state with the title of State President .

Following the German-Soviet non-aggression pact , Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany on 1 September 1939 and by the Soviet Union on 17 September . The campaigns ended in early October with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland . After the Axis attack on the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941 , the entirety of Poland was occupied by Germany , which proceeded to advance its racial and genocidal policies across Poland . Under the two occupations , Polish citizens suffered enormous human and material losses . According to the Institute of National Remembrance estimates , about 5.6 million Polish citizens died as a result of the German occupation and about 150,000 died as a result of the Soviet occupation . The Jews were singled out by the Germans for a quick and total annihilation and about 90% of Polish Jews ( close to three million people ) were murdered as part of the Holocaust . Jews , Poles , Romani people and prisoners of many other ethnicities were killed en masse at Nazi extermination camps , such as Auschwitz , Treblinka and Sobib\u00f3r . Ethnic Poles were subjected to both Nazi German and Soviet persecution . The Germans killed an estimated two million ethnic Poles . They had future plans to turn the remaining majority of Poles into slave labor and annihilate those perceived as undesirable as part of the wider Generalplan Ost .

  "/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials": "A precedent for trying those accused of war crimes had been set at the end of World War I in the Leipzig War Crimes Trials held in May to July 1921 before the Reichsgericht ( German Supreme Court ) in Leipzig , although these had been on a very limited scale and largely regarded as ineffectual . At the beginning of 1940 , the Polish government-in-exile asked the British and French governments to condemn the German invasion of their country . The British initially declined to do so ; however , in April 1940 , a joint declaration was issued by the British , French and Polish . Relatively bland because of Anglo-French reservations , it proclaimed the trio 's desire to make a formal and public protest to the conscience of the world against the action of the German government whom they must hold responsible for these crimes which can not remain unpunished . Three-and-a-half years later , the stated intention to punish the Germans was much more trenchant . On 1 November 1943 , the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom and the United States published their Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe , which gave a full warning that , when the Nazis were defeated , the Allies would pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth . in order that justice may be done . . The above declaration is without prejudice to the case of the major war criminals whose offences have no particular geographical location and who will be punished by a joint decision of the Government of the Allies . This intention by the Allies to dispense justice was reiterated at the Yalta Conference and at Potsdam in 1945 . British War Cabinet documents , released on 2 January 2006 , showed that as early as December 1944 the Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured . The British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , had then advocated a policy of summary execution in some circumstances , with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles , being dissuaded from this only by talks with US and Soviet leaders later in the war .",

He is best known to the general public for his mass-energy equivalence formula E = m c 2 { \\displaystyle E=mc^ { 2 } } , which has been dubbed the world 's most famous equation . He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect , a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory . Near the beginning of his career , Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field . This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern ( 1902-1909 ) . He subsequently realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields , and published a paper on general relativity in 1916 introducing his theory of gravitation . He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory , which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules . He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation , the basis of laser , which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light . In 1917 , he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe . Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895 and renounced his German citizenship in 1896 . After being stateless for more than five years , he acquired Swiss citizenship in 1901 , which he kept for the rest of his life .",

( literally : Fount of Life ) was an SS-initiated , state-supported , registered association in Nazi Germany with the goal of raising the birth rate of Aryan children of persons classified as 'racially pure ' and 'healthy ' based on Nazi racial hygiene and health ideology . Lebensborn provided welfare to its mostly unmarried mothers , encouraged anonymous births by unmarried women at their maternity homes , and mediated adoption of these children by likewise 'racially pure ' and 'healthy ' parents , particularly SS members and their families . The Cross of Honour of the German Mother was given to the women who bore the most Aryan children . Abortion was legalised by the Nazis for disabled children , but strictly punished otherwise . Initially set up in Germany in 1935 , Lebensborn expanded into several occupied European countries with Germanic populations during the Second World War . It included the selection of 'racially worthy ' orphans for adoption and care for children born from Aryan women who had been in relationships with SS members . It originally excluded children born from unions between common soldiers and foreign women , because there was no proof of 'racial purity ' on both sides . During the war , many children were kidnapped from their parents and judged by Aryan criteria for their suitability to be raised in Lebensborn homes , and fostering by German families .

The anger over these inaccuracies reached the British Parliament , where the Prime Minister , Tony Blair , agreed that the film was an affront to British sailors .

While the German term refers to any submarine , the English one ( in common with several other languages ) refers specifically to military submarines operated by Germany , particularly in the First and Second World Wars . Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships , they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role ( commerce raiding ) and enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping . The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada and other parts of the British Empire , and from the United States to the United Kingdom and ( during the Second World War ) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean .

  "/wiki/Enigma_machine": "The Enigma machine is an encryption device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial , diplomatic and military communication . It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II , in all branches of the German military . Enigma has an electromechanical rotor mechanism that scrambles the 26 letters of the alphabet . In typical use , one person enters text on the Enigma 's keyboard and another person writes down which of 26 lights above the keyboard lights up at each key press . If plain text is entered , the lit-up letters are the encoded ciphertext . Entering ciphertext transforms it back into readable plaintext . The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress . The security of the system depends on Enigma machine settings that were changed daily , based on secret key lists distributed in advance , and on other settings that change for each message . The receiving station has to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message . As used in practice , the Enigma encryption was broken from 1932 by cryptanalytic attacks from the Polish Cipher Bureau , which passed its techniques to their French and British allies in 1939 . Subsequently , a dedicated decryption centre was established by the United Kingdom at Bletchley Park as part of the Ultra program for the rest of the war . While Germany introduced a series of improvements to Enigma , and these hampered decryption efforts to varying degrees , they did not ultimately prevent Britain and its allies from exploiting Enigma-encoded messages as a major source of intelligence during the war .",

English-language speakers also use the word gulag to refer to any forced-labour camp in the Soviet Union , including camps which existed in post-Stalin times . The camps housed a wide range of convicts , from petty criminals to political prisoners . Large numbers were convicted by simplified procedures , such as by NKVD troikas or by other instruments of extrajudicial punishment . The Gulag is recognised as a major instrument of political repression in the Soviet Union . The agency was first administered by the GPU , later by the NKVD and in the final years by the Ministry of Internal Affairs ( MVD ) . The Solovki prison camp , the first corrective labor camp constructed after the revolution , was established in 1918 and legalised by a decree On the creation of the forced-labour camps on April 15 , 1919 . The internment system grew rapidly , reaching a population of 100,000 in the 1920s . According to Nicolas Werth , author of The Black Book of Communism , the yearly mortality rate in the Soviet concentration camps strongly varied , reaching 5% ( 1933 ) and 20% ( 1942-1943 ) while dropping considerably in the post-war years ( about 1 to 3% per year at the beginning of the 1950s ) . The emergent consensus among scholars who utilize official archival data is that of the 18 million who were sent to the Gulag from 1930 to 1953 , roughly 1.5 to 1.7 million perished there or as a result of their detention . However , some historians question the reliability of such data and instead rely heavily on literary sources that come to higher estimations . Archival researchers have found no plan of destruction of the gulag population and no statement of official intent to kill them , and prisoner releases vastly exceeded the number of deaths in the Gulag .",

  "/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division_(United_States)": "The 101st Airborne Division ( Screaming Eagles ) is a specialized modular light infantry division of the US Army trained for air assault operations . The Screaming Eagles has been referred to as the tip of the spear by former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and the most potent and tactically mobile of the U.S. Army 's divisions by former Chief of Staff of the Army GEN Edward C. Meyer ( ret ) . The 101st Airborne is able to plan , coordinate , and execute brigade-size air assault operations capable of seizing key terrain in support of operational objectives , and is capable of working in austere environments with limited or degraded infrastructure . These particular operations are conducted by highly mobile teams covering extensive distances and engaging enemy forces behind enemy lines . According to the author of Screaming Eagles : 101st Airborne Division , its unique battlefield mobility and high level of training have kept it in the vanguard of US land combat forces in recent conflicts . More recently , the 101st Airborne has been performing foreign internal defense and counterterrorism operations within Iraq and Afghanistan . The 101st Airborne Division has a history that is nearly a century long . During World War II , it was renowned for its role in Operation Overlord ( the D-Day landings and airborne landings on 6 June 1944 , in Normandy , France ) , Operation Market Garden , the liberation of the Netherlands and its action during the Battle of the Bulge around the city of Bastogne , Belgium . During the Vietnam War , the 101st Airborne Division fought in several major campaigns and battles , including the Battle of Hamburger Hill in May 1969 . In mid-1968 , it was reorganized and redesignated as an airmobile division and then in 1974 as an air assault division . The titles reflect the division 's shift from airplanes to helicopters as the primary method of delivering troops into combat . Many current members of the 101st are graduates of the US Army Air Assault School .",
  "/wiki/Operation_Overlord": "Operation Overlord was the codename for the Battle of Normandy , the Allied operation that launched the successful invasion of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II . The operation was launched on 6 June 1944 with the Normandy landings ( Operation Neptune , commonly known as D-Day ) . A 1,200-plane airborne assault preceded an amphibious assault involving more than 5,000 vessels . Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June , and more than two million Allied troops were in France by the end of August . The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943 . General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , and General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group , which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion . The coast of Normandy of northwestern France was chosen as the site of the invasion , with the Americans assigned to land at sectors codenamed Utah and Omaha , the British at Sword and Gold , and the Canadians at Juno . To meet the conditions expected on the Normandy beachhead , special technology was developed , including two artificial ports called Mulberry harbours and an array of specialised tanks nicknamed Hobart 's Funnies . In the months leading up to the invasion , the Allies conducted a substantial military deception , Operation Bodyguard , using both electronic and visual misinformation . This misled the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings . F\u00fchrer Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in charge of developing fortifications all along Hitler 's proclaimed Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an invasion . The Allies failed to accomplish their objectives for the first day , but gained a tenuous foothold that they gradually expanded when they captured the port at Cherbourg on 26 June and the city of Caen on 21 July .",

  "/wiki/Axis_occupation_of_Greece": "The occupation of Greece by the Axis Powers ( Greek : \u0397 \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae , I Katochi , meaning The Occupation ) began in April 1941 after Nazi Germany invaded Greece to assist its ally , Fascist Italy , which had been at war with Allied Greece since October 1940 . Following the conquest of Crete , all of Greece was occupied by June 1941 . The occupation in the mainland lasted until Germany and its ally Bulgaria were forced to withdraw under Allied pressure in early October 1944 . However , German garrisons remained in control of Crete and some other Aegean islands until after the end of World War II in Europe , surrendering these islands in May and June 1945 . Fascist Italy had initially declared war and invaded Greece in October 1940 , but the Hellenic Army initially managed to push back the invading forces into neighboring Albania , then an Italian protectorate . Nazi Germany intervened on its ally 's behalf in southern Europe . While most of the Hellenic Army was dislocated on the Albanian front to fend off the relentless Italian counter-attacks , a rapid German Blitzkrieg campaign commenced in April 1941 , and by June ( with the conquest of Crete ) Greece was defeated and occupied . The Greek government went into exile , and an Axis collaborationist puppet government was established in the country . Furthermore , Greece 's territory was divided into occupation zones run by the Axis powers , with the Germans proceeding to administer the most important regions of the country themselves , including Athens , Thessaloniki and the strategic Aegean Islands . Other regions of the country were given to Germany 's partners , Italy and Bulgaria . The occupation ruined the Greek economy and brought about terrible hardships for the Greek civilian population . Much of Greece was subjected to enormous destruction of its industry ( 80% of which was destroyed ) , infrastructure ( 28% destroyed ) , ports , roads , railways and bridges ( 90% ) , forests and other natural resources ( 25% ) and loss of civilian life ( 7.02% - 11.17% of its citizens ) .",
  "/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Acqui_Division": "The Massacre of the Acqui Division , also known as the Cephalonia Massacre , was the mass execution of the men of the Italian 33rd Infantry Division Acqui by the Germans on the island of Cephalonia , Greece , in September 1943 , following the Italian armistice during the Second World War . About 5,000 soldiers were massacred and others drowned . The Italians launched their invasion of Greece in October 1940 , but they were pushed back into Albania by November , and the Germans had to come to their aid in April 1941 . Following the decision of the Italian government to negotiate a surrender to the Allies in 1943 , the German Army tried to disarm the Italians during Operation Achse . On 13 September the Italians of the 33rd Acqui Infantry Division resisted , and fought the Germans on the island of Cephalonia . By 22 September the last of the Italian resistance surrendered after running out of ammunition . A total of 1,315 Italians were killed in the battle , 5,155 were executed by 26 September , and 3,000 were drowned when the German ships taking the survivors to concentration camps were sunk by the Allies . It was one of the largest prisoner of war massacres of the war , along with the Katyn massacre , and it was one of many atrocities committed by the 1st Mountain Division ( German : 1 .

  "/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive": "The Special Operations Executive ( SOE ) was a British World War II organisation . It was officially formed on 22 July 1940 under Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton , from the amalgamation of three existing secret organisations . Its purpose was to conduct espionage , sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe ( and later , also in occupied Southeast Asia ) against the Axis powers , and to aid local resistance movements . Few people were aware of SOE 's existence . Those who were part of it or liaised with it were sometimes referred to as the Baker Street Irregulars , after the location of its London headquarters . It was also known as Churchill 's Secret Army or the Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare . Its various branches , and sometimes the organisation as a whole , were concealed for security purposes behind names such as the Joint Technical Board or the Inter-Service Research Bureau , or fictitious branches of the Air Ministry , Admiralty or War Office . SOE operated in all territories occupied or attacked by the Axis forces , except where demarcation lines were agreed with Britain 's principal Allies ( the United States and the Soviet Union ) . It also made use of neutral territory on occasion , or made plans and preparations in case neutral countries were attacked by the Axis . The organisation directly employed or controlled more than 13,000 people , about 3,200 of whom were women . After the war , the organisation was officially dissolved on 15 January 1946 . On the wall of the west cloister of Westminster Abbey is the official memorial to all those who served in the SOE during the Second World War .",
  "/wiki/French_Resistance": "The French Resistance ( French : La R\u00e9sistance ) was the collection of French movements that fought against the Nazi German occupation of France and the collaborationist Vichy r\u00e9gime during the Second World War . Resistance cells were small groups of armed men and women ( called the Maquis in rural areas ) , who , in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities , were also publishers of underground newspapers , providers of first-hand intelligence information , and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines . The men and women of the Resistance came from all economic levels and political leanings of French society , including \u00e9migr\u00e9s , academics , students , aristocrats , conservative Roman Catholics ( including priests and nuns ) , liberals , anarchists and communists . The French Resistance played a significant role in facilitating the Allies ' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944 , and the lesser-known invasion of Provence on 15 August , by providing military intelligence on the German defences known as the Atlantic Wall and on Wehrmacht deployments and orders of battle . The Resistance also planned , coordinated , and executed acts of sabotage on the electrical power grid , transport facilities , and telecommunications networks . It was also politically and morally important to France , both during the German occupation and for decades afterward , because it provided the country with an inspiring example of the patriotic fulfillment of a national imperative , countering an existential threat to French nationhood . The actions of the Resistance stood in marked contrast to the collaboration of the French regime based at Vichy . After the landings in Normandy and Provence , the paramilitary components of the Resistance were organised more formally , into a hierarchy of operational units known , collectively , as the French Forces of the Interior ( FFI ) . Estimated to have a strength of 100,000 in June 1944 , the FFI grew rapidly and reached approximately 400,000 by October of that year . Although the amalgamation of the FFI was , in some cases , fraught with political difficulties , it was ultimately successful , and it allowed France to rebuild the fourth-largest army in the European theatre ( 1.2 million men ) by VE Day in May 1945 .",

  "/wiki/Wannsee_Conference": "The Wannsee Conference ( German : Wannseekonferenz ) was a meeting of senior government officials of Nazi Germany and Schutzstaffel ( SS ) leaders , held in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee on 20 January 1942 . The purpose of the conference , called by the director of the Reich Main Security Office SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Reinhard Heydrich , was to ensure the co-operation of administrative leaders of various government departments in the implementation of the Final solution to the Jewish question ( German : Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage ) , whereby most of the Jews of German-occupied Europe would be deported to occupied Poland and murdered . Conference participants included representatives from several government ministries , including state secretaries from the Foreign Office , the justice , interior , and state ministries , and representatives from the SS . In the course of the meeting , Heydrich outlined how European Jews would be rounded up and sent to extermination camps in the General Government ( the occupied part of Poland ) , where they would be killed . Discrimination against Jews began immediately after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933 . Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazi regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country . After the invasion of Poland in September 1939 , the extermination of European Jewry began , and the killings continued and accelerated after the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 . On 31 July 1941 , Hermann G\u00f6ring gave written authorization to Heydrich to prepare and submit a plan for a total solution of the Jewish question in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organisations . At the Wannsee Conference , Heydrich emphasised that once the deportation process was complete , the fate of the deportees would become an internal matter under the purview of the SS . A secondary goal was to arrive at a definition of who was Jewish . One copy of the Protocol with circulated minutes of the meeting survived the war . It was found by Robert Kempner in March 1947 among files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office .",
  "/wiki/Final_Solution": "The Final Solution or the Final Solution to the Jewish Question ( Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage ) was a Nazi plan for the genocide of Jews during World War II . The Final Solution to the Jewish question was the official code name for the murder of all Jews within reach , which was not restricted to the European continent . This policy of deliberate and systematic genocide starting across German-occupied Europe was formulated in procedural and geopolitical terms by Nazi leadership in January 1942 at the Wannsee Conference held near Berlin , and culminated in the Holocaust , which saw the killing of 90% of Polish Jews , and two thirds of the Jewish population of Europe . The nature and timing of the decisions that led to the Final Solution is an intensely researched and debated aspect of the Holocaust . The program evolved during the first 25 months of war leading to the attempt at murdering every last Jew in the German grasp . Most historians agree , wrote Christopher Browning , that the Final Solution can not be attributed to a single decision made at one particular point in time . It is generally accepted the decision-making process was prolonged and incremental . In 1940 , following the Fall of France , Adolf Eichmann devised the Madagascar Plan to move Europe 's Jewish population to the French colony , but the plan was abandoned for logistical reasons , mainly a naval blockade . There were also preliminary plans to deport Jews to Palestine and Siberia . In 1941 , wrote Raul Hilberg , in the first phase of the mass murder of Jews , the mobile killing units began to pursue their victims across occupied eastern territories ; in the second phase , stretching across all of German-occupied Europe , the Jewish victims were sent on death trains to centralized extermination camps built for the purpose of systematic implementation of the Final Solution .",
  "/wiki/Jewish_question": "The Jewish question ( JQ ) , also referred to as the Jewish problem , was a wide-ranging debate in 19th and 20th-century European society that pertained to the appropriate status and treatment of Jews . The debate , which was similar to other national questions , dealt with the civil , legal , national and political status of Jews as a minority within society , particularly in Europe during the 18th , 19th and 20th centuries . The debate was started within western and central European societies by politicians and writers who were influenced by the Age of Enlightenment and the ideals of the French Revolution . The debate 's issues included the legal and economic Jewish disabilities ( e.g . Jewish quotas and segregation ) , Jewish assimilation , Jewish emancipation and Jewish Enlightenment . The expression has been used by antisemitic movements from the 1880s onwards , culminating in the Nazi phrase the Final Solution to the Jewish Question . Similarly , the expression was used by proponents for and opponents of the establishment of an autonomous Jewish homeland or a sovereign Jewish state .",

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Britain": "The Battle of Britain ( German : die Luftschlacht um England , the Air Battle for England ) was a military campaign of the Second World War , in which the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) defended the United Kingdom ( UK ) against large-scale attacks by Nazi Germany 's air force , the Luftwaffe . It has been described as the first major military campaign fought entirely by air forces . The British officially recognise the battle 's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940 , which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz , that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941 . German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard the battle as a single campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941 , including the Blitz . The primary objective of the German forces was to compel Britain to agree to a negotiated peace settlement . In July 1940 , the air and sea blockade began , with the Luftwaffe mainly targeting coastal-shipping convoys , ports and shipping centres , such as Portsmouth . On 1 August , the Luftwaffe was directed to achieve air superiority over the RAF with the aim of incapacitating RAF Fighter Command ; 12 days later , it shifted the attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure . As the battle progressed , the Luftwaffe also targeted factories involved in aircraft production and strategic infrastructure . Eventually , it employed terror bombing on areas of political significance and on civilians . [ nb 9 ] The Germans had rapidly overwhelmed France and the Low Countries , leaving Britain to face the threat of invasion by sea . The German high command knew the difficulties of a seaborne attack and its impracticality while the Royal Navy controlled the English Channel and the North Sea . [ page needed ] On 16 July , Adolf Hitler ordered the preparation of Operation Sea Lion as a potential amphibious and airborne assault on Britain , to follow once the Luftwaffe had air superiority over the UK ."
