Webster left office after two terms and relocated to Boston , Massachusetts . He became a leading attorney before the Supreme Court of the United States , winning cases such as Dartmouth College v. Woodward , McCulloch v. Maryland , and Gibbons v. Ogden . Webster returned to the House in 1823 and became a key supporter of President John Quincy Adams .

  "/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison": "William Henry Harrison ( February 9 , 1773 - April 4 , 1841 ) was an American military officer and politician who served as the ninth president of the United States in 1841 . He died of typhoid , pneumonia or paratyphoid fever 31 days into his term ( the shortest tenure ) , becoming the first president to die in office . His death sparked a brief constitutional crisis regarding succession to the presidency , because the Constitution was unclear as to whether Vice President John Tyler should assume the office of president or merely execute the duties of the vacant office . Tyler claimed a constitutional mandate to become the new president and took the presidential oath of office , setting an important precedent for an orderly transfer of the presidency and its full powers when the previous president fails to complete the elected term . Harrison was born in Charles City County , Virginia , the son of Founding Father Benjamin Harrison V and the paternal grandfather of Benjamin Harrison , the 23rd president of the United States . He was the last president born as a British subject in the Thirteen Colonies before the start of the Revolutionary War in 1775 . During his early military career , he participated in the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers , an American military victory that effectively ended the Northwest Indian War . Later , he led a military force against Tecumseh 's Confederacy at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811 , where he earned the nickname Old Tippecanoe . He was promoted to major general in the Army in the War of 1812 , and in 1813 led American infantry and cavalry at the Battle of the Thames in Upper Canada . Harrison began his political career in 1798 , when he was appointed Secretary of the Northwest Territory , and in 1799 he was elected as the territory 's delegate in the House of Representatives . Two years later , President John Adams named him governor of the newly established Indiana Territory , a post he held until 1812 . After the War of 1812 , he moved to Ohio where he was elected to represent the state 's 1st district in the House in 1816 .",

  "/wiki/Maine_Supreme_Judicial_Court": "The Maine Supreme Judicial Court is the highest court in the state of Maine 's judicial system . It is composed of seven justices , who are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Maine Senate . From 1820 until 1839 , justices served lifetime appointments with a mandatory retirement age of 70 . Beginning in 1839 , justices are appointed for seven-year terms , with no limit on the number of terms that they may serve . Known as the Law Court when sitting as an appellate court , the Supreme Court 's other functions include hearing appeals of sentences longer than one year of incarceration , overseeing admission to the bar and the conduct of its members , and promulgating rules for all the state 's courts . The Maine Supreme Judicial Court is one of the few state supreme courts in the United States authorized to issue advisory opinions , which it does upon request by the governor or legislature , as set out in the Maine Constitution . It is also unusual for a state 's highest appellate court in that its primary location is not that of the state 's capital city , Augusta , partially because the Kennebec County Courthouse did not have a courtroom large enough for the Supreme Court 's proceedings . The court did meet there from 1830 until 1970 , when it permanently moved to the Cumberland County Courthouse . The renovation of the Kennebec County Courthouse in 2015 , which included expansion of the bench in its largest courtroom to permit all 7 MSJC justices to sit there , will allow the court to meet there at least twice a year . It will also continue to meet in Portland , Bangor , and at high schools around the state . The MSJC is also authorized to rule on the fitness of the Governor of Maine to serve in office , which it does upon the Maine Secretary of State certifying to the court that the governor is temporarily unable to carry out the duties of that office . The court must then hold a hearing and , if it agrees that the governor is unfit , declare the office of governor temporarily vacant and transfer its duties to the President of the Maine Senate , who would serve as acting governor .",
