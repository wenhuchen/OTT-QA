It is at the center of the Northeast Corridor , a passenger rail line that connects New York City with Boston , Philadelphia , Washington , D.C. , and intermediate points . Intercity trains are operated by Amtrak , which owns the station , while commuter rail services are operated by the Long Island Rail Road ( LIRR ) and NJ Transit ( NJT ) . Connections are available within the complex to the New York City Subway , and buses . An underground passageway formerly provided an indoor connection with the 34th Street-Herald Square subway station and 33rd Street PATH station . Penn Station is named for the Pennsylvania Railroad ( PRR ) , its builder and original tenant , and shares its name with several stations in other cities . The current facility is the remodeled underground remnant of the original Pennsylvania Station , a more ornate station building designed by McKim , Mead , and White and considered a masterpiece of the Beaux-Arts style . Completed in 1910 , it enabled direct rail access to New York City from the south for the first time . Its head house was torn down in 1963 , galvanizing the modern historic preservation movement .",

Manhattan serves as the city 's economic and administrative center , cultural identifier , and historical birthplace . The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island , bounded by the Hudson , East , and Harlem rivers ; as well as several small adjacent islands . Manhattan additionally contains Marble Hill , a small neighborhood now on the U.S. mainland , that was connected using landfill to the Bronx and separated from the rest of Manhattan by the Harlem River .

  "/wiki/Port_Authority_Trans-Hudson": "Port Authority Trans-Hudson ( PATH ) is a 13.8-mile ( 22.2 km ) rapid transit system in the northeastern New Jersey cities of Newark , Harrison , Jersey City , and Hoboken , and Lower and Midtown Manhattan in New York City . It is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . PATH trains run around the clock year round ; four routes serving 13 stations operate during the daytime on weekdays , while two routes operate during weekends , late nights , and holidays . Its tracks cross the Hudson River through century-old cast iron tubes that rest on the river bottom under a thin layer of silt . It operates as a deep-level subway in Manhattan and the Jersey City/Hoboken riverfront ; from Grove Street in Jersey City to Newark , trains run in open cuts , at grade level , and on elevated track . The routes of the PATH system were originally operated by the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad ( H & M ) , built to link New Jersey 's Hudson Waterfront with New York City . The system began operations in 1908 and was fully built out in 1911 . Three stations have since closed ; two others were re-located after a re-alignment of the western terminus . From the 1920s , the rise of automobile travel and the concurrent construction of bridges and tunnels across the river sent the H & M into a financial decline from which it never recovered , and it was forced into bankruptcy in 1954 . As part of the deal that cleared the way for the construction of the original World Trade Center , the Port Authority bought the H & M out of receivership in 1962 and renamed it PATH . In the 2000s and 2010s the system suffered considerably from disasters that affected the region , most notably the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Sandy . Both private and public stakeholders have proposed expanding PATH service in New Jersey , and construction on an extension to Newark Liberty International Airport is projected to start in 2020 .",

New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous , with 9 million residents as of 2017 and an area of 8,722.58 square miles , making it the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states , with its biggest city being Newark . New Jersey lies completely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia . New Jersey was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017 . New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years , with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast . In the early 17th century , the Dutch and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state . The English later seized control of the region , naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands , Jersey , and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley , 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton . New Jersey was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century . In the 19th century , factories in the cities Camden , Paterson , Newark , Trenton , Jersey City , and Elizabeth ( known as the Big Six ) , helped drive the Industrial Revolution . New Jersey 's geographic location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis , between Boston and New York City to the northeast , and Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Washington , D.C. , to the southwest , fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century . At the turn of the 21st century , this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of New Jersey 's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state , with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008 .",

Its capital is Hartford and its most populous city is Bridgeport . It is part of New England , although portions of it are often grouped with New York and New Jersey as the tri-state area . The state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the state . The word Connecticut is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for long tidal river . Connecticut 's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small , short-lived settlement called Fort Hoop in Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers . Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony New Netherland , which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers , although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English . Thomas Hooker led a band of followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony ; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony . The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders , considered the first constitutions in America . In 1662 , the three colonies were merged under a royal charter , making Connecticut a crown colony .",
