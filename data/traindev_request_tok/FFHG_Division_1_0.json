Although Nantes was the primary residence of the 15th-century dukes of Brittany , Rennes became the provincial capital after the 1532 union of Brittany and France . During the 17th century , after the establishment of the French colonial empire , Nantes gradually became the largest port in France and was responsible for nearly half of the 18th-century French Atlantic slave trade . The French Revolution resulted in an economic decline , but Nantes developed robust industries after 1850 ( chiefly in shipbuilding and food processing ) . Deindustrialisation in the second half of the 20th century spurred the city to adopt a service economy .
