Census and ridership data show that Miami has the highest public transportation usage of any city in Florida , as about 17% of Miamians use public transportation on a regular basis , compared to about 4% of commuters in the South Florida metropolitan area . The majority of public transportation in Miami is operated by Miami-Dade Transit ( MDT ) , which is currently the largest transit system in Florida and was the 14th largest transit system in the United States in 2011 . South Florida is one of the most densely populated urbanized areas in the United States overall , [ b ] being bound by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the South Florida Water Management District and the Everglades to the west , with a fairly strict Urban Development Boundary ( UDB ) . As of the 2010 US Census , South Florida is both the eighth most populous and eighth most densely populated metropolitan area in the United States . Now , with a population of over five and a half million people living in an urbanized area of only 1,116.1 sq mi ( 2,891 km2 ) , it has an average population density of over 5,000 residents per square mile .

A major problem for urban planning and effective public transit in Miami-Dade and South Florida is the fact that in terms of planning , it is one of the most sprawled out and automobile dependent metropolitan areas in the United States , [ b ] with a lot of lowly contrasted medium density development spread throughout the area . For example , a very low percentage of the area 's office space is located in the Central Business District ( CBD ) of Miami ( only 13% , the lowest in the nation , in 1999 ) . Additionally , there has been very little transit-oriented development ( TOD ) . Subsequently , transit access between people and jobs in the city and region remains limited .",
