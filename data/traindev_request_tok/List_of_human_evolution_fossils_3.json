  "/wiki/Human": "Humans ( Homo sapiens ) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina . Together with chimpanzees , gorillas , and orangutans , they are part of the family Hominidae ( the great apes , or hominids ) . Terrestrial animals , humans are characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion ; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals ; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications ; larger , more complex brains than other animals ; and highly advanced and organized societies . Early hominins - particularly the australopithecines , whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes - are less often referred to as human than hominins of the genus Homo . Several of these hominins used fire , occupied much of Eurasia , and the lineage that gave rise to Homo sapiens is thought to have diverged in Africa around 500,000 years ago , with the earliest fossil evidence of evidence of early Homo sapiens appearing ( also in Africa ) around 300,000 years ago . The oldest early H. sapiens fossils were found in Jebel Irhoud , Morocco dating to about 315,000 years ago . Discovered in 1967 , Omo-Kibish I ( Omo I ) from southern Ethiopia is , as of 2017 [ update ] , the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known ( 196 \u00b1 5 ka ) . Humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity at least by about 100,000-70,000 years ago and ( according to recent evidence ) as far back as around 300,000 years ago , in the Middle Stone Age , with some features of behavioral modernity possibly beginning earlier , and possibly in parallel with evolutionary brain globularization in H. sapiens . In several waves of migration , H. sapiens ventured out of Africa and populated most of the world . The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected much of the biosphere and millions of species worldwide . Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a larger brain with a well-developed neocortex , prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes , which enable advanced abstract reasoning , language , problem solving , sociality , and culture through social learning . Humans use tools more frequently and effectively than any other animal : they are the only extant species to build fires , cook food , clothe themselves , and create and use numerous other technologies and arts .",

It has since become widely known as Samu , a Hungarian short form of the name . Hungarian anthropologist Andor Thoma ( 1928-2003 ) initially described it as Homo erectus seu sapiens paleohungaricus . The fossil at the time was believed to be about 500,000 years old , and some literature of the 1970s classifies it as Homo erectus . Analyses performed in the 1990s have revealed a significantly younger age , at between 250,000 and 300,000 years old ( Mindel glaciation ) , and the fossil is now classified as Homo heidelbergensis .

The derivation of H. sapiens from H. rhodesiensis has often been proposed , but is obscured by a fossil gap from 400-260 kya . [ note 3 ] The species was originally named Homo heidelbergensis due to the skeleton 's first discovery near Heidelberg , Germany . The first discovery - a mandible - was made in 1907 by Otto Schoetensack . The skulls of this species share features with both H. erectus and modern humans ; its brain was nearly as large as that of modern humans . The Sima de los Huesos cave at Atapuerca in northern Spain holds particularly rich layers of deposits where excavations were still in progress as of 2018 . H. heidelbergensis was dispersed throughout Eastern and Southern Africa ( Ethiopia , Namibia , Southern Africa ) as well as Europe ( England , France , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Italy , Portugal , Spain ) . Its exact relation both to the earlier H. antecessor and H. ergaster , and to the later species Neanderthals , Denisovans , and modern humans is unclear . Modern humans have been proposed to derive from H. heidelbergensis via H. rhodesiensis , present in East and North Africa from around 400 kya . The correct assignment of many fossils to a particular chronospecies is difficult and often differences in opinion ensue among paleoanthropologists due to the absence of universally accepted dividing lines ( autapomorphies ) between H. erectus , H. heidelbergensis , and Neanderthals . It is uncertain whether H. heidelbergensis is ancestral to modern humans , as a fossil gap in Africa between 400-260 thousand years ago obscures the presumed derivation of H. sapiens from H .",

They were located in a gravel pit about 2.5 km before the Aniene merges into the Tiber river . The first skull was discovered in 1929 , and appears to be that of an adult female . The second was found in 1935 by Professors Breuil and Blanc , and forms part of the face of possibly a 35-year-old male . Both specimens appear to be Neanderthal , but display characteristics that differed from classical Neanderthal skulls . The skulls were originally kept at the Institute of Anthropology of the University of Rome , then under the direction of Professor Sergio Sergi . During World War II he kept them hidden to preserve them from German officers seeking fossil treasures . When Professor Sergi retired as the director , the skulls went into his personal possession . In 2015 , the fossils were re-dated and found to be much earlier than previously thought . The new study concludes that the fossils should be dated to around 250,000 years ago , pushing back the age of the fossils by over 100,000 years and thus surpassing Altamura Man as the earliest evidence for Neanderthals in Italy . The new study was a collaborative effort conducted by geologists from the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology working in collaboration with anthropologists and paleontologists from Sapienza University and the University of Wisconsin .

The time of divergence of Neanderthals from their ancestor H. heidelbergensis is also unclear . The oldest potential Neanderthal bones are dated to 430 kya , but the classification is uncertain . Neanderthals are known from numerous fossils , especially from after 130 kya . The type specimen , Neanderthal 1 , was found in 1856 in the German Neander Valley . After much debate over their validity , Neanderthals were depicted as being primitive , stupid , and brutish for much of the early 20th century . Though knowledge and perception of them has markedly changed since then in the scientific community , the image of the unevolved caveman archetype remains prevalent in popular culture . Compared to modern humans , Neanderthals were stockier , with somewhat shorter limbs and a larger chest and nose . These features are often explained as adaptations to conserve heat in a cold climate , but ( aside from body fat storage ) they are more likely products of genetic drift and adaptations for sprinting in the warmer , forested landscape that Neanderthals often inhabited .

Situated on the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula , Greece is located at the crossroads of Europe , Asia , and Africa . It shares land borders with Albania to the northwest , North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north , and Turkey to the northeast . The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland , the Ionian Sea to the west , the Cretan Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to the south . Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at 13,676 km ( 8,498 mi ) in length , featuring many islands , of which 227 are inhabited . Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous , with Mount Olympus being the highest peak at 2,918 metres ( 9,573 ft ) . The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions : Macedonia , Central Greece , the Peloponnese , Thessaly , Epirus , the Aegean Islands ( including the Dodecanese and Cyclades ) , Thrace , Crete , and the Ionian Islands . Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilisation , being the birthplace of democracy , Western philosophy , Western literature , historiography , political science , major scientific and mathematical principles , Western drama and the Olympic Games . From the eighth century B.C. , the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states , known as poleis ( singular polis ) , which spanned the entire Mediterranean region and the Black Sea . Philip of Macedon united most of the Greek mainland in the fourth century BC , with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world , from the eastern Mediterranean to India .

With over 109 million inhabitants , Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world and the second-most populous nation on the African continent with a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres ( 420,000 sq mi ) . Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa , which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the Nubian and Somali tectonic plates . Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia . It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era . Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BCE , Ethiopia 's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history . Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba , under its first king , Menelik I . In the first centuries , the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region , followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137 . During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa , Ethiopia and Liberia were two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power and many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours . However , the country was later occupied by Italy in 1936 and became Italian Ethiopia ( part of Italian East Africa ) until it was liberated during World War II .",

The recognition of H. s. idaltu as a valid subspecies of the anatomically modern human lineage would justify the description of contemporary humans with the subspecies name H. s. sapiens , though physical anthropologist Chris Stringer does not consider idaltu distinct enough within H. sapiens to warrant its own subspecies designation , and instead classifies it simply as anatomically modern H. sapiens .

Denisovans are known from few remains , and , consequently , most of what is known about them comes from DNA evidence . Pending consensus on their taxonomic status , they have been referred to as Homo denisova , H. altaiensis , or H. sapiens denisova . The first Denisovan individual was identified in 2010 based on mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) extracted from a juvenile female finger bone from the Siberian Denisova Cave . Nuclear DNA ( nDNA ) indicates close affinities with Neanderthals . The cave was also periodically inhabited by Neanderthals , but it is unclear whether they ever cohabited in the cave . Additional specimens from Denisova Cave were subsequently discovered , as was a single specimen from the Baishiya Karst Cave on the Tibetan Plateau in China . This indicates they lived in a wide variety of habitats , including forests , tundras , mountains , and jungles . DNA evidence suggests they had dark skin , eyes , and hair ; and had a Neanderthal-like build and facial features , but had larger molars which are reminiscent of Middle Pleistocene to Late Pleistocene archaic humans and australopithecines . Denisovans apparently interbred with modern humans , with about 3-5% of the DNA of Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians and around 6% in Papuans deriving from Denisovans .

Following the rise of Homo erectus 1.8 million years ago , humanity spread all over the Old World , and later in the New World and Australia under the species Homo sapiens . Homo sapiens also overtook Africa and absorbed the older archaic species and subspecies of humanity . One of the oldest known ethnic groups still existing , the Hadzabe , appears to have originated in Tanzania , and their oral history recalls ancestors who were tall and were the first to use fire , medicine , and lived in caves , much like Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis who lived in the same region before them . Later in the Stone and Bronze Age , prehistoric migrations into Tanzania included Southern Cushitic speakers who moved south from present-day Ethiopia ; Eastern Cushitic people who moved into Tanzania from north of Lake Turkana about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago ; and the Southern Nilotes , including the Datoog , who originated from the present-day South Sudan-Ethiopia border region between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago . : page 18 These movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of the Mashariki Bantu from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas .
