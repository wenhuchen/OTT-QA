  "/wiki/Serial_killing": "A serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people , usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification , with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant period of time between them . Different authorities apply different criteria when designating serial killers . For example , while most authorities set a threshold of three murders , others extend it to four or lessen it to two . The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines serial killing as a series of two or more murders , committed as separate events , usually , but not always , by one offender acting alone . Although psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing , and most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim , the FBI states that the motives of serial killers can include anger , thrill-seeking , financial gain , and attention seeking . The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion . The victims may have something in common , for example , demographic profile , appearance , gender or race . A serial killer is neither a mass murderer , nor a spree killer , although there may be conceptual overlaps between serial killers and spree killers .",

  "/wiki/Glaswegian": "The speech of Glaswegians , popularly known as the Glasgow patter or Glaswegian , varies from Scottish English at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum , with the local dialect of West Central Scots at the other . Therefore , the speech of many Glaswegians can draw on a continuum between fully localised and fully standardised . Additionally , the Glasgow dialect has Highland English and Hiberno-English influences owing to the speech of Highlanders and Irish people who migrated in large numbers to the Glasgow area in the 19th and early 20th centuries . The Glasgow vernacular also exerts considerable influence on the vernacular of the surrounding towns . As with other dialects , the Patter is subject to dialect levelling where particularly Scots vocabulary is replaced by Standard English words and , in particular , words largely from colloquial English .

The word autobiography was first used deprecatingly by William Taylor in 1797 in the English periodical The Monthly Review , when he suggested the word as a hybrid , but condemned it as pedantic . However , its next recorded use was in its present sense , by Robert Southey in 1809 . Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century , first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity . Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that [ autobiography ] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time , while the diary , however reflective it may be , moves through a series of moments in time . Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer 's life from the moment of composition . While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints , autobiography may be based entirely on the writer 's memory . The memoir form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends , as Pascal claims , to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer 's review of his or her life .",

  "/wiki/Whole-life_tariff": "In England and Wales , life imprisonment is a sentence which lasts until the death of the prisoner , although in most cases the prisoner will be eligible for parole ( officially termed early release ) after a fixed period set by the judge . This period is known as the minimum term ( previously known as the whole life tariff ) , usually a few years . In some exceptionally grave cases , however , a judge may order that a life sentence should mean life by making a whole life order . Murder has carried a mandatory life sentence in England and Wales since capital punishment was suspended in 1965 . There is currently no first degree or second degree definition . However , there were two degrees of murder between 1957 and 1965 , one carrying the death penalty and one life imprisonment . Life imprisonment is only applicable to defendants aged 21 or over . Those aged between 18 and 20 are sentenced to custody for life . Those aged under 18 are sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure for murder , or detention for life for other crimes where life imprisonment is the sentence for adults ; however , regardless of age all defendants including those under 18 sentenced to a life sentence can theoretically be held in custody for their whole life if required and a life sentence can only end if quashed by a judge or the person serving the sentence dies . In addition to the sentences mentioned above , until 2012 there were two other kinds of life sentence , imprisonment for public protection ( for those over 18 ) and detention for public protection ( for those under 18 ) . These were for defendants whose crimes were not serious enough to merit a normal life sentence , but who were considered a danger to the public and so should not be released until the Parole Board had decided that they no longer represented a risk . These sentences were abolished by the Legal Aid , Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 , although a number of prisoners remain imprisoned under the former legislation .",

  "/wiki/Jeremy_Bamber": "Jeremy Nevill Bamber ( born Jeremy Paul Marsham ; 13 January 1961 ) is an Englishman who was convicted of the White House Farm murders . He was found guilty in October 1986 of the August 1985 shooting of his parents , his sister , and his sister 's six-year-old twin sons at his parents ' farmhouse in Essex . Returning a majority verdict , the jury found that , after committing the murders to secure a large inheritance , Bamber had placed the rifle in the hands of his 28-year-old sister , who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia , to make the scene appear to be a murder-suicide . Bamber is serving life imprisonment without the possibility of parole . As of November 2016 he was one of 70 prisoners in the UK subject to a whole-life order , and is the only such prisoner to assert his innocence . Bamber has repeatedly applied unsuccessfully to have his conviction overturned or his whole life tariff removed ; his extended family remain convinced of his guilt . The Criminal Cases Review Commission ( CCRC ) referred the case to the Court of Appeal in 2001 , which upheld the conviction in 2002 . The Court of Appeal ordered full disclosure of evidence to the defence , but this did not take place . The appeal was rejected and the CCRC rejected further applications from Bamber in 2004 and 2012 , having not identified any new evidence or legal argument capable of raising a real possibility that the court of appeal would quash the conviction . In December 2019 Bamber 's lawyers made a further application for the disclosure of withheld evidence in relation to Bamber 's phone call to the police on the night of the killings and a silencer .",

It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres ( 103,500 sq mi ) . New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal , fungal , and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland . Sometime between 1250 and 1300 , Polynesians settled in the islands and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands .

  "/wiki/Colin_Ireland": "Colin Ireland ( 16 March 1954 - 21 February 2012 ) was a British serial killer known as the Gay Slayer because his victims were homosexual . Criminologist David Wilson believes that Ireland was a psychopath . Ireland suffered a severely dysfunctional upbringing . He committed various crimes from the age of 16 and had served time in borstals and prisons . While living in Southend , he started frequenting the Coleherne pub , a gay pub in Earl 's Court . Ireland sought men who liked the passive role and sadomasochism , so he could readily restrain them as they initially believed it was a sexual game . Ireland said he was heterosexual : he had been twice married to women , and that he pretended to be gay only to befriend potential victims . Ireland claimed that his murders were not sexually motivated . He was highly organised , and carried a full murder kit of rope and handcuffs and a full change of clothes to each murder . After killing his victim he cleaned the flat of any forensic evidence linking him to the scene and stayed in the flat until morning in order to avoid arousing suspicion from leaving in the middle of the night . He was jailed for life for the murders in December 1993 and remained imprisoned until his death in February 2012 , at the age of 57 .",
