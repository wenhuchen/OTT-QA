The film was directed by Louis J. Gasnier and featured a cast of mainly little-known actors .

But soon after the film was shot , it was purchased by producer Dwain Esper , who re-cut the film for distribution on the exploitation film circuit , exploiting vulgar interest while escaping censorship under the guise of moral guidance , beginning in 1938-1939 through the 1940s and 1950s .

  "/wiki/The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre [ note 1 ] is a 1974 American slasher film directed by Tobe Hooper and written and co-produced by Hooper and Kim Henkel . It stars Marilyn Burns , Paul A. Partain , Edwin Neal , Jim Siedow and Gunnar Hansen , who respectively portray Sally Hardesty , Franklin Hardesty , the hitchhiker , the proprietor , and Leatherface . The film follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead . The film was marketed as being based on true events to attract a wider audience and to act as a subtle commentary on the era 's political climate ; although the character of Leatherface and minor story details were inspired by the crimes of murderer Ed Gein , its plot is largely fictional . Hooper produced the film for less than $ 140,000 ( $ 700,000 adjusted for inflation ) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas , where the film was shot . The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week , so that he could finish as quickly as possible and reduce equipment rental costs . Due to the film 's violent content , Hooper struggled to find a distributor , but it was eventually aqcuired by Louis Perano of Bryanston Distributing Company . Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating , but the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally . The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was banned in several countries , and numerous theaters stopped showing the film in response to complaints about its violence . While it initially drew a mixed reception from critics , it was highly profitable , grossing over $ 30 million at the domestic box office , equivalent with roughly over $ 150.8 million as of 2019 , selling over 16.5 million tickets in 1974 . It has since gained a reputation as one of the best and most influential horror films . It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre , including the use of power tools as murder weapons , the characterization of the killer as a large , hulking , faceless figure , and the killing of victims .",
