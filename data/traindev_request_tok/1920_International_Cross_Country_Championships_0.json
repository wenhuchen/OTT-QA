  "/wiki/James_Wilson_(athlete)": "James Wilson ( 2 October 1891 - 1973 ) was a Scottish long-distance runner who specialised in the 10,000 metres . He competed for Great Britain at the 1920 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal in the 10,000 metres , five seconds behind Paavo Nurmi ; Wilson beat Nurmi by some 5 seconds in the heats . He finished fourth in the individual 8,000 m cross-country race , again behind Nurmi , but won a silver medal with the British team . Nationally Wilson won Scottish titles over 4 miles in 1914-20 and over 10 miles in 1920 . James and his twin brother John were the youngest of five children of Isabella and Robert Wilson , Scottish migrant workers in England . His father was a herdsman from Aberdeenshire . James and John were inspired to join the local athletics club by watching the 1908 Olympic marathon race that passed nearby their home . Later , when World War I broke out , John enlisted to the army and died from peritonitis in 1916 , while James stayed at home earning his living as a metalworker . After the 1920 Olympics he found a job as mechanical engineer at the Neasden Power Station , which provided electricity to the Metropolitan Railways , and semi-retired from running . He resumed competing in 1923 , when he joined Surrey Athletic Club , but never regained his past shape and retired for good in 1925 . Wilson was married to Annie Williams . He died from a bowel cancer aged 81-82 .",
  "/wiki/Scotland": "Scotland ( Scots : Scotland , Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain , with a border with England to the southeast , and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west , the North Sea to the northeast , the Irish Sea to the south , and more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the European Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became king of England and Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . In 1801 , Great Britain entered into a political union with Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( in 1922 , the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927 ) . Within Scotland , the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland . The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland ; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England . In 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re-established , in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister of Scotland , who is supported by the deputy first minister of Scotland .",

  "/wiki/England": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north . The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain , which lies in the North Atlantic , and includes over 100 smaller islands , such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight . It is the largest country of British Isles . The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , a Germanic tribe deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula , who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law - the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world - developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation . England 's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north ( for example , the Lake District and Pennines ) and in the west ( for example , Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills ) .",

It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel , the Irish Sea , and St George 's Channel . Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles , the third-largest in Europe , and the twentieth-largest on Earth . Geopolitically , Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland ( officially named Ireland ) , which covers five-sixths of the island , and Northern Ireland , which is part of the United Kingdom . In 2011 , the population of Ireland was about 6.6 million , ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain . As of 2016 , 4.8 million live in the Republic of Ireland , and 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland . The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain , with several navigable rivers extending inland . Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature . Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages . Today , woodland makes up about 10% of the island , compared with a European average of over 33% , and most of it is non-native conifer plantations . There are twenty-six extant land mammal species native to Ireland . The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate , and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area , although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe .",

Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia . West Francia , which became the Kingdom of France in 987 , emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , following its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) .",
