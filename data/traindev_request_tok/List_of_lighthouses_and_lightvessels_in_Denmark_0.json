The Baltic Sea drains into the Kattegat through the Danish Straits . The sea area is a continuation of the Skagerrak and may be seen as a bay of the Baltic Sea or the North Sea or , as in traditional Scandinavian usage , neither of these . The Kattegat is a rather shallow sea and can be very difficult and dangerous to navigate because of the many sandy and stony reefs and tricky currents , which often shift . In modern times , artificial seabed channels have been dug , many reefs have been dredged by either sand pumping or stone fishing , and a well-developed light signaling network has been installed , to safeguard the very heavy international traffic of this small sea . There are several large cities and major ports in the Kattegat , including Gothenburg , Aarhus , Aalborg , Halmstad and Frederikshavn , mentioned by descending size .",

Tourism is also important during the summer months . The island is home to an especially large number of Denmark 's round churches . The island is known as solskins\u00f8en ( Sunshine Island ) because of its weather and klippe\u00f8en ( Rock Island ) because of its geology , which consists of granite , except along the southern coast . The heat from the summer is stored in the rock formations and the weather is quite warm until October . As a result of the climate , a local variety of the common fig , known as Bornholm 's Diamond , can grow locally on the island . The island 's topography consists of dramatic rock formations in the north ( unlike the rest of Denmark , which is mostly gentle rolling hills ) sloping down towards pine and deciduous forests ( greatly affected by storms in the 1950s ) , farmland in the middle and sandy beaches in the south .
