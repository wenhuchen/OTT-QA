  "/wiki/Diameter": "In geometry , a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle . It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle . Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere . In more modern usage , the length of a diameter is also called the diameter . In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter ( which refers to the line segment itself ) , because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length , this being twice the radius r .",
  "/wiki/99942_Apophis": "99942 Apophis ( /\u0259\u02c8p\u0252f\u026as/ , previously known by its provisional designation 2004 MN4 ) is a near-Earth asteroid with a diameter of 370 metres that caused a brief period of concern in December 2004 because initial observations indicated a probability of up to 2.7% that it would hit Earth on April 13 , 2029 . Additional observations provided improved predictions that eliminated the possibility of an impact on Earth or the Moon in 2029 . However , until 2006 , a possibility remained that during the 2029 close encounter with Earth , Apophis would pass through a gravitational keyhole , a small region no more than about 800 metres ( 1\u20442 mi ) in diameter , that would set up a future impact exactly seven years later on April 13 , 2036 . This possibility kept it at Level 1 on the Torino impact hazard scale until August 2006 , when the probability that Apophis would pass through the keyhole was determined to be very small and Apophis 's rating on the Torino scale was lowered to zero . By 2008 , the keyhole had been determined to be less than 1 km wide . During the short time when it had been of greatest concern , Apophis set the record for highest rating on the Torino scale , reaching level 4 on December 27 , 2004 . As of 2014 , the diameter of Apophis is estimated to be approximately 370 metres ( 1,210 ft ) . Preliminary observations by Goldstone radar in January 2013 effectively ruled out the possibility of an Earth impact by Apophis in 2036 . By May 6 , 2013 ( April 15 , 2013 observation arc ) , the probability of an impact on April 13 , 2036 had been eliminated . Using observations through February 26 , 2014 , the odds of an impact on April 12 , 2068 , as calculated by the JPL Sentry risk table are 1 in 150,000 . As of October 2019 [ update ] , there were two asteroids with a more notable cumulative Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale than Apophis , though none of them have a Torino level greater than 0 . On average , one asteroid the size of Apophis ( 370 metres ) can be expected to impact Earth once in about 80,000 years .",

  "/wiki/Trojan_asteroids": "In astronomy , a trojan is a small celestial body that shares the orbit of a larger one , remaining in a stable orbit approximately 60\u00b0 ahead or behind the main body near one of its Lagrangian points L4 and L5 . Trojans can share the orbits of planets or of large moons . Trojans are one type of co-orbital object . In this arrangement , a star and a planet orbit about their common barycenter , which is close to the center of the star because it is usually much more massive than the orbiting planet . In turn , a much smaller mass than both the star and the planet , located at one of the Lagrangian points of the star-planet system , is subject to a combined gravitational force that acts through this barycenter . Hence the smallest object orbits around the barycenter with the same orbital period as the planet , and the arrangement can remain stable over time . In the Solar System , most known trojans share the orbit of Jupiter . They are divided into the Greek camp at L4 ( ahead of Jupiter ) and the Trojan camp at L5 ( trailing Jupiter ) . More than a million Jupiter trojans larger than one kilometer are thought to exist , of which more than 7,000 are currently catalogued . Only nine Mars trojans , 22 Neptune trojans , two Uranus trojans , and a single Earth trojan , have been found to date . A temporary Venus Trojan is also known . Numerical orbital dynamics stability simulations indicate that Saturn and Uranus probably do not have any primordial trojans .",

  "/wiki/Solar_sail": "Solar sails ( also called light sails or photon sails ) are a method of spacecraft propulsion using radiation pressure exerted by sunlight on large mirrors . Based on the physics , a number of spaceflight missions to test solar propulsion and navigation have been proposed since the 1980s . A useful analogy to solar sailing may be a sailing boat ; the light exerting a force on the mirrors is akin to a sail being blown by the wind . High-energy laser beams could be used as an alternative light source to exert much greater force than would be possible using sunlight , a concept known as beam sailing . Solar sail craft offer the possibility of low-cost operations combined with long operating lifetimes . Since they have few moving parts and use no propellant , they can potentially be used numerous times for delivery of payloads . Solar sails use a phenomenon that has a proven , measured effect on aerodynamics . Solar pressure affects all spacecraft , whether in interplanetary space or in orbit around a planet or small body . A typical spacecraft going to Mars , for example , will be displaced thousands of kilometers by solar pressure , so the effects must be accounted for in trajectory planning , which has been done since the time of the earliest interplanetary spacecraft of the 1960s . Solar pressure also affects the orientation of a spacecraft , a factor that must be included in spacecraft design . The total force exerted on an 800 by 800 meter solar sail , for example , is about 5 newtons ( 1.1 lbf ) at Earth 's distance from the Sun , making it a low-thrust propulsion system , similar to spacecraft propelled by electric engines , but as it uses no propellant , that force is exerted almost constantly and the collective effect over time is great enough to be considered a potential manner of propelling spacecraft .",
  "/wiki/2_Pallas": "Pallas [ d ] ( minor-planet designation : 2 Pallas ) is the second asteroid to have been discovered ( after Ceres ) , and is one of the largest asteroids in the Solar System .

It is 512 kilometers ( 318 mi ) in diameter , somewhat smaller than 4 Vesta . It is likely a remnant protoplanet . When Pallas was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers on 28 March 1802 , it was counted as a planet , as were other asteroids in the early 19th century . The discovery of many more asteroids after 1845 eventually led to their reclassification . Pallas 's surface is most likely composed of a silicate material ; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites . With an orbital inclination of 34.8\u00b0 , Pallas 's orbit is unusually highly inclined to the plane of the asteroid belt , and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto , making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft . It was considered as a potential planet in 2006 , but it has since been determined that its shape departs significantly from an ellipsoid .",
