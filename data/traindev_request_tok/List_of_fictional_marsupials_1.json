  "/wiki/Koala": "The koala ( Phascolarctos cinereus , or , inaccurately , koala bear [ a ] ) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia . It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats , which comprise the family Vombatidae . The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland 's eastern and southern regions , inhabiting Queensland , New South Wales , Victoria , and South Australia . It is easily recognisable by its stout , tailless body and large head with round , fluffy ears and large , spoon-shaped nose . The koala has a body length of 60-85 cm ( 24-33 in ) and weighs 4-15 kg ( 9-33 lb ) . Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown . Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south . These populations possibly are separate subspecies , but this is disputed . Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands , and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet . Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content , koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day . They are asocial animals , and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring . Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates .",
  "/wiki/Kangaroo": "The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae ( macropods , meaning large foot ) . In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family , especially those of the genus Macropus : the red kangaroo , antilopine kangaroo , eastern grey kangaroo , and western grey kangaroo . Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia . The Australian government estimates that 34.3 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2011 , up from 25.1 million one year earlier . As with the terms wallaroo and wallaby , kangaroo refers to a paraphyletic grouping of species . All three refer to members of the same taxonomic family , Macropodidae , and are distinguished according to size . The largest species in the family are called kangaroos and the smallest are generally called wallabies . The term wallaroos refers to species of an intermediate size . There is also the tree-kangaroo , another genus of macropod , which inhabits the tropical rainforests of New Guinea , far northeastern Queensland and some of the islands in the region . A general idea of the relative size of these informal terms could be :",
