Its last known eruption is believed to have occurred around 550 A.D. With a peak elevation of 6,263 m ( 20,548 ft ) , Chimborazo is the highest mountain in Ecuador . Chimborazos summit is also the farthest point on the Earths surface from the Earths center given that it is located along the planets equatorial bulge . Chimborazos summit , therefore , is at a higher point than the summit of Mount Everest which is measured from sea level . Despite this , it is only the 39th highest peak in its own range . Like Everest , Chimborazo is also known for climbing , but Chimborazos climb demands skill , is often on black ice in which crampons and other high tech climbing equipment are required .",

Ecuador also includes the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in the Pacific , about 1,000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) west of the mainland . The capital city is Quito , which is also its largest city . The territories of modern-day Ecuador were once home to a variety of Amerindian groups that were gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century . The territory was colonized by Spain during the 16th century , achieving independence in 1820 as part of Gran Colombia , from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830 . The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador 's ethnically diverse population , with most of its 17.1 million people being mestizos , followed by large minorities of European , Amerindian , and African descendants . Spanish is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population , though 13 Amerindian languages are also recognized , including Quichua and Shuar . The sovereign state of Ecuador is a middle-income representative democratic republic with a developing economy that is highly dependent on commodities , namely petroleum and agricultural products . It is governed as a democratic presidential republic . One of 18 megadiverse countries in the world , Ecuador hosts many endemic plants and animals , such as those of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands . In recognition of its unique ecological heritage , the new constitution of 2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable Rights of Nature , or ecosystem rights . It also has the fifth lowest homicide rate in the Americas .",

  "/wiki/Sangay": "Sangay ( also known as Macas , Sanagay , or Sangai ) is an active stratovolcano in central Ecuador . It is the most active volcano in Ecuador , despite erupting only three times in recorded history , because the eruption that started in 1934 is still ongoing . It exhibits mostly strombolian activity . Geologically , Sangay marks the southern boundary of the Northern Volcanic Zone , and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity . Sangay 's approximately 500,000-year-old history is one of instability ; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses , evidence of which still litters its surroundings today . Due to its remoteness , Sangay hosts a significant biological community with fauna such as the mountain tapir , giant otter , Andean cock-of-the-rock and king vulture . Since 1983 , its ecological community has been protected as part of the Sangay National Park . Although climbing the mountain is hampered by its remoteness , poor weather conditions , river flooding , and the danger of falling ejecta , the volcano is regularly climbed , a feat first achieved by Robert T. Moore in 1929 .",

  "/wiki/Sumaco": "Sumaco is a symmetrical , isolated stratovolcano , that is set off from the main Ecuador volcanic axis . Its rocks are very distinct from those from most Andean volcanoes because of its lack of andesitic composition , in favour of basanite and phonolitic rock .

  "/wiki/Imbabura_Volcano": "Imbabura is an inactive stratovolcano in northern Ecuador . Although it has not erupted for at least 14,000 years , it is not thought to be extinct . Imbabura is intermittently capped with snow and has no permanent glaciers . Covered in volcanic ash , the slopes of Imbabura are especially fertile . In addition to cloud forests , which are found across the northern Andes to an altitude of 3000 m , the land around Imbabura is extensively farmed . Maize , sugarcane , and beans are all staple crops of the region . Cattle are also an important commodity , and much of the land on and around Imbabura , especially the high-altitude meadows above the tree line , is used for grazing ."
