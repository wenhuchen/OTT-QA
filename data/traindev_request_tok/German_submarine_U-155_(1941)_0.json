  "/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland": "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was a sovereign state established by the Acts of Union 1800 , which merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland . The United Kingdom , having financed the European coalition that defeated France during the Napoleonic Wars , developed a large Royal Navy that enabled the British Empire to become the foremost world power for the next century . The Crimean War with Russia was a relatively small operation in a century where Britain was largely at peace with the Great Powers . Rapid industrialisation that began in the decades prior to the state 's formation continued up until the mid-19th century . The Great Irish Famine , exacerbated by government inaction in the mid-19th century , led to demographic collapse in much of Ireland and increased calls for Irish land reform . The 19th century was an era of rapid economic modernisation and growth of industry , trade and finance , in which Britain largely dominated the world economy . Outward migration was heavy to the principal British overseas possessions and to the United States . The empire was expanded into most parts of Africa and much of South Asia . The Colonial Office and India Office ruled through a small number of administrators who managed the units of the empire locally , while democratic institutions began to develop . British India , by far the most important overseas possession , saw a short-lived revolt in 1857 . In overseas policy , the central policy was free trade , which enabled British and Irish financiers and merchants to operate successfully in many otherwise independent countries , as in South America . London formed no permanent military alliances until the early 20th century , when it began to cooperate with Japan , France and Russia , and moved closer to the United States .",
