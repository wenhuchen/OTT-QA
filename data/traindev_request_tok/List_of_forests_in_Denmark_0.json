The forest covers 3,800 hectares ( 9,400 acres ) , making it Denmark 's third largest . Though it was at one time common grazing land for cattle , it was fenced in for forestry in 1809 by Hans R\u00f8mer , the forest supervisor . As a result , by the beginning of the 20th century , Bornholm had become Denmark 's most forested region . Bornholm 's highest point is Rytterkn\u00e6gten at 162 metres ( 531 ft ) , where there is a memorial to Frederick VII of Denmark and Countess Danner 's visit to the island in 1851 . In 2012 , the Nature Agency brought seven European bison from a Polish primeval forest to a 200 acres ( 81 ha ) paddock in Almindingen , marking the first time in 2,500 years that Europe 's heaviest land-living mammals were in Denmark .

Occupying an area of 588.36 square kilometres ( 227.17 sq mi ) , the island had a total population on 1 January 2019 of 39,572 . Among Bornholm 's chief industrial activities are dairy farming and arts and crafts industries such as glass production and pottery using locally worked clay . Tourism is also important during the summer months . The island is home to an especially large number of Denmark 's round churches . The island is known as solskins\u00f8en ( Sunshine Island ) because of its weather and klippe\u00f8en ( Rock Island ) because of its geology , which consists of granite , except along the southern coast . The heat from the summer is stored in the rock formations and the weather is quite warm until October . As a result of the climate , a local variety of the common fig , known as Bornholm 's Diamond , can grow locally on the island . The island 's topography consists of dramatic rock formations in the north ( unlike the rest of Denmark , which is mostly gentle rolling hills ) sloping down towards pine and deciduous forests ( greatly affected by storms in the 1950s ) , farmland in the middle and sandy beaches in the south . Strategically located in the Baltic Sea , Bornholm has been fought over for centuries . Usually it had been ruled by Denmark , but also by Sweden and L\u00fcbeck , Germany . The ruin of Hammershus , at the northwestern tip of the island , is the largest medieval fortress in northern Europe , testament to the importance of its location .",
