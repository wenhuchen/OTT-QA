Notre Dame , which beat top-ranked and undefeated Texas in the Cotton Bowl , became the national champion . The 1977 season was the last before NCAA 's Division I was divided into I-A and I-AA . On the eve of a national playoff for the smaller programs that would be I-AA , the Sugar Bowl in 1977 became the fourth bowl game to sign a contract guaranteeing an appearance by a major conference champion . The result was that meetings between the media poll choices for the top two teams were less likely , unless those teams were in the Big Ten and Pac-8 ( which met in the Rose Bowl ) , or one of the teams was not obligated to play in a particular bowl game . Besides the Big Ten-Pac-8 matchup in the Rose Bowl , the Southwest champion played in the Cotton , the Big Eight titlist in the Orange , and the SEC champ in the Sugar . Top teams that had their choice of which bowl to play were either independent or in a conference outside the five major powers ( such as the ACC or WAC ) . During the 20th century , the NCAA had no playoff for major college football teams , which became Division I-A in 1978 . The NCAA Football Guide , however , did note an unofficial national champion based on the top ranked teams in the final wire service ( AP and UPI ) polls . The writers ' poll by Associated Press ( AP ) was the most popular , followed by the coaches ' poll by United Press International ) ( UPI ) . The AP poll consisted of the votes of as many as 64 writers , though not all voted in each poll , and the UPI poll was taken of a 42-member board of coaches .",
