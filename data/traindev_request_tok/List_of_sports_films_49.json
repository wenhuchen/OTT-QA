A talented swimmer and artist , she also became interested in dancing during her childhood , taking dancing lessons and performing across Europe . After seeing a promotional poster for the 1924 film Der Berg des Schicksals ( The Mountain of Destiny ) , Riefenstahl was inspired to move into acting . Between 1925 and 1929 , she starred in five successful motion pictures . Riefenstahl became one of the few women in Germany to direct a film during the Weimar Period when , in 1932 , she decided to try directing with her own film called Das Blaue Licht ( The Blue Light ) . In the 1930s , she directed the Nazi propaganda films Triumph des Willens ( Triumph of the Will ) and Olympia , resulting in worldwide attention and acclaim . The movies are widely considered two of the most effective , and technically innovative , propaganda films ever made . Her involvement in Triumph des Willens , however , significantly damaged her career and reputation after the war . Hitler was in close collaboration with Riefenstahl during the production of at least three important Nazi films , and they formed a friendly relationship . Some have argued that Riefenstahl 's visions were essential to the carrying out of the mission of the Holocaust . After the war , Riefenstahl was arrested , but classified as being a fellow traveler or Nazi sympathizer only and was not associated with war crimes . Throughout her life , she denied having known about the Holocaust .",
