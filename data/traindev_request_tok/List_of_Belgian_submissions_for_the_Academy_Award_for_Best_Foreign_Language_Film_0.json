Originally scheduled for April 8 , 1968 , the awards were postponed to two days later , April 10 , 1968 , because of the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Bob Hope was once again the host of the ceremony . Due to the increasing rarity of black and white feature films , the awards for cinematography , art direction and costume design were combined into single categories rather than a distinction between color and monochrome . The Best Picture nominees were an eclectic group of films reflecting the chaos of their era . The event was the first one since the 1948 awards show to feature film clips from the Best Picture nominated films . This year 's nominations also marked the first time that three different films were nominated for the Top Five Academy Awards : Best Picture , Director , Actor , Actress and Screenplay . The three films were Bonnie and Clyde , The Graduate and Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner . However , the winner of Best Picture was producer Walter Mirisch and director Norman Jewison 's thriller/mystery film , In the Heat of the Night ( with seven nominations and five wins - Best Picture , Best Actor , Best Screenplay , Best Film Editing and Best Sound ) . The Graduate is , as of the 91st Academy Awards , the last film to win Best Director and nothing else . Due to an all-out push by Academy President Gregory Peck , 18 of the 20 acting nominees were present at the ceremony . Only Katharine Hepburn and the late Spencer Tracy , who was nominated posthumously , were missing .",

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire , as did all Romance languages . French evolved from Gallo-Romance , the spoken Latin in Gaul , and more specifically in Northern Gaul . Its closest relatives are the other langues d'o\u00efl - languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium , which French ( Francien ) has largely supplanted . French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the ( Germanic ) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders . Today , owing to France 's past overseas expansion , there are numerous French-based creole languages , most notably Haitian Creole . A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French . French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents , most of which are members of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie ( OIF ) , the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French . It is spoken as a first language ( in descending order of the number of speakers ) in France , the Canadian provinces of Quebec , Ontario and New Brunswick as well as other Francophone regions , Belgium ( Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region ) , western Switzerland ( cantons of Bern , Fribourg , Geneva , Jura , Neuch\u00e2tel , Vaud , Valais ) , Monaco , partly in Luxembourg , the states of Louisiana , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States , and in northwestern Italy ( region of Aosta Valley ) , and by various communities elsewhere . In 2015 , approximately 40% of the francophone population ( including L2 and partial speakers ) lived in Europe , 35% in sub-Saharan Africa , 15% in North Africa and the Middle East , 8% in the Americas , and 1% in Asia and Oceania . French is the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union . Of Europeans who speak other languages natively , approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language .",

It is named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name , as England . Both names derive from Anglia , a peninsula in the Baltic Sea . The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon , and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent by Latin and French . English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic ( Ingvaeonic ) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century , are collectively called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England ; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London , the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States . Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science , navigation and law . English is the largest language by number of speakers , and the third most-spoken native language in the world , after Standard Chinese and Spanish .
