  "/wiki/Cultural_Revolution": "The Cultural Revolution , formally the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution , was a sociopolitical movement in the People 's Republic of China from 1966 until 1976 . Launched by Mao Zedong , then Chairman of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , its stated goal was to preserve Chinese Communism by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society , and to re-impose Mao Zedong Thought ( known outside China as Maoism ) as the dominant ideology in the CPC . The Revolution marked Mao 's return to a position of power after a period of less radical leadership to recover from the failures of the Great Leap Forward , whose policies led to famine and approximately 30 million deaths only five years earlier . The Cultural Revolution damaged China 's economy while tens of millions of people were persecuted , with an estimated death toll ranging from hundreds of thousands to 20 million . Starting from the Red August of Beijing , massacres took place across the country , such as the Guangxi Massacre ( massive cannibalism also occurred ) , the Inner Mongolia incident , the Yunnan Massacre and the Daoxian massacre . Mao launched the movement in May 1966 , soon calling on young people to bombard the headquarters and proclaiming that to rebel is justified . Mao charged that bourgeois elements had infiltrated the government and society and that they aimed to restore capitalism . Lin Biao , head of the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) , was written into the constitution as Mao 's successor ; Lin had compiled the Little Red Book , a selection of Mao 's sayings , that became a sacred text for Mao 's personality cult . To eliminate his rivals within the CPC and in schools , factories , and government institutions , Mao insisted that revisionists be removed through violent class struggle . China 's youth responded by forming Red Guard groups around the country , which split into rival factions and often involved in violent struggles ( wudou ) . Schools and universities were closed . Urban workers likewise split into factions , and the PLA had to be sent to restore order .",
