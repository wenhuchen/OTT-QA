  "/wiki/C._S._Lewis": "Clive Staples Lewis ( 29 November 1898 - 22 November 1963 ) was a British writer and lay theologian . He held academic positions in English literature at both Oxford University ( Magdalen College , 1925-1954 ) and Cambridge University ( Magdalene College , 1954-1963 ) .

Lewis and fellow novelist J. R. R. Tolkien were close friends . They both served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings . According to Lewis 's memoir Surprised by Joy , he was baptised in the Church of Ireland , but fell away from his faith during adolescence . Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32 , owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends , and he became an ordinary layman of the Church of England . Lewis 's faith profoundly affected his work , and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim . Lewis wrote more than 30 books which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies . The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularised on stage , TV , radio , and cinema . His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian apologists from many denominations .

  "/wiki/Fantasy": "Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction set in a fictional universe , often inspired by real world myth and folklore . Its roots are in oral traditions , which then became fantasy literature and drama . From the twentieth century it has expanded further into various media , including film , television , graphic novels , manga and video games . Fantasy is distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the absence of scientific or macabre themes respectively , though these genres overlap . In popular culture , the fantasy genre predominantly features settings of a medieval nature . In its broadest sense , however , fantasy consists of works by many writers , artists , filmmakers , and musicians from ancient myths and legends to many recent and popular works .",

Rider Haggard , first serialised in The Graphic magazine from October 1886 to January 1887 . She was extraordinarily popular upon its release and has never been out of print .

They encounter a primitive race of natives and a mysterious white queen named Ayesha who reigns as the all-powerful She or She-who-must-be-obeyed . Haggard developed many of the conventions of the lost world genre which many authors have emulated . She is placed in the imperialist literature of nineteenth-century England and inspired by Haggard 's experiences of South Africa and British colonialism . The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary conceptions of the late Victorians , especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the fin de si\u00e8cle . In the figure of She , the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour . It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood .",

The Da Vinci Code follows symbologist Robert Langdon and cryptologist Sophie Neveu after a murder in the Louvre Museum in Paris causes them to become involved in a battle between the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei over the possibility of Jesus Christ having been a companion to Mary Magdalene .

The book also refers to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail ( 1982 ) though Dan Brown has stated that it was not used as research material .

  "/wiki/Mystery_(fiction)": "Mystery fiction is a genre of fiction usually involving a mysterious death or a crime to be solved . Often with a closed circle of suspects , each suspect is usually provided with a credible motive and a reasonable opportunity for committing the crime . The central character will often be a detective ( like Sherlock Holmes and his assistant John H. Watson ) who eventually solves the mystery by logical deduction from facts presented to the reader . Sometimes mystery books are nonfictional . Mystery fiction can be detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle or suspense element and its logical solution such as a whodunit . Mystery fiction can be contrasted with hardboiled detective stories , which focus on action and gritty realism . Mystery fiction involve a supernatural mystery where the solution does not have to be logical , and even no crime involved . This usage was common in the pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s , where titles such as Dime Mystery , Thrilling Mystery and Spicy Mystery offered what at the time were described as complicated to solve and weird stories - supernatural horror in the vein of Grand Guignol . This contrasted with parallel titles of the same names which contained conventional hardboiled crime fiction . The first use of mystery in this sense was by Dime Mystery , which started out as an ordinary crime fiction magazine but switched to weird menace during the later part of 1933 .",

  "/wiki/Historical_fiction": "Historical fiction is a literary genre in which the plot takes place in a setting located in the past . Although the term is commonly used as a synonym for the historical novel , it can also be applied to other types of narrative , including theatre , opera , cinema and television , as well as video games and graphic novels . An essential element of historical fiction is that it is set in the past and pays attention to the manners , social conditions and other details of the period depicted . Authors also frequently choose to explore notable historical figures in these settings , allowing readers to better understand how these individuals might have responded to their environments . Some subgenres such as alternate history and historical fantasy insert speculative or ahistorical elements into a novel . Works of historical fiction are sometimes criticized for lack of authenticity because of readerly or genre expectations for accurate period details . This tension between historical authenticity , or historicity , and fiction frequently becomes a point of comment for readers and popular critics , while scholarly criticism frequently goes beyond this commentary , investigating the genre for its other thematic and critical interests . Historical fiction as a contemporary Western literary genre has its foundations in the early-19th-century works of Sir Walter Scott and his contemporaries in other national literatures such as the Frenchman Honor\u00e9 de Balzac , the American James Fenimore Cooper , and a later Russian , Leo Tolstoy . However , the melding of historical and fiction in individual works of literature has a long tradition in most cultures ; both western traditions ( as early as Ancient Greek and Roman literature ) as well as Eastern , in the form of oral and folk traditions ( see mythology and folklore ) , which produced epics , novels , plays and other fictional works describing history for contemporary audiences .",

  "/wiki/Magic_realism": "Magical realism , magic realism , or marvelous realism is a style of fiction that paints a realistic view of the modern world while also adding magical elements . It is sometimes called fabulism , in reference to the conventions of fables , myths , and allegory . Magical realism , perhaps the most common term , often refers to fiction and literature in particular , :1-5 with magic or the supernatural presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane setting , commonly seen in novels and dramatic performances . It is considered a subgenre of fantasy . The terms are broadly descriptive rather than critically rigorous . Matthew Strecher defines magic realism as what happens when a highly detailed , realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe . Many writers are categorized as magical realists , which confuses the term and its wide definition . Irene Guenther tackles the German roots of the term , and how art is related to literature . Magical realism is often associated with Latin American literature , particularly authors including genre founders Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez , Miguel Angel Asturias , Jorge Luis Borges , Elena Garro , Mireya Robles , Juan Rulfo , R\u00f3mulo Gallegos , Arturo Uslar Pietri , and Isabel Allende .

  "/wiki/Benjamin_Spock": "Benjamin McLane Spock ( May 2 , 1903 - March 15 , 1998 ) was an American pediatrician whose book Baby and Child Care ( 1946 ) is one of the best-selling volumes in history . The book 's premise to mothers is that you know more than you think you do . Spock was the first pediatrician to study psychoanalysis to try to understand children 's needs and family dynamics . His ideas about childcare influenced several generations of parents to be more flexible and affectionate with their children , and to treat them as individuals . However , his theories were also widely criticized by colleagues for relying too heavily on anecdotal evidence rather than serious academic research . Spock was an activist in the New Left and anti Vietnam War movements during the 1960s and early 1970s . At the time , his books were criticized for propagating permissiveness and an expectation of instant gratification which allegedly led young people to join these movements - a charge that Spock denied . Spock also won an Olympic gold medal in rowing in 1924 while attending Yale University ."
