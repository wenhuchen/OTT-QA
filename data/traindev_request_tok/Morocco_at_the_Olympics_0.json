He competed at the 1960 Olympics in the marathon and 10,000 meters events . He also ran in the International Cross Country Championships in 1958-1963 . In March 1960 , he and Belgium 's Gaston Roelants quickly broke away from the field , and he became the first African athlete to win the individual gold medal in that event , defeating Roelants by 40 yards . On September 8 , 1960 , he finished in 14th place in the finals-only 10,000 meters , in 29:32.0 , almost a minute behind the winner , the Soviet Union 's Pyotr Bolotnikov , who broke the Olympic record for the event . Just two days later , the blazing pace through the first 20 kilometers in the marathon helped result in an eventual world record for the barefoot winner , Ethiopia 's Abebe Bikila . After they dispatched the rest of the field by 25 kilometers , the leading pair stayed stride-for-stride until the final 500 meters , with Ben Abdesselam finishing a close second in 2:15:41.6 , 25.4 seconds behind Abebe 's new world record . Abebe 's mark trimmed 8/10ths of a second off Sergei Popov 's world record of 2:15:17.0 , set in 1958 . Ironically , Abebe had been advised to watch out for Ben Abdesselam , but the latter wore his 10,000 meter competition number , so Abebe was unaware of the identity of his pursuer . Popov finished 5th in Rome , two minutes behind New Zealand 's Barry Magee , who took the bronze medal .",

  "/wiki/Boxing_at_the_2000_Summer_Olympics": "The boxing competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney , Australia was held at the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre in Darling Harbour . The event was only open to men and bouts were contested over four rounds of two minutes each . Five judges scored the fighters in real time and the boxer with the most points at the end was the winner . Like other Olympic combat sports , two bronze medals are awarded ; in the case of boxing , both losing semi-finalists receive a bronze medal , with no further play-off . As a result , the quarter-final essentially equates to a bronze medal match , a semi-final to a silver medal match , and the final to a gold medal match . 48 medals are therefore available , half of which are bronze medals .",

The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete , some 600 more than expected , accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries . There were 301 medal events in 28 different sports . Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance . 2004 also marked the return of the Olympic Games to the city where they began . Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1896 , Athens became one of only four cities to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two separate occasions at the time ( together with Paris , London , and Los Angeles ) . A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games , replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games . This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue . The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium . The 2004 Summer Games were hailed as unforgettable , dream games by IOC President Jacques Rogge , and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure , including a new airport , ring road , and subway system . There have been arguments ( mostly in popular media ) regarding the cost of the 2004 Athens Summer Games and their possible contribution to the 2010-2018 Greek government-debt crisis , however , there is little or no evidence for such a correlation . The 2004 Olympics were generally deemed to be a success , with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world .",

The first round comprised three heats with the first five gaining a direct qualification and then the next nine fastest across all heats progressing to the semifinals . The top five runners in each of the two semifinal heats moved on directly to the final , and they were immediately joined by the next two fastest from any of the semifinals . World record holder Hicham El Guerrouj came into the race with a target on his back . Though El Guerrouj had won four straight World Championships , he had failed to win the previous Olympics , falling with a lap to go in his breakthrough year of 1996 and being beaten to the line in 2000 by the same Noah Ngeny who had chased El Guerrouj to the mile world record a year earlier . Ngeny was not back but bronze medalist Bernard Lagat was , seeking to finally beat El Guerrouj . Lagat had the potential assistance of two Kenyan teammates , but El Guerrouj also had his teammate Adil Kaouch make the final and Kaouch had previously sacrificed himself by acting as a pacesetter leading El Guerrouj to the 1999 and 2001 world titles . Because of the assistance , El Guerrouj 's ability in a strategic race was suspect . Off the line , the three Kenyan runners took the lead and formed a wall keeping the field behind as they slowed the pace ; El Guerrouj could not run away from the start and the race would be strategic . With 500 metres to go , El Guerrouj worked his way to the front , with a line of kickers including Lagat , Reyes Estevez , Ivan Heshko and the unknown Mulugeta Wendimu lined up behind him . Down the backstretch , Lagat stayed a step behind El Guerrouj as other speedsters jockeyed for position and then fell back . From deep in the pack ( dead last with less than 500 metres to go ) , Rui Silva was on the outside passing the others .",

The race had a preview at the World Championships a year earlier . There the medalists were barely separated , but the young World Junior record holder Eliud Kipchoge upset the stars by taking gold after El Guerrouj had tried to break away on the final lap . Here Bekele took an early lead , but instead chose not to push the pace . That duty fell onto Kipchoge , who had watched from behind the year before . Here , El Guerrouj spent most of the race watching from several places behind the lead . As the last lap began , El Guerrouj moved toward the front . Bekele challenged Kipchoge with 200 metres to go . It was a shoulder to shoulder all out sprint battle as Kipchoge refused to let Bekele by , but he could n't hold him off . Bekele broke out at a lead of several metres . El Guerrouj first ran down Kipchoge , then overhauled the Ethiopian in the final strides to win by just two tenths of a second .",

The final started with a fast first 200 metres , but Kelly Holmes and Maria de Lurdes Mutola were last at this stage . As the pace slowed , Mutola and Holmes moved forward through the field . The time at 400 metres was 56.37 seconds , with American Jearl Miles Clark leading . They entered the finishing straight with Mutola taking the lead , before Holmes took the lead and held off Mutola to take gold .

These were the second summer Olympic Games staged in a Communist country , after the Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics and the third in a developing country after the Mexico City 1968 Summer Olympics and the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union and the first overall Olympics to be hosted by a Communist state since the former Yugoslavia hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo . Beijing was awarded the 2008 Games over four competitors on 13 July 2001 , having won a majority of votes from members of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) after two rounds of voting . The Government of the People 's Republic of China promoted the Games and invested heavily in new facilities and transport systems .
