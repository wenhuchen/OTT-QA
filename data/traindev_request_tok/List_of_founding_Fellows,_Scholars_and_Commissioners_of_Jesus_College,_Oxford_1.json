The building itself was a Benedictine monastic church until the monastery was dissolved in 1539 . Between 1540 and 1556 , the abbey had the status of a cathedral . Since 1560 , the building is no longer an abbey or a cathedral , having instead the status of a Church of England Royal Peculiar - a church responsible directly to the sovereign .

Construction of the present church began in 1245 , on the orders of King Henry III . Since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066 , all coronations of English and British monarchs have been in Westminster Abbey . There have been 16 royal weddings at the abbey since 1100 .

  "/wiki/Court_of_Chancery": "The Court of Chancery was a court of equity in England and Wales that followed a set of loose rules to avoid the slow pace of change and possible harshness ( or inequity ) of the common law . The Chancery had jurisdiction over all matters of equity , including trusts , land law , the estates of lunatics and the guardianship of infants . Its initial role was somewhat different : as an extension of the Lord Chancellor 's role as Keeper of the King 's Conscience , the Court was an administrative body primarily concerned with conscientious law . Thus the Court of Chancery had a far greater remit than the common law courts , whose decisions it had the jurisdiction to overrule for much of its existence , and was far more flexible . Until the 19th century , the Court of Chancery could apply a far wider range of remedies than common law courts , such as specific performance and injunctions , and had some power to grant damages in special circumstances . With the shift of the Exchequer of Pleas towards a common law court and loss of its equitable jurisdiction by the Administration of Justice Act 1841 , the Chancery became the only national equitable body in the English legal system . Academics estimate that the Court of Chancery formally split from and became independent of the curia regis in the mid-14th century , at which time it consisted of the Lord Chancellor and his personal staff , the Chancery . Initially an administrative body with some judicial duties , the Chancery experienced an explosive growth in its work during the 15th century , particularly under the House of York , which academics attribute to its becoming an almost entirely judicial body . From the time of Elizabeth I onwards the Court was severely criticised for its slow pace , large backlogs , and high costs . Those problems persisted until its dissolution , despite being mitigated somewhat by reforms , particularly during the 19th century . Attempts at fusing the Chancery with the common law courts began in the 1850s , and finally succeeded with the 1873 and 1875 Supreme Court of Judicature Acts , which dissolved the Chancery and created a new unified High Court of Justice , with the Chancery Division - one of three divisions of the High Court - succeeding the Court of Chancery as an equitable body . For much of its existence the Court was formally led by the Lord Chancellor , assisted by the judges of the common law courts ."
