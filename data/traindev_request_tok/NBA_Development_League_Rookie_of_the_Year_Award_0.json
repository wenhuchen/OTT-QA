Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government , though Spanish predominates . Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people , Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 . It was contested by the French , Dutch , and British , but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries . The island 's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population , the forced migration of African slaves , and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain .

Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest . Egypt 's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , which has endured , and often assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman Turkish , and Nubian . Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity , but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country , albeit with a significant Christian minority . From the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century , Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers : The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire . Modern Egypt dates back to 1922 , when it gained nominal independence from the British Empire as a monarchy . However , British military occupation of Egypt continued , and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism . Following the 1952 revolution , Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation , nationalized the British-held Suez Canal , exiled King Farouk and his family , and declared itself a republic .",

  "/wiki/Center_(basketball)": "The center ( C ) , also known as the five position , or the big man , is one of the five positions in a basketball game . The center is normally the tallest player on the team , and often has a great deal of strength and body mass as well . In the NBA , the center is usually 6 feet 10 inches ( 2.08 m ) or taller and usually weighs 240 pounds ( 110 kg ) or more . They traditionally have played close to the basket in the low post . Centers are valued for their ability to protect their own goal while scoring with high efficiency . In the 1950s and 1960s , George Mikan and Bill Russell were centerpieces of championship dynasties and defined early prototypical centers . With the addition of a three-point field goal for the 1979-80 season , however , NBA basketball gradually became more perimeter-oriented and saw the importance of the center position diminished . A center with the ability to shoot outside from three-point range is known as stretch five .",
  "/wiki/Dominican_Republic": "The Dominican Republic ( /d\u0259\u02c8m\u026an\u026ak\u0259n/ d\u0259-MIN-ik-\u0259n ; Spanish : Rep\u00fablica Dominicana , pronounced [ re\u02c8pu\u03b2lika \u00f0omini\u02c8kana ] ( listen ) ) is a country located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean region . It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island , which it shares with the Republic of Haiti , making Hispaniola one of only two Caribbean islands , along with Saint Martin , that are shared by two sovereign states . The Dominican Republic is the second-largest nation in the Antilles by area ( after Cuba ) at 48,671 square kilometers ( 18,792 sq mi ) , and third by population with approximately 10.5 million people ( 2020 est . ) , of whom approximately 3.3 million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo , the capital city . The native Ta\u00edno people had inhabited Hispaniola before the arrival of the Europeans , dividing it into five chiefdoms . The Ta\u00edno people had eventually moved north over many years , and lived around the Caribbean islands . The Ta\u00edno natives had done quite well for themselves and were on their way to being an organized civilization . Christopher Columbus explored and claimed the island , landing here on his first voyage in 1492 . The colony of Santo Domingo became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas , the oldest continuously inhabited city , and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World . Meanwhile , France occupied the western third of Hispaniola , naming their colony Saint-Domingue , which became the independent state of Haiti in 1804 . After more than three hundred years of Spanish rule the Dominican people declared independence in November 1821 . The leader of the independence movement Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres , intended the Dominican nation to unite with the country of Gran Colombia , but the newly independent Dominicans were forcefully annexed by Haiti in February 1822 .",
