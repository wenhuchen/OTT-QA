[ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Cal_Orcko": "The Cal Orcko tracksite is exposed in a quarry wall , approximately 4.4 km NW of Sucre ( Department Chuquisaca , Bolivia ) in the Altiplano/Cordillera Oriental , in the El Molino Formation ( Middle Maastrichtian ) . Fossiliferous oolitic limestones , associated with large , freshwater stromatolites and nine levels of dinosaur tracks in the El Molino Formation document an open lacustrine environment . The main track-bearing level is almost vertical with a surface area of ~ 65,000 m2 . The high-resolution mapping of the site from 1998 to 2015 revealed a total of 12,092 individual dinosaur tracks in 465 trackways . Nine different morphotypes of dinosaur tracks have been documented . Amongst them are several trackways of theropods , ornithopods , ankylosaurs and sauropods , with the latter group accounting for 26% of the trackways .",

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

  "/wiki/Djadochta_Formation": "The Djadochta Formation ( sometimes transcribed Djadokhta ) is a geological formation situated in central Asia ( Gobi Desert ) , dating from the Late Cretaceous Period . Laid down in the early Campanian , possibly starting in the latest Santonian , it is dated somewhat uncertainly at about 75-71 mya ( million years ago ) . The type locality are the famous Flaming Cliffs , locally known as Bayanzag ( rich in Haloxylon ) or Ulaan-Ereg ( red cliffs ) . It preserves an arid habitat of sand dunes , with little freshwater apart from oases and arroyos . In fact , the present-day climate at most Djadochta Formation sites differs little from what it was some 80 mya , except by being somewhat warmer and perhaps a bit less arid then . This is testimony to the fact that the location has long been so far from any major source of evaporation that little rainfall reached it , even before the Himalayas were uplifted which bar clouds from reaching today 's Gobi desert . Most notable fossil discoveries have been the first confirmed dinosaur eggs ( a clutch , probably of Oviraptor ) and several dinosaur finds , Protoceratops , Pinacosaurus and Velociraptor being the most prominent .",

[ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II .",

Its southern border with the United States , stretching some 8,891 kilometres ( 5,525 mi ) , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As a whole , Canada is sparsely populated , with most of its land area dominated by forest and tundra . Its population is highly urbanized , with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , and 70 percent residing within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the southern border . Canada 's climate varies widely across its vast area , ranging from Arctic climate in the north to hot summers in the southern regions , with four distinct seasons . Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of various armed conflicts , France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation , Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces . This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom .",

The traditional homelands of the Tajik people include present-day Tajikistan as well as parts of Afghanistan and Uzbekistan . The territory that now constitutes Tajikistan was previously home to several ancient cultures , including the city of Sarazm of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age , and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures , including the Oxus civilisation , Andronovo culture , Buddhism , Nestorian Christianity , Zoroastrianism , Manichaeism and Islam . The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Achaemenid Empire , Sasanian Empire , Hephthalite Empire , Samanid Empire , Mongol Empire , Timurid dynasty , the Khanate of Bukhara , the Russian Empire , and subsequently the Soviet Union . Within the Soviet Union , the country 's modern borders were drawn when it was part of Uzbekistan as an autonomous republic before becoming a full-fledged Soviet republic in 1929 . On 9 September 1991 , Tajikistan became an independent sovereign nation when the Soviet Union disintegrated . A civil war was fought almost immediately after independence , lasting from 1992 to 1997 . Since the end of the war , newly established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country 's economy to grow . Like all other Central Asian neighbouring states , the country , led by President Emomali Rahmon since 1994 , has been criticised by a number of non-governmental organizations for authoritarian leadership , lack of religious freedom , corruption and widespread violations of human rights . Tajikistan is a presidential republic consisting of four provinces . Most of Tajikistan 's population belongs to the Tajik ethnic group , who speak Tajik ( a dialect of Persian ) .",
