It can be considered the highest mountain in Europe , taking into account that the Caucasus mountains are at the intersection of Europe and Asia , and it is the tenth most prominent peak in the world . Elbrus has two summits , both of which are dormant volcanic domes . The taller west summit is 5,642 metres ( 18,510 ft ) ; the east summit is 5,621 metres ( 18,442 ft ) . The east summit was first ascended on 10 July 1829 ( Julian calendar ) by Khillar Khachirov , and the west summit in 1874 by a British expedition led by F. Crauford Grove and including Frederick Gardner , Horace Walker , and the Swiss guide Peter Knubel of St. Niklaus . While authorities differ on how the Caucasus are distributed between Europe and Asia , most relevant modern authorities define the continental boundary as the Caucasus watershed , placing Elbrus in Europe due to its position on the north side of the watershed in Russia .",

  "/wiki/Armenia": "The original native Armenian name for the country was \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0584 ( Hayk ) ; however , it is currently rarely used . The contemporary name \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576 ( Hayastan ) became popular in the Middle Ages by addition of the Persian suffix -stan ( place ) . [ citation needed ] . However the origins of the name Hayastan trace back to much earlier dates and were first attested in circa 5th century in the works of Agathangelos , Faustus of Byzantium , Ghazar Parpetsi , Koryun , and Sebeos . The name has traditionally been derived from Hayk ( \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f ) , the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah , who , according to the 5th-century AD author Moses of Chorene ( Movsis Khorenatsi ) , defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region . The further origin of the name is uncertain . It is also further postulated that the name Hay comes from one of the two confederated , Hittite vassal states - the \u1e2aaya\u0161a-Azzi ( 1600-1200 BC ) . The exonym Armenia is attested in the Old Persian Behistun Inscription ( 515 BC ) as Armina ( ) . The Ancient Greek terms \u1f08\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 ( Armen\u00eda ) and \u1f08\u03c1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 ( Arm\u00e9nioi , Armenians ) are first mentioned by Hecataeus of Miletus ( c. 550 BC - c. 476 BC ) . Xenophon , a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions , describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC . Some scholars have linked the name Armenia with the Early Bronze Age state of Armani ( Armanum , Armi ) or the Late Bronze Age state of Arme ( Shupria ) .
