Its returning staff from Mother ( 1989 ) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer Satoru Iwata , as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka , who incorporated a diverse range of styles into the soundtrack , including salsa , reggae , and dub . Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original Mother , and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team . Originally scheduled for release in January 1993 , the game was completed around May 1994 . Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture , EarthBound subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a real world setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre . Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone ; for example , the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues , experiences in-game hallucinations , and battles piles of vomit , taxi cabs , and walking nooses . For its American release , the game was marketed with a $ 2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed this game stinks . Additionally , the game 's puns and humor were reworked by localizer Marcus Lindblom , and the title was changed from Mother 2 to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to .
