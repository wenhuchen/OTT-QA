  "/wiki/Georg_Alexander_Pick": "Georg Alexander Pick ( 10 August 1859 - 26 July 1942 ) was an Austrian born mathematician . He was born in a Jewish family to Josefa Schleisinger and Adolf Josef Pick . He died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp . Today he is best known for Pick 's theorem for determining the area of lattice polygons . He published it in an article in 1899 ; it was popularized when Hugo Dyonizy Steinhaus included it in the 1969 edition of Mathematical Snapshots . Pick studied at the University of Vienna and defended his Ph.D. in 1880 under Leo K\u00f6nigsberger and Emil Weyr . After receiving his doctorate he was appointed an assistant to Ernst Mach at the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague . He became a lecturer there in 1881 . He took a leave from the university in 1884 during which he worked with Felix Klein at the University of Leipzig . Other than that year , he remained in Prague until his retirement in 1927 at which time he returned to Vienna . Pick headed the committee at the ( then ) German university of Prague which appointed Albert Einstein to a chair of mathematical physics in 1911 . Pick introduced Einstein to the work of Italian mathematicians Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita in the field of absolute differential calculus , which later in 1915 helped Einstein to successfully formulate general relativity .",

  "/wiki/Theresienstadt_concentration_camp": "Theresienstadt ( Czech : Terez\u00edn [ \u02c8t\u025br\u025bzi\u02d0n ] ) was a hybrid concentration camp and ghetto established by the SS during World War II in the fortress town Terez\u00edn , located in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia ( a German-occupied region of Czechoslovakia ) . Theresienstadt served two main purposes : it was simultaneously a waystation to the extermination camps , and a retirement settlement for elderly and prominent Jews to mislead their communities about the Final Solution . Its conditions were deliberately engineered to hasten the death of its prisoners , and the ghetto also served a propaganda role . Unlike other ghettos , the exploitation of forced labor was not economically significant . The ghetto was established by a transport of Czech Jews in November 1941 . The first German and Austrian Jews arrived in June 1942 ; Dutch and Danish Jews came beginning in 1943 and prisoners of a wide variety of nationalities were sent to Theresienstadt in the last months of the war . About 33,000 people died at Theresienstadt , mostly from malnutrition and disease . More than 88,000 people were held there for months or years before being deported to extermination camps and other killing sites ; the Jewish self-administration 's role in choosing those to be deported has attracted significant controversy . Including 4,000 of the deportees who survived , the total number of survivors was around 23,000 . Theresienstadt was known for its relatively rich cultural life , including concerts , lectures , and clandestine education for children . The fact that it was governed by a Jewish self-administration as well as the large number of prominent Jews imprisoned there facilitated the flourishing of cultural life . This spiritual legacy has attracted the attention of scholars and sparked interest in the ghetto .",

  "/wiki/Number_theory": "Number theory ( or arithmetic or higher arithmetic in older usage ) is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions . German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss ( 1777-1855 ) said , Mathematics is the queen of the sciences - and number theory is the queen of mathematics . Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers ( for example , rational numbers ) or defined as generalizations of the integers ( for example , algebraic integers ) . Number theory seeks to understand the properties of integer systems in spite of their apparent complexity . Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations ( Diophantine geometry ) . Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of analytical objects ( for example , the Riemann zeta function ) that encode properties of the integers , primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion ( analytic number theory ) . One may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers , for example , as approximated by the latter ( Diophantine approximation ) . The older term for number theory is arithmetic . By the early twentieth century , it had been superseded by number theory . [ note 1 ] ( The word arithmetic is used by the general public to mean elementary calculations ; it has also acquired other meanings in mathematical logic , as in Peano arithmetic , and computer science , as in floating point arithmetic . ) The use of the term arithmetic for number theory regained some ground in the second half of the 20th century , arguably in part due to French influence .

  "/wiki/Topology": "In mathematics , topology ( from the Greek \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 , 'place ' , and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 , 'study ' ) is concerned with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations , such as stretching , twisting , crumpling and bending , but not tearing or gluing . A topological space is a set endowed with a structure , called a topology , which allows defining continuous deformation of subspaces , and , more generally , all kinds of continuity . Euclidean spaces , and , more generally , metric spaces are examples of a topological space , as any distance or metric defines a topology . The deformations that are considered in topology are homeomorphisms and homotopies . A property that is invariant under such deformations is a topological property . Basic examples of topological properties are : the dimension , which allows distinguishing between a line and a surface ; compactness , which allows distinguishing between a line and a circle ; connectedness , which allows distinguishing a circle from two non-intersecting circles . The ideas underlying topology go back to Gottfried Leibniz , who in the 17th century envisioned the geometria situs and analysis situs . Leonhard Euler 's Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg problem and polyhedron formula are arguably the field 's first theorems . The term topology was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19th century , although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed .",
  "/wiki/Set_theory": "Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets , which informally are collections of objects . Although any type of object can be collected into a set , set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics . The language of set theory can be used to define nearly all mathematical objects . The modern study of set theory was initiated by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s . After the discovery of paradoxes in naive set theory , such as Russell 's paradox , numerous axiom systems were proposed in the early twentieth century , of which the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms , with or without the axiom of choice , are the best-known . Set theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for mathematics , particularly in the form of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice . Beyond its foundational role , set theory is a branch of mathematics in its own right , with an active research community . Contemporary research into set theory includes a diverse collection of topics , ranging from the structure of the real number line to the study of the consistency of large cardinals .",
  "/wiki/Descriptive_set_theory": "In mathematical logic , descriptive set theory ( DST ) is the study of certain classes of well-behaved subsets of the real line and other Polish spaces . As well as being one of the primary areas of research in set theory , it has applications to other areas of mathematics such as functional analysis , ergodic theory , the study of operator algebras and group actions , and mathematical logic .",
  "/wiki/Measure_theory": "In mathematical analysis , a measure on a set is a systematic way to assign a number to each suitable subset of that set , intuitively interpreted as its size . In this sense , a measure is a generalization of the concepts of length , area , and volume . A particularly important example is the Lebesgue measure on a Euclidean space , which assigns the conventional length , area , and volume of Euclidean geometry to suitable subsets of the n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn . For instance , the Lebesgue measure of the interval [ 0 , 1 ] in the real numbers is its length in the everyday sense of the word , specifically , 1 . Technically , a measure is a function that assigns a non-negative real number or +\u221e to ( certain ) subsets of a set X ( see Definition below ) . It must further be countably additive : the measure of a 'large ' subset that can be decomposed into a finite ( or countably infinite ) number of 'smaller ' disjoint subsets is equal to the sum of the measures of the smaller subsets . In general , if one wants to associate a consistent size to each subset of a given set while satisfying the other axioms of a measure , one only finds trivial examples like the counting measure . This problem was resolved by defining measure only on a sub-collection of all subsets ; the so-called measurable subsets , which are required to form a \u03c3-algebra . This means that countable unions , countable intersections and complements of measurable subsets are measurable . Non-measurable sets in a Euclidean space , on which the Lebesgue measure can not be defined consistently , are necessarily complicated in the sense of being badly mixed up with their complement . Indeed , their existence is a non-trivial consequence of the axiom of choice . Measure theory was developed in successive stages during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by \u00c9mile Borel , Henri Lebesgue , Johann Radon , and Maurice Fr\u00e9chet , among others .",

By extension , use of complex analysis also has applications in engineering fields such as nuclear , aerospace , mechanical and electrical engineering . [ citation needed ] As a differentiable function of a complex variable is equal to the sum of its Taylor series ( that is , it is analytic ) , complex analysis is particularly concerned with analytic functions of a complex variable ( that is , holomorphic functions ) .",
  "/wiki/Functional_analysis": "Functional analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis , the core of which is formed by the study of vector spaces endowed with some kind of limit-related structure ( e.g . inner product , norm , topology , etc . ) and the linear functions defined on these spaces and respecting these structures in a suitable sense . The historical roots of functional analysis lie in the study of spaces of functions and the formulation of properties of transformations of functions such as the Fourier transform as transformations defining continuous , unitary etc . operators between function spaces . This point of view turned out to be particularly useful for the study of differential and integral equations . The usage of the word functional as a noun goes back to the calculus of variations , implying a function whose argument is a function . The term was first used in Hadamard 's 1910 book on that subject . However , the general concept of a functional had previously been introduced in 1887 by the Italian mathematician and physicist Vito Volterra . The theory of nonlinear functionals was continued by students of Hadamard , in particular Fr\u00e9chet and L\u00e9vy . Hadamard also founded the modern school of linear functional analysis further developed by Riesz and the group of Polish mathematicians around Stefan Banach . In modern introductory texts to functional analysis , the subject is seen as the study of vector spaces endowed with a topology , in particular infinite-dimensional spaces .",

The concept of a group is central to abstract algebra : other well-known algebraic structures , such as rings , fields , and vector spaces , can all be seen as groups endowed with additional operations and axioms .

Linear algebraic groups and Lie groups are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right . Various physical systems , such as crystals and the hydrogen atom , may be modelled by symmetry groups . Thus group theory and the closely related representation theory have many important applications in physics , chemistry , and materials science . Group theory is also central to public key cryptography . One of the most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century was the collaborative effort , taking up more than 10,000 journal pages and mostly published between 1960 and 1980 , that culminated in a complete classification of finite simple groups .",

The camps became a major site of the Nazis ' Final Solution to the Jewish Question . After Germany sparked World War II by invading Poland in September 1939 , the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) converted Auschwitz I , an army barracks , into a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish political prisoners . The first inmates , German criminals brought to the camp in May 1940 as functionaries , established the camp 's reputation for sadism , beating , torturing , and executing prisoners for the most trivial reasons . The first gassings - of Soviet and Polish prisoners - took place in block 11 of Auschwitz I around August 1941 . Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month , and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over German-occupied Europe to its gas chambers .

After the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 , Lviv became part of the Soviet Union , and in 1944-46 there was a population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine . In 1991 , it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine . Administratively , Lviv serves as the administrative centre of Lviv Oblast and has the status of city of oblast significance . Lviv was the centre of the historical regions of Red Ruthenia and Galicia . The historical heart of the city , with its old buildings and cobblestone streets , survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed .",

Head of the Mathematics Faculty on the Lw\u00f3w University of Technology . He was arrested and murdered together with his two sons : the 29-year-old engineer Eustachy and 24-year-old Emanuel , graduate of the Institute of Technology by Nazis during the Second World War on 3 or 4 July in Lviv , during the Massacre of Lviv professors . In December 1944 , Stefan Banach wrote the following tribute to Sto\u017cek :",
  "/wiki/Alfred_Tauber": "Alfred Tauber ( 5 November 1866 - 26 July 1942 ) was a Hungarian-born Austrian mathematician , known for his contribution to mathematical analysis and to the theory of functions of a complex variable : he is the eponym of an important class of theorems with applications ranging from mathematical and harmonic analysis to number theory . He was murdered in the Theresienstadt concentration camp .",
  "/wiki/Abelian_and_tauberian_theorems": "In mathematics , Abelian and Tauberian theorems are theorems giving conditions for two methods of summing divergent series to give the same result , named after Niels Henrik Abel and Alfred Tauber . The original examples are Abel 's theorem showing that if a series converges to some limit then its Abel sum is the same limit , and Tauber 's theorem showing that if the Abel sum of a series exists and the coefficients are sufficiently small ( o ( 1/n ) ) then the series converges to the Abel sum . More general Abelian and Tauberian theorems give similar results for more general summation methods . There is not yet a clear distinction between Abelian and Tauberian theorems , and no generally accepted definition of what these terms mean . Often , a theorem is called Abelian if it shows that some summation method gives the usual sum for convergent series , and is called Tauberian if it gives conditions for a series summable by some method that allows it to be summable in the usual sense ."
