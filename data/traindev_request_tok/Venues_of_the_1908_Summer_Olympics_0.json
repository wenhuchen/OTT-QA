  "/wiki/Southampton_Water": "Southampton Water is a tidal estuary north of the Solent and the Isle of Wight in England . The city of Southampton lies at its most northerly point . Along its salt marsh-fringed western shores lie the New Forest villages of Hythe and the waterside , Dibden Bay , and the Esso oil refinery at Fawley . On the slightly steeper eastern shore are the Southampton suburb of Weston , the villages of Netley and Hamble-le-Rice , and the Royal Victoria Country Park . Together with the Solent , Southampton Water is world-renowned for yachting . It served as one of the sailing and motorboating venues for the 1908 Summer Olympics . Geographically , Southampton Water is classified as a ria , or drowned valley , of the English Channel . It was formed by the rivers Test , Itchen and Hamble which flow into it , and became an inlet of the sea at the end of the last ice age when sea levels rose , flooding many valleys in the south of England . In particular , it is likely that Southampton Water formed partly due to the submerging of the River Solent which previously flowed through the area , and of which the River Test , River Itchen and River Medina are thought to be tributaries . Southampton 's emergence as a major port , and particularly as a port handling very large vessels , depended partly on certain geographical features of Southampton Water . Its depth , even in its undeveloped state , was generous ; this depth of water has been increased over the years with comparative ease since the soft silt of the river-bed allows for easy dredging . An additional factor is the phenomenon of the double tide , which results in unusually prolonged periods of high water .",
