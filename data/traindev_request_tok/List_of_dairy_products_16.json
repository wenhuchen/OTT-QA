[ XIII ] The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . It is bordered by Belgium , Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast , Switzerland and Italy to the east , and Andorra and Spain to the south . The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . The country 's 18 integral regions ( five of which are situated overseas ) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres ( 248,573 sq mi ) and a total population of 67.02 million ( as of July 2019 [ update ] ) . France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Other major urban areas include Lyon , Marseille , Toulouse , Bordeaux , Lille and Nice . France , including its overseas territories , has the most number of time zones of any country , with a total of 12 . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . Rome annexed the area in 51 BC , holding it until the arrival of Germanic Franks in 476 , who formed the Kingdom of Francia . The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia , Middle Francia and West Francia . West Francia , which became the Kingdom of France in 987 , emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , following its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337-1453 ) .",

  "/wiki/Dessert": "Dessert ( /d\u026a\u02c8z\u025c\u02d0rt/ ) is a course that concludes a meal . The course usually consists of sweet foods , such as confections dishes or fruit , and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine or liqueur ; however , in the United States it may include coffee , cheeses , nuts , or other savory items regarded as a separate course elsewhere . In some parts of the world , such as much of central and western Africa , and most parts of China , there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal . The term dessert can apply to many confections , such as biscuits , cakes , cookies , custards , gelatins , ice creams , pastries , pies , puddings , sweet soups , and tarts . Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness . Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts .",
  "/wiki/Custard": "Custard is a variety of culinary preparations based on milk or cream cooked with egg yolk to thicken it , and sometimes also flour , corn starch , or gelatin . Depending on the recipe , custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce ( cr\u00e8me anglaise ) to the thick pastry cream ( cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re ) used to fill \u00e9clairs . The most common custards are used in desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla , however savory custards are also found , e.g. , in quiche . Custard is usually cooked in a double boiler ( bain-marie ) , or heated very gently in a saucepan on a stove , though custard can also be steamed , baked in the oven with or without a water bath , or even cooked in a pressure cooker . Custard preparation is a delicate operation , because a temperature increase of 3-6 \u00b0C ( 5-10 \u00b0F ) leads to overcooking and curdling . Generally , a fully cooked custard should not exceed 80 \u00b0C ( ~175 \u00b0F ) ; it begins setting at 70 \u00b0C ( ~160 \u00b0F ) . A water bath slows heat transfer and makes it easier to remove the custard from the oven before it curdles . Adding a small amount of cornflour to the egg-sugar mixture stabilises the resulting custard , allowing it to be cooked in a single pan as well as in a double-boiler . A sous-vide water bath may be used to precisely control temperature .",
  "/wiki/Mousse": "A mousse ( /\u02c8mu\u02d0s/ ; French : [ mus ] ; foam ) is a soft prepared food that incorporates air bubbles to give it a light and airy texture . It can range from light and fluffy to creamy and thick , depending on preparation techniques . A mousse may be sweet or savory . Sweet mousses are typically made with whipped egg whites , whipped cream , or both , and flavored with one or more of chocolate , coffee , caramel , pur\u00e9ed fruits , or various herbs and spices , such as mint or vanilla . In the case of some chocolate mousses , egg yolks are often stirred into melted chocolate to give the final product a richer mouthfeel . Mousses are also typically chilled before being served , which gives them a denser texture . Sweetened mousse is served as a dessert , or used as an airy cake filling . It is sometimes stabilized with gelatin . Savory mousses can be made from meat , fish , shellfish , foie gras , cheese , or vegetables . Hot mousses often get their light texture from the addition of beaten egg whites .",

It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa , Tamang , Qiang , Sherpa , and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people . Tibet is the highest region on Earth , with an average elevation of 5,000 m ( 16,000 ft ) . The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest , Earth 's highest mountain , rising 8,848 m ( 29,029 ft ) above sea level . The Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century , but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories . The bulk of western and central Tibet ( \u00dc-Tsang ) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa , Shigatse , or nearby locations ; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship . Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing , with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders . The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure , being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups , while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo ; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai . The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century . Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912 , Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area ( \u00dc-Tsang ) . The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government . Later , Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang , China .",
  "/wiki/Tibetan_cuisine": "Tibetan cuisine includes the culinary traditions and practices and its peoples .

Vegetarianism has been debated by religious practitioners since the 11th century , but is not prevalent due to the difficulty of growing vegetables , and cultural traditions promoting consumption of meat . Crops must be able to grow at high altitudes , although a few areas are at low enough altitude to grow crops such as rice , oranges , bananas and lemons . The most important crop is barley . Flour milled from roasted barley , called tsampa , is the staple food of Tibet , as well as Sha phaley ( meat and cabbage in bread ) . Balep is Tibetan bread eaten for breakfast and lunch . Various other types of balep bread and fried pies are consumed . Thukpa is a dinner staple consisting of vegetables , meat and noodles of various shapes in broth .

Numbering a little over one billion , domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep . An adult female is referred to as a ewe ( /ju\u02d0/ ) , an intact male as a ram , occasionally a tup , a castrated male as a wether , and a young sheep is a lamb . Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia and one of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes , sheep are raised for fleeces , meat ( lamb , hogget or mutton ) and milk . A sheep 's wool is the most widely used animal fiber , and is usually harvested by shearing . Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones in Commonwealth countries , and lamb in the United States ( including from adults ) . Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today , and are also occasionally raised for pelts , as dairy animals , or as model organisms for science . Sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world , and has been fundamental to many civilizations . In the modern era , Australia , New Zealand , the southern and central South American nations , and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production .

Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south , the Arabian Sea on the southwest , and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast , it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west ; [ e ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north ; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east . In the Indian Ocean , India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago . Their long occupation , initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers , has made the region highly diverse , second only to Africa in human genetic diversity . Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago , evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE . By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest , unfolding as the language of the Rigveda , and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India . The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions . By 400 BCE , stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism , and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen , proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity . Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin . Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity , but also marked by the declining status of women , and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief .",

Given the range of diversity in soil type , climate , culture , ethnic groups , and occupations , these cuisines vary substantially from each other and use locally available spices , herbs , vegetables , and fruits . Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion , in particular Hinduism , cultural choices and traditions . The cuisine is also influenced by centuries of Islamic rule , particularly the Mughal rule . Samosas and pilafs can be regarded as examples . Historical events such as foreign invasions , trade relations , and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country . The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India . A number of these such as the potato , tomatoes , chillies , peanuts , and Guava have become staples in many regions of India . Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations ; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe 's Age of Discovery .

  "/wiki/Strained_yogurt": "Strained yogurt , Greek yogurt , yogurt cheese , or sack yoghurt is yogurt that has been strained to remove most of its whey , resulting in a thicker consistency than unstrained yogurt , while preserving yogurt 's distinctive sour taste . Like many types of yogurt , strained yogurt is often made from milk that has been enriched by boiling off some of its water content , or by adding extra butterfat and powdered milk . In Europe and North America , it is often made from low-fat or fat-free milk . In Iceland , a similar product named skyr is made . Strained yogurt is generally marketed in North America as Greek yogurt and in Britain as Greek-style yoghurt , though strained yogurt is also widely eaten in Levantine , Eastern Mediterranean , Middle Eastern , Central Asian and South Asian cuisines , wherein it is often used in cooking ( as it is high enough in fat content to avoid curdling at higher temperatures ) . Such dishes may be cooked or raw , savoury or sweet . Due to the straining process to remove excess whey , even non-fat varieties of strained yogurt are much thicker , richer , and creamier than yogurts that have not been strained . Since the straining process removes the whey , or fluid , from the milk solids , it requires substantially more plain yogurt to produce a cup of strained yogurt , so the cost to make it is increased accordingly . Thickeners , such as pectin , locust bean gum , starches or guar gum , listed in the ingredients indicate straining was not the method used to consolidate the milk solids . Marketing of Greek or Greek-style yogurt in the United States allows the use of more thickeners instead of straining , so there is little difference between the yogurt of years prior to the introduction of strained yogurt other than an increase of thickeners , even though the price is now higher for the original , unstrained products . In western Europe and the US , strained yogurt has increased in popularity compared to unstrained yogurt . Since the straining process removes some of the lactose , strained yogurt is lower in sugar than unstrained yogurt .",

[ d ] The capital and largest city is Reykjav\u00edk . Reykjavik and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population . Iceland is volcanically and geologically active . The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields , mountains , and glaciers , and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands . Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate , despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle . Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly , with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate . According to the ancient manuscript Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k , the settlement of Iceland began in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ing\u00f3lfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island . In the following centuries , Norwegians , and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians , emigrated to Iceland , bringing with them thralls ( i.e. , slaves or serfs ) of Gaelic origin . The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing , one of the world 's oldest functioning legislative assemblies .

It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose . Interspecies consumption of milk is not uncommon , particularly among humans , many of whom consume the milk of other mammals . As an agricultural product , milk , also called dairy milk , is extracted from farm animals during or soon after pregnancy . Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011 , from 260 million dairy cows . India is the world 's largest producer of milk , and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder , yet it exports few other milk products . The ever-increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future . New Zealand , Germany and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products .

In many countries , it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content . It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets , and contains high levels of saturated fat . Cream skimmed from milk may be called sweet cream to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey , a by-product of cheese-making . Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty , tangy and cheesy . In many countries , cream is usually sold partially fermented : sour cream , cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche , and so on . Both forms have many culinary uses in sweet , bitter , salty and tangy dishes .

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east , and spans more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,900 mi ) along the coast of the continent from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea in the south . Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , Japan encompasses a stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands , with five main islands ( Hokkaido , Honshu , Kyushu , Shikoku , and Okinawa ) comprising 97% of the country 's total area of 377,975 square kilometers ( 145,937 sq mi ) . Japan is officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions . Approximately two-thirds of the country 's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested , and less than one-eighth of land is suitable for agriculture . Consequently , Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world , with over 90% of its population living in urban areas . The largest of these is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo , which is the most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people .

Milk film can be produced both through conventional boiling and by microwaving the liquid , and as such can often be observed when heating milk for use in drinks such as drinking chocolate . It is caused by the denaturation of proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin ( whey protein ) . When milk is boiled , soluble milk proteins are denatured and then coagulate with milk 's fat and form a sticky film across the top of the liquid , which then dries by evaporation . The layer does not need to be discarded and can be consumed , as protein 's nutritional value is unaffected by the denaturation process . Milk film is often considered to be desirable and is used in several recipes for various foods .",

With soft serve , this is accomplished by a special machine that holds pre-mixed product at a very low , but non-frozen temperature , at the point of sale .",
  "/wiki/United_States": "The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .",
  "/wiki/Ice_cream": "Ice cream ( derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice ) is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert . It may be made from dairy milk or cream and is flavored with a sweetener , either sugar or an alternative , and any spice , such as cocoa or vanilla . Colourings are usually added , in addition to stabilizers . The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming . The result is a smooth , semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures ( below 2 \u00b0C or 35 \u00b0F ) . It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases . The meaning of the name ice cream varies from one country to another . Terms such as frozen custard , frozen yogurt , sorbet , gelato , and others are used to distinguish different varieties and styles . In some countries , such as the United States , ice cream applies only to a specific variety , and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients , notably the amount of cream . Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled frozen dairy dessert instead . In other countries , such as Italy and Argentina , one word is used for all variants . Analogues made from dairy alternatives , such as goat 's or sheep 's milk , or milk substitutes ( e.g. , soy , cashew , coconut , almond milk or tofu ) , are available for those who are lactose intolerant , allergic to dairy protein , or vegan .",
  "/wiki/Sour_cream": "Sour cream ( American English ) or soured cream ( British English ) is a dairy product obtained by fermenting regular cream with certain kinds of lactic acid bacteria . The bacterial culture , which is introduced either deliberately or naturally , sours and thickens the cream . Its name comes from the production of lactic acid by bacterial fermentation , which is called souring .",
  "/wiki/Fermentation_in_food_processing": "Fermentation in food processing is the process of converting carbohydrates to alcohol or organic acids using microorganisms - yeasts or bacteria - under anaerobic conditions . Fermentation usually implies that the action of microorganisms is desired . The science of fermentation is known as zymology or zymurgy . The term fermentation sometimes refers specifically to the chemical conversion of sugars into ethanol , producing alcoholic drinks such as wine , beer , and cider . However , similar processes take place in the leavening of bread ( CO2 produced by yeast activity ) , and in the preservation of sour foods with the production of lactic acid , such as in sauerkraut and yogurt . Other widely consumed fermented foods include vinegar , olives , and cheese . More localised foods prepared by fermentation may also be based on beans , grain , vegetables , fruit , honey , dairy products , fish .",
  "/wiki/Cream": "Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization . In un-homogenized milk , the fat , which is less dense , eventually rises to the top . In the industrial production of cream , this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called separators . In many countries , it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content . It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets , and contains high levels of saturated fat . Cream skimmed from milk may be called sweet cream to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey , a by-product of cheese-making . Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty , tangy and cheesy . In many countries , cream is usually sold partially fermented : sour cream , cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche , and so on . Both forms have many culinary uses in sweet , bitter , salty and tangy dishes . Cream produced by cattle ( particularly Jersey cattle ) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat ; this gives it a slightly yellow tone , hence the name of the yellowish-white color : cream . This is also the origin of butter 's yellow color . Cream from goat 's milk , or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets , is white .",
  "/wiki/Lactic_acid_bacteria": "Lactic acid bacteria ( LAB ) are an order of gram-positive , low-GC , acid-tolerant , generally nonsporulating , nonrespiring , either rod-shaped ( bacilli ) or spherical ( cocci ) bacteria that share common metabolic and physiological characteristics . These bacteria , usually found in decomposing plants and milk products , produce lactic acid as the major metabolic end product of carbohydrate fermentation . This trait has , throughout history , linked LAB with food fermentations , as acidification inhibits the growth of spoilage agents . Proteinaceous bacteriocins are produced by several LAB strains and provide an additional hurdle for spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms . Furthermore , lactic acid and other metabolic products contribute to the organoleptic and textural profile of a food item . The industrial importance of the LAB is further evidenced by their generally recognized as safe ( GRAS ) status , due to their ubiquitous appearance in food and their contribution to the healthy microbiota of animal and human mucosal surfaces . The genera that comprise the LAB are at its core Lactobacillus , Leuconostoc , Pediococcus , Lactococcus , and Streptococcus , as well as the more peripheral Aerococcus , Carnobacterium , Enterococcus , Oenococcus , Sporolactobacillus , Tetragenococcus , Vagococcus , and Weissella ; these belong to the order Lactobacillales .",
  "/wiki/Bacterial_culture": "A microbiological culture , or microbial culture , is a method of multiplying microbial organisms by letting them reproduce in predetermined culture medium under controlled laboratory conditions . Microbial cultures are foundational and basic diagnostic methods used as a research tool in molecular biology . Microbial cultures are used to determine the type of organism , its abundance in the sample being tested , or both . It is one of the primary diagnostic methods of microbiology and used as a tool to determine the cause of infectious disease by letting the agent multiply in a predetermined medium . For example , a throat culture is taken by scraping the lining of tissue in the back of the throat and blotting the sample into a medium to be able to screen for harmful microorganisms , such as Streptococcus pyogenes , the causative agent of strep throat . Furthermore , the term culture is more generally used informally to refer to selectively growing a specific kind of microorganism in the lab . It is often essential to isolate a pure culture of microorganisms . A pure ( or axenic ) culture is a population of cells or multicellular organisms growing in the absence of other species or types . A pure culture may originate from a single cell or single organism , in which case the cells are genetic clones of one another . For the purpose of gelling the microbial culture , the medium of agarose gel ( agar ) is used . Agar is a gelatinous substance derived from seaweed . A cheap substitute for agar is guar gum , which can be used for the isolation and maintenance of thermophiles .",
  "/wiki/Soured_milk": "Soured milk denotes a range of food products produced by the acidification of milk . Acidification , which gives the milk a tart taste , is achieved either through bacterial fermentation or through the addition of an acid , such as lemon juice or vinegar . The acid causes milk to coagulate and thicken , inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria and improving the product 's shelf life . Soured milk that is produced by bacterial fermentation is more specifically called fermented milk or cultured milk . Traditionally , soured milk was simply fresh milk that was left to ferment and sour by keeping it in a warm place for a day , often near a stove . Modern commercial soured milk may differ from milk that has become sour naturally . [ full citation needed ] Soured milk that is produced by the addition of an acid , with or without the addition of microbial organisms , is more specifically called acidified milk . In the United States , acids used to manufacture acidified milk include acetic acid ( commonly found in vinegar ) , adipic acid , citric acid ( commonly found in lemon juice ) , fumaric acid , glucono-delta-lactone , hydrochloric acid , lactic acid , malic acid , phosphoric acid , succinic acid , and tartaric acid . Soured milk is commonly made at home or is sold and consumed in Europe , especially in Eastern Europe ( Bulgaria , Belarus , Poland , Slovakia , Russia , Ukraine ) , all over the countries of the former Yugoslavia ( Macedonia , Serbia , Montenegro , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Slovenia ) , Romania , Greece , Finland , Germany , and Scandinavia . It is also made at home or sold in supermarkets and consumed in the Great Lakes region of Somalia and Eastern Africa ( Kenya , Uganda , Rwanda , Burundi and Tanzania ) . It is also a traditional food of the Bantu people of Southern Africa . Since the 1970s , some producers have used chemical acidification in place of biological agents .",
  "/wiki/Fermentation": "Fermentation is a metabolic process that produces chemical changes in organic substrates through the action of enzymes . In biochemistry , it is narrowly defined as the extraction of energy from carbohydrates in the absence of respiration . In the context of food production , it may more broadly refer to any process in which the activity of microorganisms brings about a desirable change to a foodstuff or beverage . The science of fermentation is known as zymology . In microorganisms , fermentation is the primary means of producing adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) by the degradation of organic nutrients anaerobically . Humans have used fermentation to produce foodstuffs and beverages since the Neolithic age . For example , fermentation is used for preservation in a process that produces lactic acid found in such sour foods as pickled cucumbers , kombucha , kimchi , and yogurt , as well as for producing alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer . Fermentation also occurs within the gastrointestinal tracts of all animals , including humans .",
  "/wiki/Spaghettieis": "Spaghettieis ( German pronunciation : [ \u0283pa\u02c8\u0261\u025bti\u02cca\u026as ] ) is a German ice cream dish made to look like a plate of spaghetti . In the dish , vanilla ice cream is extruded through a modified Sp\u00e4tzle press or potato ricer , giving it the appearance of spaghetti . It is then placed over whipped cream and topped with strawberry sauce ( to simulate tomato sauce ) and either coconut flakes , grated almonds , or white chocolate shavings to represent the parmesan cheese . Besides the usual dish with strawberry sauce , one may also find variations like ice cream with dark chocolate ice cream and nuts , simulating Spaghetti Carbonara instead of Spaghetti Bolognese . Spaghettieis was created by Dario Fontanella in the late 1960s in Mannheim , Germany . Fontanella recalls serving his innovative creation to children who broke into tears because they wanted ice cream and not a plate of spaghetti . He received the Bloomaulorden , a medal bestowed by the city of Mannheim , in 2014 . For many years , the dish was not well known outside Germany , and could only be found at some gelaterias and specialty ice cream parlors , special events , and hotels and restaurants around the world . Recently , Spaghettieis has begun to appear as a novelty in more restaurants and has had some attention on social media [ citation needed ] .",
