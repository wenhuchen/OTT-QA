These systems preferentially guarantee growth of plasmid-carrying daughter cells in a bacterial population by killing newborn bacteria that have not inherited a plasmid copy at cell division ( post-segregational killing ) . The ccd system ( control of cell death ) of the F plasmid encodes two proteins , the CcdB protein ( 101 amino acids ; toxin ) and the CcdA antidote ( 72 amino acids ) . The antidote prevents CcdB toxicity by forming a tight CcdA-CcdB complex .",
  "/wiki/Escherichia_coli": "Escherichia coli ( /\u02cc\u025b\u0283\u0259\u02c8r\u026aki\u0259 \u02c8ko\u028ala\u026a/ ) , also known as E. coli ( /\u02cci\u02d0 \u02c8ko\u028ala\u026a/ ) , is a Gram-negative , facultative anaerobic , rod-shaped , coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms ( endotherms ) . Most E. coli strains are harmless , but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts , and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination . The harmless strains are part of the normal microbiota of the gut , and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2 , ( which helps blood to clot ) and preventing colonisation of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria , having a symbiotic relationship . E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter . The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days , but its numbers decline slowly afterwards . E. coli and other facultative anaerobes constitute about 0.1% of gut microbiota , and fecal-oral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease . Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time , which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination . A growing body of research , though , has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for and grow outside a host . The bacterium can be grown and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting , and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years . E. coli is a chemoheterotroph whose chemically defined medium must include a source of carbon and energy . E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism , and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology , where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA . Under favorable conditions , it takes as little as 20 minutes to reproduce .",
  "/wiki/ParDE_type_II_toxin-antitoxin_system": "The parDE type II toxin-antitoxin system is one example of the bacterial toxin-antitoxin ( TA ) systems that encode two proteins , one a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation ( toxin ) and the other its specific antidote ( antitoxin ) . These systems preferentially guarantee growth of plasmid-carrying daughter cells in a bacterial population by killing newborn bacteria that have not inherited a plasmid copy at cell division ( post-segregational killing ) . ParD is a plasmid anti-toxin that forms a ribbon-helix-helix DNA binding structure . It stabilises plasmids by inhibiting ParE toxicity in cells that express ParD and ParE . ParD forms a dimer and also regulates its own promoter ( parDE ) . As with CcdB the toxin target is DNA gyrase . Induction of ParE toxin results in inhibition of cell division but not cell growth . The parD and ccD systems are found to be strikingly similar in terms of their structures and actions . The antitoxin protein of each system interacts with its cognate toxin to neutralise the activity of the toxin and in the process the complex of the two becomes an efficient transcription repressor .",
  "/wiki/Copy-number_variation": "Copy number variation ( CNV ) is a phenomenon in which sections of the genome are repeated and the number of repeats in the genome varies between individuals . Copy number variation is a type of structural variation : specifically , it is a type of duplication or deletion event that affects a considerable number of base pairs . However , note that although modern genomics research is mostly focused on human genomes , copy number variations also occur in a variety of other organisms including E. coli and S. cerevisiae . Recent research indicates that approximately two thirds of the entire human genome is composed of repeats and 4.8-9.5% of the human genome can be classified as copy number variations . In mammals , copy number variations play an important role in generating necessary variation in the population as well as disease phenotype . Copy number variations can be generally categorized into two main groups : short repeats and long repeats . However , there are no clear boundaries between the two groups and the classification depends on the nature of the loci of interest . Short repeats include mainly bi-nucleotide repeats ( two repeating nucleotides e.g . A-C-A-C-A-C. ) and tri-nucleotide repeats . Long repeats include repeats of entire genes . This classification based on size of the repeat is the most obvious type of classification as size is an important factor in examining the types of mechanisms that most likely gave rise to the repeats , hence the likely effects of these repeats on phenotype .",
  "/wiki/Caulobacter_crescentus": "Caulobacter crescentus is a Gram-negative , oligotrophic bacterium widely distributed in fresh water lakes and streams . Caulobacter is an important model organism for studying the regulation of the cell cycle , asymmetric cell division , and cellular differentiation . Caulobacter daughter cells have two very different forms . One daughter is a mobile swarmer cell that has a single flagellum at one cell pole that provides swimming motility for chemotaxis . The other daughter , called the stalked cell , has a tubular stalk structure protruding from one pole that has an adhesive holdfast material on its end , with which the stalked cell can adhere to surfaces . Swarmer cells differentiate into stalked cells after a short period of motility . Chromosome replication and cell division only occurs in the stalked cell stage . Its name derives from its crescent shape caused by the protein crescentin , discovered by Christine Jacobs-Wagner 's laboratory . Its use as a model originated with developmental biologist Lucy Shapiro .",
  "/wiki/Chromosome": "A chromosome is a deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) molecule with part or all of the genetic material ( genome ) of an organism . Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins which , aided by chaperone proteins , bind to and condense the DNA molecule to prevent it from becoming an unmanageable tangle . This three-dimensional genome structure plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation . Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division ( where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form ) . Before this happens , every chromosome is copied once ( S phase ) , and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere , resulting either in an X-shaped structure ( pictured here ) if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends . The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids . During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome . In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study . In animal cells , chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during chromosome segregation . Chromosomal recombination during meiosis and subsequent sexual reproduction play a significant role in genetic diversity . If these structures are manipulated incorrectly , through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation , the cell may undergo mitotic catastrophe . Usually , this will make the cell initiate apoptosis leading to its own death , but sometimes mutations in the cell hamper this process and thus cause progression of cancer .",
  "/wiki/Archaea": "Archaea ( /\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8ki\u02d0\u0259/ ( listen ) or /\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8ke\u026a\u0259/ ar-KEE-\u0259 or ar-KAY-\u0259 ) ( singular archaeon ) constitute a domain of single-celled organisms . These microorganisms lack cell nuclei and are therefore prokaryotes . Archaea were initially classified as bacteria , receiving the name archaebacteria ( in the Archaebacteria kingdom ) , but this classification is outmoded . They have been renamed to clarify that archaea are not only not bacteria , but are more closely related to eukaryotes ( life whose cells can have a nucleus , including humans ) than to real bacteria . Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains , Bacteria and Eukaryota . Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla . Classification is difficult because most have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment . Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape , although a few archaea have very different shapes , such as the flat and square cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi . Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria , archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes , notably for the enzymes involved in transcription and translation . Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique , such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes , including archaeols . Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes : these range from organic compounds , such as sugars , to ammonia , metal ions or even hydrogen gas . Salt-tolerant archaea ( the Haloarchaea ) use sunlight as an energy source , and other species of archaea fix carbon , but unlike plants and cyanobacteria , no known species of archaea does both .",

It 's known as a low copy plasmid , meaning that it exists in relatively few copies in any given bacteria . Because of its low copy nature , R1 must rely on type II segregation system to ensure that at least one copy is contained in each daughter cell after cell division .

  "/wiki/Zeta_toxin_protein_domain": "In molecular biology , the protein domain Zeta ( \u03b6 ) toxin refers to a protein domain found in prokaryotes , which acts as a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine kinase . Its function is to inhibit cell wall biosynthesis and it may act as a bactericide in nature . It is also thought that Zeta toxin induces reversible protective dormancy and permeation to propidium iodide ( PI ) .",
  "/wiki/Gram-positive_bacteria": "Gram-positive bacteria are bacteria that give a positive result in the Gram stain test , which is traditionally used to quickly classify bacteria into two broad categories according to their cell wall . Gram-positive bacteria take up the crystal violet stain used in the test , and then appear to be purple-coloured when seen through an optical microscope . This is because the thick peptidoglycan layer in the bacterial cell wall retains the stain after it is washed away from the rest of the sample , in the decolorization stage of the test . Gram-negative bacteria can not retain the violet stain after the decolorization step ; alcohol used in this stage degrades the outer membrane of gram-negative cells , making the cell wall more porous and incapable of retaining the crystal violet stain . Their peptidoglycan layer is much thinner and sandwiched between an inner cell membrane and a bacterial outer membrane , causing them to take up the counterstain ( safranin or fuchsine ) and appear red or pink . Despite their thicker peptidoglycan layer , gram-positive bacteria are more receptive to certain cell wall targeting antibiotics than gram-negative bacteria , due to the absence of the outer membrane .",

When infecting humans , they often cause gastroenteritis , enterocolitis , and bloody diarrhea ( hence the name enterohemorrhagic ) and sometimes cause a severe complication called hemolytic-uremic syndrome ( HUS ) . The group and its subgroups are known by various names . They are distinguished from other strains of intestinal pathogenic E. coli including enterotoxigenic E. coli ( ETEC ) , enteropathogenic E. coli ( EPEC ) , enteroinvasive E. coli ( EIEC ) , enteroaggregative E. coli ( EAEC ) , and diffusely adherent E. coli ( DAEC ) .",
  "/wiki/Klebsiella": "Klebsiella is a genus of Gram-negative , oxidase-negative , rod-shaped bacteria with a prominent polysaccharide-based capsule . Klebsiella species are found everywhere in nature . This is thought to be due to distinct sublineages developing specific niche adaptations , with associated biochemical adaptations which make them better suited to a particular environment . They can be found in water , soil , plants , insects and other animals including humans . Klebsiella is named after German-Swiss microbiologist Edwin Klebs ( 1834-1913 ) . Carl Friedlander described Klebsiella bacillus which is why it was termed Friedlander bacillus for many years . The members of the genus Klebsiella are a part of the human and animal 's normal flora in the nose , mouth and intestines . The species of Klebsiella are all gram-negative and usually non-motile . They tend to be shorter and thicker when compared to others in the family Enterobacteriaceae . The cells are rods in shape and generally measures 0.3 to 1.5 \u00b5m wide by 0.5 to 5.0 \u00b5m long . They can be found singly , in pairs , in chains or linked end to end . Klebsiella can grow on ordinary lab medium and do not have special growth requirements , like the other members of Enterobacteriaceae ."
