  "/wiki/Devon": "Devon ( /\u02c8d\u025bv\u0259n/ ) , also known as Devonshire , is a county of England , reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south . It is part of South West England , bounded by Cornwall to the west , Somerset to the north east , and Dorset to the east . The city of Exeter is the county town . The county includes the districts of East Devon , Mid Devon , North Devon , South Hams , Teignbridge , Torridge , and West Devon . Plymouth and Torbay are each geographically part of Devon , but are administered as unitary authorities . Combined as a ceremonial county , Devon 's area is 6,707 km2 ( 2,590 square miles ) and its population is about 1.1 million . Devon derives its name from Dumnonia . During the British Iron Age , Roman Britain , and the early Middle Ages , this was the homeland of the Dumnonii Brittonic Celts . ( The shift from M to V is a typical Celtic consonant shift . ) The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain resulted in the partial assimilation of Dumnonia into the Kingdom of Wessex during the eighth and ninth centuries . The western boundary with Cornwall was set at the River Tamar by King \u00c6thelstan in 936 . Devon was later constituted as a shire of the Kingdom of England .",
  "/wiki/Victorian_restoration": "The Victorian restoration was the widespread and extensive refurbishment and rebuilding of Church of England churches and cathedrals that took place in England and Wales during the 19th-century reign of Queen Victoria . It was not the same process as is understood today by the term building restoration . Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings ; a reaction against the Puritan ethic manifested in the Gothic Revival ; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities , the Cambridge Camden Society and the Oxford Movement advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing . The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in church attendance . The principle was to restore a church to how it might have looked during the Decorated style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360 , and many famous architects such as George Gilbert Scott and Ewan Christian enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations . It is estimated that around 80% of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement , varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding . Influential people like John Ruskin and William Morris were opposed to such large-scale restoration , and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation , such as the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . In retrospect , the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light .",
  "/wiki/Norwich_Cathedral": "Norwich Cathedral is an English cathedral located in Norwich , Norfolk , dedicated to the Holy and Undivided Trinity . It is the cathedral church for the Church of England Diocese of Norwich and is one of the Norwich 12 heritage sites . The cathedral was begun in 1096 and constructed out of flint and mortar and faced with a cream-coloured Caen limestone . An Anglo-Saxon settlement and two churches were demolished to make room for the buildings . The cathedral was completed in 1145 with the Norman tower still seen today topped with a wooden spire covered with lead . Several episodes of damage necessitated rebuilding of the east end and spire but since the final erection of the stone spire in 1480 there have been few fundamental alterations to the fabric . The large cloister has over 1,000 bosses including several hundred carved and ornately painted ones . Norwich Cathedral has the second largest cloisters in England , only exceeded by those at Salisbury Cathedral . The cathedral close is one of the largest in England and one of the largest in Europe and has more people living within it than any other close . The cathedral spire , measuring at 315 ft ( 96 m ) , is the second-tallest in England despite being partly rebuilt after being struck by lightning in 1169 , just 23 months after its completion , which led to the building being set on fire . Measuring 461 ft ( 141 m ) long and , with the transepts , 177 ft ( 54 m ) wide at completion , Norwich Cathedral was the largest building in East Anglia . There is no entry charge to visit the cathedral ; visitors are instead asked to make a suggested voluntary donation to help cover the costs of running the cathedral each year .",

  "/wiki/Chancel": "In church architecture , the chancel is the space around the altar , including the choir and the sanctuary ( sometimes called the presbytery ) , at the liturgical east end of a traditional Christian church building . It may terminate in an apse . It is generally the area used by the clergy and choir during worship , while the congregation is in the nave . Direct access may be provided by a priest 's door , usually on the south side of the church . This is one definition , sometimes called the strict one ; in practice in churches where the eastern end contains other elements such as an ambulatory and side chapels , these are also often counted as part of the chancel , especially when discussing architecture . In smaller churches , where the altar is backed by the outside east wall and there is no distinct choir , the chancel and sanctuary may be the same area . In churches with a retroquire area behind the altar , this may only be included in the broader definition of chancel . In a cathedral or other large church , there may be a distinct choir area at the start of the chancel ( looking from the nave ) , before reaching the sanctuary , and an ambulatory may run beside and behind it . All these may be included in the chancel , at least in architectural terms ( see above ) . In many churches , the altar has now been moved to the front of the chancel , in what was built as the choir area , or to the centre of the transept , somewhat confusing the distinction between chancel , choir and sanctuary . In churches with less traditional plans , the term may not be useful in either architectural or ecclesiastical terms . The chancel may be a step or two higher than the level of the nave , and the sanctuary is often raised still further .",

  "/wiki/Vestry": "A vestry was a committee for the local secular and ecclesiastical government for a parish in England and Wales , which originally met in the vestry or sacristy of the parish church , and consequently became known colloquially as the vestry . For many centuries the vestries were the sole de facto local government and presided over local , communal fundraising and expenditure until the mid or late 19th century with local Established Church chairmanship . More punitive matters tended to be dealt with by the manorial court and hundred court during the epoch of the vestries . Their initial power derived from custom and was very occasionally ratified by the common law or asserted in statute such as the Elizabethan Poor Law . At the high point of their powers before removal of Poor Law responsibilities in 1834 , the vestries spent not far short of one-fifth of the budget of the British government which derived much of its income from global trade and imperialism . Secular and ecclesiastical aspects of the vestries were separated , for all areas where they had not earlier been , under a reforming statute of 1894 . Their secular duties have been performed in England since then by parish councils or more superior councils , leaving their ecclesiastical duties to the Church of England where they have been performed by parochial church councils ( PCCs ) since 1921 . Realised secularisation of local government was opposed by administrations of the Tory Party preceding the Third Salisbury ministry , the British government led by Lord Salisbury from 1895 to 1900 and several earlier influential High Whigs . A public right in the PCC ( church ) meeting remains in that all Members of an overlapping civil parish can speak at their annual meetings ( which may appoint churchwardens for instance ) . A right to tax by a PCC for church chancel repairs remains as to liable ( apportioned ) local residents and businesses across an apportioned area of many church parishes , in the form of chancel repair liability however in some tithes were replaced by no further such taxation .",
