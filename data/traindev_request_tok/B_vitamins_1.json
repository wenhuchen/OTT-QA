  "/wiki/Thiamine": "Thiamine , also known as thiamin or vitamin B1 , is a vitamin found in food , and manufactured as a dietary supplement and medication . Food sources of thiamine include whole grains , legumes , and some meats and fish . Grain processing removes much of the thiamine content , so in many countries cereals and flours are enriched with thiamine . Supplements and medications are available to treat and prevent thiamine deficiency and disorders that result from it , including beriberi and Wernicke encephalopathy . Other uses include the treatment of maple syrup urine disease and Leigh syndrome . They are typically taken by mouth , but may also be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection . Thiamine supplements are generally well tolerated . Allergic reactions , including anaphylaxis , may occur when repeated doses are given by injection . Thiamine is in the B complex family . It is an essential micronutrient , which can not be made in the body . Thiamine is required for metabolism including that of glucose , amino acids , and lipids . Thiamine was discovered in 1897 , was the first vitamin to be isolated in 1926 , and was first made in 1936 .",

  "/wiki/Chemical_synthesis": "Chemical synthesis is the artificial execution of useful chemical reactions to obtain one or several products . This occurs by physical and chemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions . In modern laboratory uses , the process is reproducible , reliable , and established to work the same in multiple laboratories . A chemical synthesis involves one or more compounds known as reagents or reactants which will undergo a transformation when subjected to certain conditions . Various reaction types can be applied to formulate a desired product . This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel , such as a chemical reactor or a simple round-bottom flask . Many reactions require some form of work-up or purification procedure to isolate the final product . The amount of product produced in a chemical synthesis is the reaction yield , which is typically expressed as a percentage conversion of the limiting reactant . Typically , chemical yields are expressed as a weight in grams ( in a laboratory setting ) or as a percentage of the total theoretical quantity of product that could be produced based on the limiting reagent . A side reaction is an unwanted chemical reaction taking place , reducing the yield of the desired product . The word synthesis was first used by the chemist Hermann Kolbe .",

Niacin is obtained in the diet from a variety of whole and processed foods , with highest contents in fortified packaged foods , tuna , salmon , some vegetable and other animal sources . Some countries require its addition to grains . Supplemental niacin is primarily used to treat high blood cholesterol and pellagra ( niacin deficiency ) . Insufficient amounts of niacin can cause nausea , skin and mouth lesions , anemia , headaches , and tiredness . This lack of niacin may also be observed in pandemic deficiency diseases , which are caused by a lack of five crucial vitamins ( niacin , vitamin C , thiamin , vitamin D , and vitamin A ) and are usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition . Niacin supplementation has not been found useful for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in those already on a statin , but appears to be effective in those not taking a statin . Although niacin and nicotinamide ( niacinamide ) are identical in their vitamin activity , nicotinamide does not have the same pharmacological effects ( lipid-modifying effects ) as niacin . When niacin takes on the -amide group , it does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing . As the precursor for NAD and NADP , niacin is also involved in DNA repair .

  "/wiki/Folic_acid": "Folate , also known as vitamin B9 and folacin , is one of the B vitamins . Manufactured folic acid , which is converted into folate by the body , is used as a dietary supplement and in food fortification as it is more stable during processing and storage . Folate is essential for the body to make DNA and RNA and metabolise amino acids , which are required for cell division . As humans can not make folate , it is required in the diet , making it an essential vitamin . It occurs naturally in many foods . The recommended adult daily intake of folate in the U.S. is 400 micrograms from foods or dietary supplements . Folate in the form of folic acid is used to treat anemia caused by folate deficiency . Folic acid is also used as a supplement by women during pregnancy to reduce the risk of neural tube defects ( NTDs ) in the baby . Low levels in early pregnancy are believed to be the cause of more than half of babies born with NTDs . More than 80 countries use either mandatory or voluntary fortification of certain foods with folic acid as a measure to decrease the rate of NTDs . Long-term supplementation with relatively large amounts of folic acid is associated with small reduction in the risk of stroke and an increased risk of prostate cancer . There are concerns that large amounts of supplemental folic acid can hide vitamin B12 deficiency .",

  "/wiki/Methylcobalamin": "Methylcobalamin ( mecobalamin , MeCbl , or MeB12 ) is a cobalamin , a form of vitamin B12 . It differs from cyanocobalamin in that the cyano group at the cobalt is replaced with a methyl group . Methylcobalamin features an octahedral cobalt ( III ) centre and can be obtained as bright red crystals . From the perspective of coordination chemistry , methylcobalamin is notable as a rare example of a compound that contains metal-alkyl bonds . Nickel-methyl intermediates have been proposed for the final step of methanogenesis . Methylcobalamin is equivalent physiologically to vitamin B12 , and can be used to prevent or treat pathology arising from a lack of vitamin B12 intake ( vitamin B12 deficiency ) . Methylcobalamin is also used in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy , diabetic neuropathy , and as a preliminary treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Methylcobalamin that is ingested is not used directly as a cofactor , but is first converted by MMACHC into cob ( II ) alamin . Cob ( II ) alamin is then later converted into the other 2 forms , adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin for use as cofactors . That is , methylcobalamin is first dealkylated and then regenerated . According to one author , it is important to treat vitamin B12 deficiency with hydroxocobalamin or cyanocobalamin or a combination of adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin , and not methylcobalamin alone ."
