  "/wiki/List_of_merchant_marine_capacity_by_country": "List of merchant navy capacity by flag is a list of the world foremost fleets of registered trading vessels ranked in both gross tonnage ( GT ) and deadweight tonnage ( DWT ) sorted by flag state . The table is based on the annual maritime shipping statistics provided by the British Government and the Department for Transport . It is complete and correct for the year ending 2012 . Statistics are published on an annual basis every September . While countries such as Panama may appear to possess a large merchant navy , this is a result of much of it being managed by foreign overseas companies ( such as those based in the United States ) . This is known as flag of convenience . For example , although the United Kingdom 's merchant navy totals 30.0 million GT and 40.7 million DWT in shipping , actual UK merchant navy interests worldwide consists of 59.4 million GT and 75.2 million DWT in shipping . This largely includes the merchant navies of British Overseas Territories and UK merchant navy interests in former colonies .",

IRISL has been sanctioned by the U.S. , UN , EU and other parties for its role in advancing Iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs . However , the return of the line to the world market was expected by early winter 2016 , as a result of the Iran nuclear deal between Iran , the P5+1/EU3+3 powers , and the EU in August 2015 . IRISL has also announced its plans to become one of the world 's top ten shipping lines by 2020 .",
  "/wiki/Tanker_(ship)": "A tanker ( or tank ship or tankship ) is a ship designed to transport or store liquids or gases in bulk . Major types of tankship include the oil tanker , the chemical tanker , and gas carrier . Tankers also carry commodities such as vegetable oils , molasses and wine . In the United States Navy and Military Sealift Command , a tanker used to refuel other ships is called an oiler ( or replenishment oiler if it can also supply dry stores ) but many other navies use the terms tanker and replenishment tanker .",
  "/wiki/VLCC": "An oil tanker , also known as a petroleum tanker , is a ship designed for the bulk transport of oil or its products . There are two basic types of oil tankers : crude tankers and product tankers . Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries . For example , moving crude oil from oil wells in a producing country to refineries in another country . Product tankers , generally much smaller , are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets . For example , moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations . Oil tankers are often classified by their size as well as their occupation . The size classes range from inland or coastal tankers of a few thousand metric tons of deadweight ( DWT ) to the mammoth ultra large crude carriers ( ULCCs ) of 550,000 DWT . Tankers move approximately 2.0 billion metric tons ( 2.2 billion short tons ) of oil every year . Second only to pipelines in terms of efficiency , the average cost of oil transport by tanker amounts to only US $ 5 to $ 8 per cubic metre ( $ 0.02 to $ 0.03 per US gallon ) . Some specialized types of oil tankers have evolved . One of these is the naval replenishment oiler , a tanker which can fuel a moving vessel .",
  "/wiki/Suezmax": "Suezmax is a naval architecture term for the largest ship measurements capable of transiting the Suez Canal in a laden condition , and is almost exclusively used in reference to tankers . Since the canal has no locks , the only serious limiting factors are beam , draft , and height because of the Suez Canal Bridge .",
  "/wiki/Aframax": "An Aframax ship is an oil tanker smaller than 120,000 metric tonnes . The term is based on the Average Freight Rate Assessment ( AFRA ) , a tanker rate system created in 1954 by Shell Oil to standardise shipping contract terms . Due to their favorable size , Aframax tankers can serve most ports in the world . These vessels serve regions that do not have very large ports or offshore oil terminals to accommodate very large crude carriers and ultra-large crude carriers . Aframax tankers are optimal for short- to medium-haul crude oil transportation . Aframax class tankers are largely used in the basins of the Black Sea , the North Sea , the Caribbean Sea , the South and East China Seas , and the Mediterranean . Non-OPEC exporting countries may require the use of this type of vessel because the harbors and canals through which these countries export their oil are too small to accommodate the larger Suezmax or the larger still very large crude carriers and ultra-large crude carriers .",

The Geneva Convention on Road Traffic entered into force on 26 March 1952 . One of the main benefits of the convention for motorists is the obligation on signatory countries to recognize the legality of vehicles from other signatory countries . When driving in other signatory countries , the distinguishing sign of the country of registration must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle . This sign must be placed separately from the registration plate and may not be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate .

Broad distinctions are useful to avoid ambiguity , and disambiguation will be of varying importance depending on the nuance of the equivalent word in other languages . A first distinction is necessary between maritime shipping routes and waterways used by inland water craft . Maritime shipping routes cross oceans and seas , and some lakes , where navigability is assumed , and no engineering is required , except to provide the draft for deep-sea shipping to approach seaports ( channels ) , or to provide a short cut across an isthmus ; this is the function of ship canals . Dredged channels in the sea are not usually described as waterways . There is an exception to this initial distinction , essentially for legal purposes , see under international waters . Where seaports are located inland , they are approached through a waterway that could be termed inland but in practice is generally referred to as a maritime waterway ( examples Seine Maritime , Loire Maritime , Seeschiffahrtsstra\u00dfe Elbe ) . The term inland waterway refers to navigable rivers and canals designed to be used by inland waterway craft only , implicitly of much smaller dimensions than seagoing ships .

It is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world . The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City ; other main offices are in Geneva , Nairobi , Vienna and The Hague . The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars , succeeding the ineffective League of Nations . On 25 April 1945 , 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter , which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945 , when the UN began operations . Pursuant to the Charter , the organization 's objectives include maintaining international peace and security , protecting human rights , delivering humanitarian aid , promoting sustainable development , and upholding international law . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; this number grew to 193 in 2011 , representing the vast majority of the world 's sovereign states . The organization 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies . Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring , reporting and confidence-building roles . UN membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in the 1960s . Since then , 80 former colonies have gained independence , including 11 trust territories that had been monitored by the Trusteeship Council . By the 1970s , the UN 's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping .",
  "/wiki/Jet_fuel": "Jet fuel , aviation turbine fuel ( ATF ) , or avtur , is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines . It is colorless to straw-colored in appearance . The most commonly used fuels for commercial aviation are Jet A and Jet A-1 , which are produced to a standardized international specification . The only other jet fuel commonly used in civilian turbine-engine powered aviation is Jet B , which is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance . Jet fuel is a mixture of a variety of hydrocarbons . Because the exact composition of jet fuel varies widely based on petroleum source , it is impossible to define jet fuel as a ratio of specific hydrocarbons . Jet fuel is therefore defined as a performance specification rather than a chemical compound . Furthermore , the range of molecular mass between hydrocarbons ( or different carbon numbers ) is defined by the requirements for the product , such as the freezing point or smoke point . Kerosene-type jet fuel ( including Jet A and Jet A-1 , JP-5 , and JP-8 ) has a carbon number distribution between about 8 and 16 ( carbon atoms per molecule ) ; wide-cut or naphtha-type jet fuel ( including Jet B and JP-4 ) , between about 5 and 15 ."
