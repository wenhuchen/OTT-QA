The New Zealand Police also has responsibility for traffic and commercial vehicle enforcement as well as other key responsibilities including protection of dignitaries , firearms licensing and matters of national security . Policing in New Zealand was introduced in 1840 , modelled on similar constabularies that existed in Britain at that time . The constabulary was initially part police and part militia .

The New Zealand Police has generally enjoyed a reputation for mild policing , but there have been cases when the use of force was criticised , such as during the 1981 Springbok tour . The current Minister of Police is Stuart Nash . While the New Zealand Police is a government department with a minister responsible for it , the commissioner and sworn members swear allegiance directly to the Sovereign and , by convention , have constabulary independence from the government of the day .
