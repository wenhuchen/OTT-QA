  "/wiki/Movie": "Film , also called movie or motion picture or ( less widely ) The Seventh Art , is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas , stories , perceptions , feelings , beauty or atmosphere , by the means of recorded or programmed [ vague ] moving images , along with sound ( and more rarely ) other sensory stimulations . The word cinema , short for cinematography , is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry , and to the art form that is the result of it . The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera , by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques , by means of CGI and computer animation , or by a combination of some or all of these techniques , and other visual effects . Traditionally , films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen . Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production , distribution , and exhibition , while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack ( a graphic recording of the spoken words , music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it , and is not projected ) . Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures . They reflect those cultures , and , in turn , affect them . Film is considered to be an important art form , a source of popular entertainment , and a powerful medium for educating - or indoctrinating - citizens . The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication . Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages . The individual images that make up a film are called frames . In the projection of traditional celluloid films , a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame , in turn , is moved into position to be projected , but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision , whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears .",

  "/wiki/Hindi_language": "Hindi ( Devanagari : \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 , IAST/ISO 15919 : Hind\u012b ) or Modern Standard Hindi ( Devanagari : \u092e\u093e\u0928\u0915 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 , IAST/ISO 15919 : M\u0101nak Hind\u012b ) , is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in India and across the Indian subcontinent . Modern Hindi is the standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language , which itself is based primarily on the Khariboli dialect of Delhi and other nearby areas of Northern India . Hindi , written in the Devanagari script , is one of the two official languages of the Government of India , along with the English language . It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India . Hindi is the lingua franca of the Hindi belt and to a lesser extent other parts of India ( usually in a simplified or pidginised variety such as Bazaar Hindustani or Haflong Hindi ) . Outside India , several other languages are recognised officially as Hindi but do not refer to the Standard Hindi language described here and instead descend from other dialects , such as Awadhi and Bhojpuri . Such languages include Fiji Hindi , which is official in Fiji , and Caribbean Hindustani , which is spoken in Trinidad and Tobago , Guyana , and Suriname . Apart from the script and formal vocabulary , spoken Hindi is mutually intelligible with standard Urdu , another recognised register of Hindustani as both share a common colloquial base . As a linguistic variety , Hindi is the fourth most-spoken first language in the world , after Mandarin , Spanish and English . Hindi alongside Urdu as Hindustani is the third most-spoken language in the world , after Mandarin and English .",
