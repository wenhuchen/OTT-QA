Their first official production Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success in 1984 , and after securing a second year of funding , Lalibert\u00e9 hired Guy Caron from the National Circus School to recreate it as a proper circus . Its theatrical , character-driven approach and the absence of performing animals helped define Cirque du Soleil as the contemporary circus ( nouveau cirque ) that it remains today . After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s , Nouvelle Exp\u00e9rience was created - with the direction of Franco Dragone - which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990 , but allowed it to create new shows . Cirque du Soleil expanded rapidly through the 1990s and 2000s , growing from one show to 19 shows in over 300 cities on every continent except Antarctica . The company employs 4,900 people from 50 countries and generates an annual revenue of approximately US $ 1 billion .
