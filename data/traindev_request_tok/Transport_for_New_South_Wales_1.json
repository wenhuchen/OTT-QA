  "/wiki/Rail_Clearways_Program": "The Rail Clearways Program was a program of public works on Sydney 's suburban railway network conceived in 2004 with the aim of easing congestion by reducing the amount of infrastructure shared by multiple services . The disparate projects at pinch points throughout the network were designed to increase capacity and improve reliability . All projects were delivered by the Transport Construction Authority until it was subsumed in November 2011 by Transport for New South Wales . Following the introduction of a new timetable in October 2013 that realised the benefit of many of the projects , the program was completed with the opening of the final upgrade in January 2014 .",
  "/wiki/Suburban_rail": "Commuter rail , or suburban rail , is a passenger rail transport service that primarily operates within a metropolitan area , connecting commuters to a central city from adjacent suburbs or commuter towns . Generally commuter rail systems are considered heavy rail , using electrified or diesel trains . Distance charges or zone pricing may be used . The term can refer to systems with a wide variety of different features and service frequencies , but is often used in contrast to rapid transit or light rail . Similar non-English terms include Treno suburbano in Italian , Cercan\u00edas in Spanish , Rodalies in Catalan , Proastiakos in Greek , Train de banlieue in French , P\u0159\u00edm\u011bstsk\u00fd vlak or Esko in Czech , Elektrichka in Russian , Poci\u0105g podmiejski in Polish and Pendelt\u00e5g in Swedish . Some services share similarities with both commuter rail and high-frequency rapid transit , such as the German S-Bahn , the R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional in Paris , many Japanese commuter systems , and some Australasian suburban networks . Some services , like British commuter rail , share tracks with other passenger services and freight . In the United States , commuter rail often refers to services that operate a higher frequency during peak periods and a lower frequency off-peak . Since the creation of GO Transit 's commuter service in 1967 , commuter rail services and route length have been expanding in North America . In the US , commuter rail is sometimes referred to as regional rail .",

The final stage was completed in June 2016 .",
  "/wiki/Freight_rail": "Rail freight transport is the use of railroads and trains to transport cargo as opposed to human passengers . A freight train , cargo train , or goods train is a group of freight cars ( US ) or goods wagons ( International Union of Railways ) hauled by one or more locomotives on a railway , transporting cargo all or some of the way between the shipper and the intended destination as part of the logistics chain . Trains may haul bulk material , intermodal containers , general freight or specialized freight in purpose-designed cars . Rail freight practices and economics vary by country and region . When considered in terms of ton-miles or tonne-kilometers hauled per unit of energy consumed , rail transport can be more efficient than other means of transportation . Maximum economies are typically realized with bulk commodities ( e.g. , coal ) , especially when hauled over long distances . However , shipment by rail is not as flexible as by the highway , which has resulted in much freight being hauled by truck , even over long distances . Moving goods by rail often involves transshipment costs , particularly when the shipper or receiver lack direct rail access . These costs may exceed that of operating the train itself , a factor that practices such as containerization aim to minimize .",

  "/wiki/Subway_(underpass)": "In the United Kingdom , the Republic of Ireland , Hong Kong and Commonwealth countries such as India , South Africa , Australia and New Zealand ( but not commonly in Canada ) , a subway is normally an underpass for pedestrians and/or cyclists beneath a road or railway , allowing them to reach the other side in safety . Subways may also be constructed for the benefit of wildlife . In the United States , as used by the California Department of Transportation and in parts of Pennsylvania such as Harrisburg , Duncannon and Wyoming County , it can mean a depressed road undercrossing . Subways are less common in North American cities than in European cities of comparable size . They are constructed when it is necessary for pedestrians to cross a railway line or a dual carriageway such as an interstate highway , and they appear at the exits from underground rapid transit systems , but one would be rarely built to enable people to cross an ordinary city street . When they are built , the term pedestrian underpass is more likely to be used , because subway in North America refers to rapid transit systems such as the New York City Subway or the Toronto Subway . This usage also occurs in Scotland , where the underground railway in Glasgow is referred to as the Glasgow Subway . In the Philippines , the term is also underpass , and there are two types : underpasses for pedestrians such as along Ayala Avenue in Makati and in the City of Manila near Quiapo Church , and vehicular ones along the length of EDSA and other thoroughfares . One of the earliest and most notable vehicular underpasses is the Lagusnilad in front of Manila City Hall .",

  "/wiki/Rapid_transit": "Rapid transit or mass rapid transit ( MRT ) , also known as heavy rail , metro , subway , tube , U-Bahn or underground , is a type of high-capacity public transport generally found in urban areas . Unlike buses or trams , rapid transit systems are electric railways that operate on an exclusive right-of-way , which can not be accessed by pedestrians or other vehicles of any sort , and which is often grade separated in tunnels or on elevated railways . Modern service on rapid transit systems are provided on designated lines between stations typically using electric multiple units on rail tracks , although some systems use guided rubber tires , magnetic levitation , or monorail . The stations typically have high platforms , without steps inside the trains , requiring custom-made trains in order to minimize gaps between train and platform . They are typically integrated with other public transport and often operated by the same public transport authorities . However , some rapid transit systems have at-grade intersections between a rapid transit line and a road or between two rapid transit lines . The world 's first rapid transit system was the partially underground Metropolitan Railway which opened as a conventional railway in 1863 , and now forms part of the London Underground . In 1868 , New York opened the elevated West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway , initially a cable-hauled line using static steam engines . China has the largest number of rapid transit systems in the world at 31 , with over 4,500 km of lines and is responsible for most of the world 's rapid transit expansion in the past decade . The world 's longest single-operator rapid transit system by route length is the Shanghai Metro . The world 's largest single rapid transit service provider by number of stations ( 472 stations in total ) is the New York City Subway . The busiest rapid transit systems in the world by annual ridership are the Tokyo subway system , the Seoul Metropolitan Subway , the Moscow Metro , the Beijing Subway , the Shanghai Metro , the Shenzhen Metro , the Guangzhou Metro , the New York City Subway , the Mexico City Metro , the Paris M\u00e9tro , the Hong Kong MTR and the Singapore MRT ."
