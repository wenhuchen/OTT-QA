During World War I , the Ottomans took control of the city in 1918 and declared the Provisional National Government of the Southwestern Caucasus ( promulgated 1 December 1918 ) , but ceded it to the First Republic of Armenia following the Armistice of Mudros ( signed 30 October 1918 ) . During the war in 1915 , Turkish revolutionaries captured Kars for the last time . The Treaty of Kars , signed in 1921 by the Government of the Grand National Assembly and by the Soviet republics of Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia , established the current north-eastern boundaries of Turkey .

In 1945 Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov rejected the treaty ."
