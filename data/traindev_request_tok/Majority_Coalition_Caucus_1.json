He is a member of the Washington State Senate representing Washington 's 4th Legislative District .

In the 1976 U.S. presidential election , Gerald Ford , the Republican candidate and incumbent , had lost the race to Democrat , and former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter . Rather than vote as pledged , for President Ford , Padden instead cast his vote for Ronald Reagan , who had lost the Republican nomination to Ford earlier that year . He entered the Washington House of Representatives in January 1981 and served there until 1995 when he was appointed to serve as a district court judge in the Spokane County District Court . On June 13 , 2006 , Padden announced he would not run for re-election as judge . In 2007 , evidence surfaced that Padden used his influence as a judge to help direct more than $ 7.5 million in fees and interest payments to a former employer . At Paddens request , the state Commission on Judicial Conduct has issued a statement confirming that it examined complaints about Paddens 1999 selection of a former client as the official collection agency for District Court but found nothing to support an ethics violation . The commission typically acknowledges complaints only if it imposes discipline or sanctions . The agency , however , refused to disclose how it arrived at its conclusion or what the initial examination entailed . Padden was elected to the Washington Senate in November 2011 .",
