The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories .

  "/wiki/I_Was_Only_Nineteen": "Only 19 , I Was Only 19 or A Walk in the Light Green is the most widely recognised song by Australian folk group Redgum . The song was released in March 1983 as a single , which hit number one on the national Kent Music Report Singles Chart for two weeks . It was also recorded for Redgum 's live album Caught in the Act ( Epic Records ) released in June , which stayed in the top 40 of the Kent Music Report Albums Chart for four months . Royalties for the song go to the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia . It is in the Australasian Performing Right Association 's Top 30 Australian Songs of all time . The song is a first-person account of a typical Australian soldier 's experience in the Vietnam War , from training in Australia to first hand exposure to military operations and combat , and ultimately his return home disillusioned , psychologically scarred and possibly suffering from the effects of the chemical defoliant Agent Orange . Contrary to popular belief , the subject of this song is a volunteer member of the Australian Army , and not a conscript . Australian men did not become eligible for conscription until the age of 21 . Redgum 's lead vocalist-guitarist , John Schumann , wrote the song based on experiences he heard from veterans , particularly Mick Storen ( his brother in-law ) and Frankie Hunt . Schumann has said that the power derives from the detail , provided by my mate and brother-in-law , Mick Storen , who was brave and trusting enough to share his story with me . For the live version , Schumann explained the title , A Walk in the Light Green , as referring to operational patrols in areas marked light green on topographical maps , where dark green indicated thick jungle , plenty of cover and few land mines and light green indicated thinly wooded areas , little cover and a high likelihood of land mines . In January 2018 , as part of Triple M 's Ozzest 100 , the 'most Australian ' songs of all time , I Was Only 19 was ranked number 20 .",
