Following Belushi 's death , and with Aykroyd 's concept deemed financially impractical , he was paired with Ramis to rewrite the script to set it in New York City and make it more realistic . Ghostbusters was the first comedy film to employ expensive special effects . There was concern about the budget it would require , and little faith in its potential for box office success .

Ghostbusters was released on June 8 , 1984 , to critical acclaim and became a cultural phenomenon .",
