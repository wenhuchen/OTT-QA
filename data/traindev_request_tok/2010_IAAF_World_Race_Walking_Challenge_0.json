  "/wiki/Hobart": "Hobart ( /\u02c8ho\u028ab\u0251\u02d0rt/ ( listen ) ) is the capital and most populous city of the Australian island state of Tasmania . With a population of approximately 240,342 ( over 45% of Tasmania 's population ) , it is the least populated Australian state capital city , and second smallest if territories are taken into account ( after Darwin , Northern Territory ) . The city is located in the state 's south-east on the estuary of the River Derwent , making it the most southern of Australia 's capital cities . Its skyline is dominated by the 1,271-metre ( 4,170 ft ) Mount Wellington , and its harbour forms the second-deepest natural port in the world , with much of the city 's waterfront consisting of reclaimed land . The metropolitan area is often referred to as Greater Hobart , to differentiate it from the City of Hobart , one of the five local government areas that cover the city . Founded in 1804 as a British penal colony , Hobart is Australia 's second oldest capital city after Sydney , New South Wales . Prior to British settlement , the Hobart area had been occupied for possibly as long as 35,000 years , by the semi-nomadic Mouheneener tribe , a sub-group of the Nuennone , or South-East tribe . The descendants of these Aboriginal Tasmanians often refer to themselves as 'Palawa ' . Since its foundation , the city has expanded from the mouth of Sullivans Cove in a generally north-south direction along both banks of the River Derwent , from 22 km inland from the estuary at Storm Bay to the point where the river reverts to fresh water at Bridgewater . Penal transportation ended in the 1850s , after which the city experienced periods of growth and decline . The early 20th century saw an economic boom on the back of mining , agriculture and other primary industries , and the loss of men who served in the world wars was counteracted by an influx of immigration . Despite the rise in migration from Asia and other non-English speaking regions , Hobart 's population remains predominantly ethnically Anglo-Celtic , and has the highest percentage of Australian-born residents among Australia 's capital cities .",
  "/wiki/Australia": "Australia , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the largest country in Oceania and the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The population of 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest city is Sydney . The country 's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth , and Adelaide . Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century , who named it New Holland . In 1770 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 , a date which became Australia 's national day . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the time of an 1850s gold rush , most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy , comprising six states and ten territories . Australia is the oldest , flattest , and driest inhabited continent , with the least fertile soils . It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres ( 2,941,300 sq mi ) .",

The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced [ litua ] ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions . Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . [ citation needed ] A likely candidate is Liet\u0101 . Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms , linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym \u2192 toponym \u2192 ethnonym . Lietava , a small river not far from Kernav\u0117 , the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation . On the other hand , such naming is not unprecedented in world history . Art\u016bras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis , that Lietuva relates to the word lei\u010diai ( plural of leitis ) .",

At the end of the Western Roman Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe , invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces , including the Suebi , Alans and Vandals .",

With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides , in addition to the old inner and outer city walls , Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital .",

Covering approximately 9,600,000 square kilometers ( 3,700,000 sq mi ) , it is the third largest country by area . [ j ] Governed by the Communist Party of China , the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , [ k ] five autonomous regions , four direct-controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Tianjin , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . China emerged as one of the world 's first civilizations , in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain . For millennia , China 's political system was based on hereditary monarchies , or dynasties , beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE . Since then , China has expanded , fractured , and re-unified numerous times . In the 3rd century BCE , the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire . The succeeding Han dynasty , which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE , saw some of the most advanced technology at that time , including papermaking and the compass , along with agricultural and medical improvements . The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) and Northern Song ( 960-1127 ) completed the Four Great Inventions . Tang culture spread widely in Asia , as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa . Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution , when the Republic of China ( ROC ) replaced the Qing dynasty . China , as a whole , was ravaged by feudal warlordism and Japan during World War II ."
