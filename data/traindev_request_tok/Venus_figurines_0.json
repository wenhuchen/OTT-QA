  "/wiki/Serpentine_group": "The serpentine subgroup ( part of the kaolinite-serpentine group ) are greenish , brownish , or spotted minerals commonly found in serpentinite rocks . They are used as a source of magnesium and asbestos , and as a decorative stone . The name is thought to come from the greenish color being that of a serpent . The serpentine group describes a group of common rock-forming hydrous magnesium iron phyllosilicate ( ( Mg , Fe ) 3Si2O5 ( OH ) 4 ) minerals , resulting from the metamorphism of the minerals that are contained in ultramafic rocks . They may contain minor amounts of other elements including chromium , manganese , cobalt or nickel . In mineralogy and gemology , serpentine may refer to any of 20 varieties belonging to the serpentine group . Owing to admixture , these varieties are not always easy to individualize , and distinctions are not usually made . There are three important mineral polymorphs of serpentine : antigorite , chrysotile and lizardite . The serpentine group of minerals are polymorphous , meaning that they have the same chemical formulae , but the atoms are arranged into different structures , or crystal lattices . Chrysotile , which has a fiberous habit , is one polymorph of serpentine and is one of the more important asbestos minerals . Other polymorphs in the serpentine group may have a platy habit . Antigorite and lizardite are the polymorphs with platy habit .",

Common examples are earthenware , porcelain , and brick . The crystallinity of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi-crystalline , vitrified , and often completely amorphous ( e.g. , glasses ) . Most often , fired ceramics are either vitrified or semi-vitrified as is the case with earthenware , stoneware , and porcelain . Varying crystallinity and electron composition in the ionic and covalent bonds cause most ceramic materials to be good thermal and electrical insulators ( extensively researched in ceramic engineering ) . With such a large range of possible options for the composition/structure of a ceramic ( e.g . nearly all of the elements , nearly all types of bonding , and all levels of crystallinity ) , the breadth of the subject is vast , and identifiable attributes ( e.g . hardness , toughness , electrical conductivity , etc . ) are difficult to specify for the group as a whole . General properties such as high melting temperature , high hardness , poor conductivity , high moduli of elasticity , chemical resistance and low ductility are the norm , with known exceptions to each of these rules ( e.g . piezoelectric ceramics , glass transition temperature , superconductive ceramics , etc. ) . Many composites , such as fiberglass and carbon fiber , while containing ceramic materials , are not considered to be part of the ceramic family .",

Italy is located in south-central Europe , and it is also considered a part of Western Europe . The country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 ( 116,350 sq mi ) and shares land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino . Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland ( Campione ) and a maritime exclave in the Tunisian Sea ( Lampedusa ) . With around 60 million inhabitants , Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union . The capital and largest city is Rome ; other major cities are Milan , Naples , Turin , Palermo , Genoa , Bologna , Florence and Venice . Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean , Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures . In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy , the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name , beginning from the classical era , Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy , Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy , while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively . An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC , which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People . The Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula , eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe , North Africa and Asia . By the first century BC , the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural , political and religious centre , inaugurating the Pax Romana , a period of more than 200 years during which Italy 's law , technology , economy , art , and literature developed . Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire , whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture , governments , Christianity and the Latin script .",

The largest is Heimbach-Weis , with approximately 8000 inhabitants . Founded by Count Frederick of Wied in 1653 as residence of the Lower County of Wied , Neuwied was located near the village of Langendorf , destroyed during the Thirty Years ' War ( 1618-1648 ) . It grew rapidly due to its religious tolerance . Among those who sought refuge here was a colony of Moravian Brethren . Near Neuwied , one of the largest Roman castra on the Rhine has been excavated by archeologists . In April 1797 the French , under General Louis Lazare Hoche , defeated the Austrians near Neuwied , this being their first decisive success in the French Revolutionary Wars . Neuwied is the native town of paternal ancestors of John D. Rockefeller , traced to the 16th century and possible French Huguenot refugees .

  "/wiki/Antler": "Antlers are extensions of an animal 's skull found in members of the deer family . Antlers are true bone and are a single structure . They are generally found only on males , with the exception of the reindeer/caribou . Antlers are shed and regrown each year and function primarily as objects of sexual attraction and as weapons in fights between males for control of harems . In contrast , horns , found on pronghorns and bovids such as sheep , goats , bison and cattle , are two-part structures . An interior of bone ( also an extension of the skull ) is covered by an exterior sheath made of keratin , the same material as human fingernails and toenails , grown by specialized hair follicles . Horns are never shed and continue to grow throughout the animal 's life . The exception to this rule is the pronghorn which sheds and regrows its horn sheath each year . They usually grow in symmetrical pairs .",
  "/wiki/Bone": "A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton in animals . Bones protect the various organs of the body , produce red and white blood cells , store minerals , provide structure and support for the body , and enable mobility . Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure . They are lightweight yet strong and hard , and serve multiple functions . Bone tissue ( osseous tissue ) is a hard tissue , a type of dense connective tissue . It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally , which helps to give the bone rigidity . Bone tissue is made up of different types of bone cells . Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralization of bone ; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue . Modified ( flattened ) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface . The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called ossein and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts . Bone tissue is a mineralized tissue of two types , cortical bone and cancellous bone . Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow , endosteum , periosteum , nerves , blood vessels and cartilage .",
