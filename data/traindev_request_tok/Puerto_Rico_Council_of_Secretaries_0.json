He was appointed in 2017 by Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 and fired for loss of Confidence by Wanda V\u00e1zquez in 2020 , current Governor of Puerto Rico . Gil-Ense\u00f1at was born in Mayaguez , Puerto Rico . Before being appointed Secretary , he served as the Associated Administrator for acquisition and contracting in the Public Housing Administration of Puerto Rico . Fernando Gil has a Bachelor 's degree in political science from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez , a Juris Doctor from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico and studies at master 's degree in private international law at Washington College of Law . In February 2019 , Gil-Ense\u00f1at was also answering questions as to why the Foundation for Puerto Rico received a large block of the grant money for rebuilding and reconstructing without going through a normal bidding process . As of September 2019 , two years after Hurricane Maria , Gil-Ense\u00f1at was negotiating the distribution of funds for island reconstruction and relief for homeowners who lost their homes or home 's roof . Release of funds has been mired in delays : first by a U.S. government shutdown , then by HUD wanting to audit the administration of funds after Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 's Telegate scandal and resignation . Recommendations for how to satisfy eligibility requirements for the CDBG-DR ( what the grant is called ) were recommended in a letter addressed to Gil-Ense\u00f1at , in March 2018 , by the National Low Income Housing Coalition . While hundreds of thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed - repairing or replacing the roofs is a monumental undertaking in any situation , but one that is particularly daunting in Puerto Rico , where many homes are built informally , without permits or titles . Qualifying for the Federal Emergency Management Agencys individual assistance program requires proof of homeownership , leaving many hurricane survivors ineligible because they have no deeds , leases , or mortgages . Gil-Ense\u00f1at was quoted as saying that until a recent meeting , treatment of Puerto Rico seemed unfair and discriminatory and that many of the requirements make accessing the relief funds extremely difficult .",
