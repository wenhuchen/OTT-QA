The anthropologist Alfred Kroeber gave him this name because in the Yahi culture , tradition demanded that he not speak his own name until formally introduced by another Yahi . When asked his name , he said : I have none , because there were no people to name me , meaning that there was no other Yahi to speak his name on his behalf . Ishi was taken in by anthropologists at the University of California , Berkeley , who both studied him and hired him as a janitor . He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in San Francisco . His life was depicted and discussed in multiple films and books , notably the biographical account Ishi in Two Worlds published by Theodora Kroeber in 1961 .",

Although he achieved little commercial success , he sustained a cult following as a highly significant and incalculable influence on an array of new wave , punk , and experimental rock artists . An artistic prodigy in his childhood , Van Vliet developed an eclectic musical taste during his teen years in Lancaster , California , and formed a mutually useful but volatile friendship with musician Frank Zappa , with whom he sporadically competed and collaborated . He began performing with his Captain Beefheart persona in 1964 and joined the original Magic Band line-up , initiated by Alexis Snouffer , the same year . The group released their debut album Safe as Milk in 1967 on Buddah Records . After being dropped by two consecutive record labels they signed to Zappa 's Straight Records , where they released 1969 's Trout Mask Replica ; the album would later rank 58th in Rolling Stone magazine 's 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . In 1974 , frustrated by lack of commercial success , he pursued a more conventional rock sound , but the ensuing albums were critically panned ; this move , combined with not having been paid for a European tour , and years of enduring Beefheart 's abusive behavior , led the entire band to quit . Beefheart eventually formed a new Magic Band with a group of younger musicians and regained critical approval through three final albums : Shiny Beast ( 1978 ) , Doc at the Radar Station ( 1980 ) and Ice Cream for Crow ( 1982 ) . Van Vliet made few public appearances after his retirement from music in 1982 .",
