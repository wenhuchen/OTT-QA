  "/wiki/Section_(United_States_land_surveying)": "In U.S. land surveying under the Public Land Survey System ( PLSS ) , a section is an area nominally one square mile ( 2.6 square kilometers ) , containing 640 acres ( 260 hectares ) , with 36 sections making up one survey township on a rectangular grid . The legal description of a tract of land under the PLSS includes the name of the state , name of the county , township number , range number , section number , and portion of a section . Sections are customarily surveyed into smaller squares by repeated halving and quartering . A quarter section is 160 acres ( 65 ha ) and a quarter-quarter section is 40 acres ( 16 ha ) . In 1832 the smallest area of land that could be acquired was reduced to the 40-acre ( 16 ha ) quarter-quarter section , and this size parcel became entrenched in American mythology . After the Civil War , freedmen ( freed slaves ) were reckoned to be self-sufficient with 40 acres and a mule . In the 20th century real estate developers preferred working with 40-acre ( 16 ha ) parcels . The phrases front 40 and back 40 , referring to farm fields , indicate the front and back quarter-quarter sections of land . One of the reasons for creating sections of 640 acres ( 260 ha ) was the ease of dividing into halves and quarters while still maintaining a whole number of acres . A section can be halved seven times in this way , down to a 5-acre ( 2 ha ) parcel , or half of a quarter-quarter-quarter section - an easily surveyed 50-square-chain ( 2 ha ) area . This system was of great practical value on the American frontier , where surveyors often had a shaky grasp of mathematics and were required to work quickly . A description of a quarter-quarter section in standard abbreviated form , might look like NW 1/4 , NE 1/4 , Sec .",
