  "/wiki/Pride_&_Prejudice_(2005_film)": "Pride & Prejudice is a 2005 romance film directed by Joe Wright and based on Jane Austen 's 1813 novel of the same name . The film depicts five sisters from an English family of landed gentry as they deal with issues of marriage , morality and misconceptions . Keira Knightley stars in the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet , while Matthew Macfadyen plays her romantic interest Mr. Darcy . Produced by Working Title Films in association with StudioCanal , the film was released on 16 September 2005 in the United Kingdom and Ireland and on 11 November in the United States . Screenwriter Deborah Moggach initially attempted to make her script as faithful to the novel as possible , writing from Elizabeth 's perspective while preserving much of the original dialogue . Wright , who was directing his first feature film , encouraged greater deviation from the text , including changing the dynamics within the Bennet family . Wright and Moggach set the film in an earlier period and avoided depicting a perfectly clean Regency world , presenting instead a muddy hem version of the time . It was shot entirely on location in England on a 15-week schedule . Wright found casting difficult due to past performances of particular characters . The filmmakers had to balance who they thought was best for each role with the studio 's desire for stars . Knightley was well-known in part from her work in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series , while Macfadyen had no international name recognition . The film 's themes emphasise realism , romanticism and family .",
  "/wiki/George_Wickham": "George Wickham is a fictional character created by Jane Austen who appears in her novel Pride and Prejudice , published in 1813 . George Wickham is introduced as a militia officer who has a shared history with Mr. Darcy . Wickham 's charming demeanour and his story of being badly treated by Darcy attracts the sympathy of the heroine , Elizabeth Bennet , to the point that she is warned by her aunt not to fall in love and marry him . It is revealed through the course of the story that George Wickham 's true nature is that of a manipulative unprincipled layabout , a ne'er-do-well wastrel , compulsive liar ( talking out of both sides of mouth , and using the truth to make his falsehoods very believable ) and a degenerate , compulsive gambler , a seducer and a libertine , living the lifestyle of a rake . Lacking the finances to pay for his lifestyle , he gambles regularly ( not just because he is a degenerate compulsive gambler and has no sense of economy ) and cons credit from tradesmen and shopkeepers and skips out on paying-up . Jane Austen 's inspiration for the plot developed around the character of George Wickham was Tom Jones , a novel by Henry Fielding , where two boys - one rich , one poor - grow up together and have a confrontational relationship when they are adults . A minor character , barely sketched out by the narrator to encourage the reader to share Elizabeth 's first impression of him , he nonetheless plays a crucial role in the unfolding of the plot , as the actantial scheme opponent , and as a foil to Darcy .",

Born in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld to a family connected to many of Europe 's ruling monarchs , at the age of twenty Albert married his cousin , Victoria ; they had nine children . Initially he felt constrained by his role of prince consort , which did not afford him power or responsibilities . He gradually developed a reputation for supporting public causes , such as educational reform and the abolition of slavery worldwide , and was entrusted with running the Queen 's household , office and estates . He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851 , which was a resounding success . Victoria came to depend more and more on Albert 's support and guidance . He aided the development of Britain 's constitutional monarchy by persuading his wife to be less partisan in her dealings with Parliament - although he actively disagreed with the interventionist foreign policy pursued during Lord Palmerston 's tenure as Foreign Secretary . Albert died following a long illness at the relatively young age of 42 . Victoria was so devastated at the loss of her husband that she entered into a deep state of mourning and wore black for the rest of her life . On her death in 1901 , their eldest son succeeded as Edward VII , the first British monarch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , named after the ducal house to which Albert belonged .",
