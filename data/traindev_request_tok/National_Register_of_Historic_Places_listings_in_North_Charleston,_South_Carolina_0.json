The much wider Ashley joins the Cooper River off the Battery in Charleston to form Charleston Harbor before discharging into the Atlantic Ocean . As of 2012 [ update ] the land around the Ashley River ( or in Ashley Barony , as the original land grant was called ) is mostly undeveloped . The river was named for Anthony Ashley Cooper , 1st Earl of Shaftesbury and chief Lord Proprietor of the Carolina Colony by explorer Robert Sandford . In 1675 Cooper was granted 12,000 acres of land along the river after a permanent settlement was made at Albemarle Point in 1670 . This settlement was the first permanent European settlement in South Carolina and today Albemarle Point is known as Charles Towne Landing .
