Rome 's history spans 28 centuries . While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC , the site has been inhabited for much longer , making it one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe . The city 's early population originated from a mix of Latins , Etruscans , and Sabines . Eventually , the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom , the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire , and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial City and metropolis .

It is administratively a Unitary authority , and thus not part of any district , county , or regional municipality . The Sudbury region was inhabited by the Ojibwe people of the Algonquin group for thousands of years prior to the founding of Sudbury following the discovery of nickel ore in 1883 during the construction of the transcontinental railway . Greater Sudbury was formed in 2001 by merging the cities and towns of the former Regional Municipality of Sudbury with several previously unincorporated townships . Being located inland , the local climate is extremely seasonal with average January lows of around \u221218 \u00b0C ( 0 \u00b0F ) and average July highs of 25 \u00b0C ( 77 \u00b0F ) . The population resides in an urban core and many smaller communities scattered around 330 lakes and among hills of rock blackened by historical smelting activity . Sudbury was once a major lumber centre and a world leader in nickel mining . Mining and related industries dominated the economy for much of the 20th century . The two major mining companies which shaped the history of Sudbury were Inco , now Vale Limited , which employed more than 25% of the population by the 1970s , and Falconbridge , now Glencore . Sudbury has since expanded from its resource-based economy to emerge as the major retail , economic , health and educational centre for Northeastern Ontario .",

The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin . Leipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire . The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii , two important medieval trade routes . Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing . After the Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East German terms , but its cultural and economic importance declined . Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe , mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church . The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy , which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry , severe unemployment , and urban blight .",
