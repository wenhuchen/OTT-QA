It is composed of nine federated states ( Bundesl\u00e4nder ) , one of which is Vienna , Austria 's capital and its largest city . It is bordered by Germany to the northwest , Czech Republic to the north , Slovakia to the northeast , Hungary to the east , Slovenia and Italy to the south , and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west . Austria occupies an area of 83,879 km2 ( 32,386 sq mi ) and has a population of nearly 9 million people . While German is the country 's official language , many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian dialects . Austria initially emerged as a margraviate around 976 and developed into a duchy and archduchy . In the 16th century , Austria started serving as the heart of the Habsburg Monarchy and the junior branch of the House of Habsburg - one of the most influential royal dynasties in history . As an archduchy , it was a major component and administrative centre of the Holy Roman Empire . Early in the 19th century , Austria established its own empire , which became a great power and the leading force of the German Confederation but pursued its own course independently of the other German states . Following the Austro-Prussian War and the compromise with Hungary , the Dual Monarchy was established . Austria was involved in World War I under Emperor Franz Joseph following the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand , the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne . After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy , the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed with the intent of the union with Germany , which eventually failed because of the Allied Powers and the state remained unrecognized .",

He acquired his Matura in 2004 at the GRG 12 Erlgasse and subsequently completed mandatory military service in 2005 . Following the same year , Kurz attended the faculty of law ( Juridicum ) at the University of Vienna , but voluntarily left before graduating to focus on his political career . Kurz entered politics when he joined the Young People 's Party ( JVP ) in 2003 . Five years later he assumed his first political office there as chairman of the JVP for Vienna . In 2010 , Kurz successfully ran for the Viennese State Diet and thereby obtained his first governmental post . Following a reshuffle of the First Faymann cabinet in 2011 , Kurz was nominated and appointed state secretary of the Interior Ministry for social integration . After the 2013 legislative election , Kurz became foreign minister of Austria and retained this position until 2017 . Following the resignation of Vice Chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner as chairman of the People 's Party ( \u00d6VP ) in May 2017 , Kurz was named his successor . Mitterlehner 's withdrawal from politics led to the end of the Kern cabinet and triggered a legislative snap election in 2017 ; in which Kurz participated as the top candidate of his party , gaining tremendous popularity with his core topics of immigration and social politics .",

It is bordered by Romania to the north , Serbia and North Macedonia to the west , Greece and Turkey to the south , and the Black Sea to the east . The capital and largest city is Sofia ; other major cities are Plovdiv , Varna and Burgas . With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres ( 42,855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th-largest country . One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture , which dates back to 6,500 BC . In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians , Persians , Celts and ancient Macedonians ; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45 . The Eastern Roman , or Byzantine , Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century . The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681 , which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script . This state lasted until the early 11th century , when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it . A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire , which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II ( 1218-1241 ) . After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife , the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State .",

The earliest known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC . Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia , and Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world .

Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic Egypt , the Classical and Eastern Roman Empire , Arab caliphates for a short period , the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians , was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman rule between 1571 and 1878 ( de jure until 1914 ) . Cyprus was placed under the UK 's administration based on the Cyprus Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914 . While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population , the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s . Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an extension of Anatolia by them ; while , since the 19th century , the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece , which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s .

By the 12th century , Hungary became a regional power , reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century . Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire ( 1541-1699 ) .

The country 's de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II , beginning with Latvia 's forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union , followed by the invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and the re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944 ( Courland Pocket in 1945 ) to form the Latvian SSR for the next 45 years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the Communist regime 's illegal takeover .

In February 2013 , Iohannis became a member of the National Liberal Party , accepting an invitation from then liberal leader Crin Antonescu , and was immediately elected the party 's First Vice President , eventually becoming the PNL President during the following year . In October 2009 , four of the five political groups in the Parliament , excluding the Democratic Liberal Party of then-President Traian B\u0103sescu , proposed him as a candidate for the office of Prime Minister of Romania ; however , B\u0103sescu refused to nominate him despite the Parliament 's adoption of a declaration supporting his candidacy . He was again the candidate for Prime Minister of the National Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party in the elections in the same year . Iohannis is the first Romanian president to come from an ethnic minority . He is a Transylvanian Saxon , part of Romania 's German minority which settled in Transylvania in the 12th century . He was re-elected in the 2019 Romanian presidential election .",

  "/wiki/National_Liberal_Party_(Romania)": "The National Liberal Party ( Romanian : Partidul Na\u021bional Liberal , PNL ) is a political liberal and conservative-liberal party in Romania . Refounded in 1990 , it claims the legacy of the major political party of the same name , active between 1875 and the late 1940s in the Kingdom of Romania . Based on this legacy , it often presents itself as the first formally constituted political party in the country and the oldest party from the family of European liberal parties . Until 2014 , the PNL was a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe ( ALDE ) . The party statutes adopted in June 2014 dropped any reference to international affiliation , consequently most of its MEPs joined the European People 's Party group ( EPP ) in the European Parliament . On 12 September 2014 , it was admitted as a full member of the European People 's Party , and subsequently merged with the Democratic Liberal Party . The party was also a member of the Liberal International before switching to Centrist Democrat International . Currently , it is the second-largest party in the Romanian Parliament , with 78 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 28 in the Senate , behind the opposition Social Democratic Party ( PSD ) .",

In the 10th century , after the dissolution of Great Moravia , the territory was integrated into the Principality of Hungary , which would become the Kingdom of Hungary in 1000 . In 1241 and 1242 , much of the territory was destroyed by the Mongols during their invasion of Central and Eastern Europe . The area was recovered largely thanks to B\u00e9la IV of Hungary who also settled Germans who became an important ethnic group in the area , especially in what are today parts of central and eastern Slovakia . After World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , the Czechoslovak National Council established Czechoslovakia ( 1918-1939 ) .",

There have been nine officeholders since the country gained parliamentary democracy in 1989 and independence in 1991 . The Prime Minister of Slovenia is nominated by the President of the Republic after consultation with the parties represented in the National Assembly . He is then formally elected by a simple majority of the National Assembly . If no candidate receives a majority , a new vote must be held within 14 days . If no candidate receives a majority after this round , the President must dissolve the legislature and call new parliamentary elections unless the National Assembly agrees to hold a third round . If no candidate is elected after a third round , then the legislature is automatically dissolved pending new elections . In practice , since the appointee must command a majority of the National Assembly in order to govern , he or she is usually the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition . The National Assembly can only withdraw its support from a Prime Minister by way of a constructive vote of no confidence-that is , a motion of no confidence is of no effect unless a prospective successor has the support of a majority .
