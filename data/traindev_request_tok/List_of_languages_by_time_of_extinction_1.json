  "/wiki/Pama-Nyungan_languages": "The Pama-Nyungan languages are the most widespread family of Australian Aboriginal languages , containing perhaps 300 languages . The name Pama-Nyungan is derived from the names of the two most widely separated groups , the Pama languages of the northeast and the Nyungan languages of the southwest . The words pama and nyunga mean man in their respective languages . The other language families indigenous to the continent of Australia are occasionally referred to , by exclusion , as non-Pama-Nyungan languages , though this is not a taxonomic term . The Pama-Nyungan family accounts for most of the geographic spread , most of the Aboriginal population , and the greatest number of languages . Most of the Pama-Nyungan languages are spoken by small ethnic groups of hundreds of speakers or fewer . The vast majority of languages , either due to disease or elimination of their speakers , have become extinct , and almost all remaining ones are endangered in some way . Only in the central inland portions of the continent do Pama-Nyungan languages remain spoken vigorously by the entire community . The Pama-Nyungan family was identified and named by Kenneth L. Hale , in his work on the classification of Native Australian languages . Hale 's research led him to the conclusion that of the Aboriginal Australian languages , one relatively closely interrelated family had spread and proliferated over most of the continent , while approximately a dozen other families were concentrated along the North coast .",
  "/wiki/Queensland": "Queensland ( locally /\u02c8kwi\u02d0nzl\u00e6nd/ KWEENZ-land , [ note 1 ] abbreviated as Qld ) is the second-largest and third-most populous state in the Commonwealth of Australia . Situated in the north-east of the country , it is bordered by the Northern Territory , South Australia and New South Wales to the west , south-west and south respectively . To the east , Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean . To its north is the Torres Strait , with Papua New Guinea located less than 200 km across it from the mainland . The state is the world 's sixth-largest sub-national entity , with an area of 1,852,642 square kilometres ( 715,309 sq mi ) . As of 15 May 2018 , Queensland had a population of 5,000,000 , concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state 's South East . The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane , Australia 's third-largest city . Often referred to as the Sunshine State , Queensland is home to 10 of Australia 's 30 largest cities and is the nation 's third-largest economy . Tourism in the state , fuelled largely by its warm climate , is a major industry . Queensland was first inhabited by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders . The first European to land in Queensland ( and Australia ) was Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606 , who explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula near present-day Weipa . In 1770 , Lieutenant James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain .",

  "/wiki/Victoria,_Australia": "Victoria ( abbreviated as Vic ) is a state in south-eastern Australia . Victoria is Australia 's smallest mainland state and its second-most populous state ( after New South Wales ) , making it the most densely populated state . Most of its population lives concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay , which includes the metropolitan area of its state capital and largest city , Melbourne , Australia 's second-largest city . Victoria is bordered by Bass Strait and Tasmania to the south , [ note 1 ] New South Wales to the north , the Tasman Sea ( a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean ) to the east , and South Australia to the west . The area that is now known as Victoria is the home of many Aboriginal people groups , including the Boon wurrung , the Bratauolung , the Djadjawurrung , the Gunai/Kurnai , the Gunditjmara , the Taungurong , the Wathaurong , the Wurundjeri , and the Yorta Yorta . There were more than 30 Aboriginal languages spoken in the area prior to the European settlement of Australia . The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations which makes up much of the central part of the state . With Great Britain having claimed the half of the Australian continent that is east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria formed part of the wider colony of New South Wales . The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the Port Phillip District , an administrative division of New South Wales . Named in honour of Queen Victoria , who signed the division 's separation from New South Wales , the colony was officially established in 1851 and achieved self government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne served as federal capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .",

  "/wiki/Celtic_languages": "The Celtic languages ( usually /\u02c8k\u025blt\u026ak/ , but sometimes /\u02c8s\u025blt\u026ak/ ) are a group of related languages descended from Proto-Celtic . They form a branch of the Indo-European language family . The term Celtic was first used to describe this language group by Edward Lhuyd in 1707 , following Paul-Yves Pezron , who made the explicit link between the Celts described by classical writers and the Welsh and Breton languages . During the 1st millennium BC , Celtic languages were spoken across much of Europe and in Asia Minor . Today , they are restricted to the northwestern fringe of Europe and a few diaspora communities . There are four living languages : Welsh , Breton , Irish and Scottish Gaelic . All are minority languages in their respective countries , though there are continuing efforts at revitalisation . Welsh is an official language in Wales and Irish is an official language of Ireland and of the European Union . Welsh is the only Celtic language not classified as endangered by UNESCO . The Cornish and Manx languages went extinct in modern times . They have been the object of revivals and now each has several hundred second-language speakers . Irish , Scottish and Manx form the Goidelic languages , while Welsh , Cornish and Breton are Brittonic .",

It has 29 percent of the province 's land area . The island is separated from the Labrador Peninsula by the Strait of Belle Isle and from Cape Breton Island by the Cabot Strait . It blocks the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River , creating the Gulf of Saint Lawrence , the world 's largest estuary . Newfoundland 's nearest neighbour is the French overseas community of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon . With an area of 108,860 square kilometres ( 42,031 sq mi ) , Newfoundland is the world 's 16th-largest island , Canada 's fourth-largest island , and the largest Canadian island outside the North . The provincial capital , St. John 's , is located on the southeastern coast of the island ; Cape Spear , just south of the capital , is the easternmost point of North America , excluding Greenland . It is common to consider all directly neighbouring islands such as New World , Twillingate , Fogo and Bell Island to be 'part of Newfoundland ' ( i.e. , distinct from Labrador ) . By that classification , Newfoundland and its associated small islands have a total area of 111,390 square kilometres ( 43,008 sq mi ) . According to 2006 official Census Canada statistics , 57% of responding Newfoundland and Labradorians claim British or Irish ancestry , with 43.2% claiming at least one English parent , 21.5% at least one Irish parent , and 7% at least one parent of Scottish origin . Additionally 6.1% claimed at least one parent of French ancestry . The island 's total population as of the 2006 census was 479,105 .",

  "/wiki/Semitic_languages": "The Semitic languages , previously also named Syro-Arabian languages , are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family originating in the Middle East that are spoken by more than 330 million people across much of Western Asia , North Africa and the Horn of Africa , as well as in often large immigrant and expatriate communities in North America , Europe and Australasia . The terminology was first used in the 1780s by members of the G\u00f6ttingen School of History , who derived the name from Shem , one of the three sons of Noah in the Book of Genesis . The most widely spoken Semitic languages today are ( numbers given are for native speakers only ) Arabic ( 300 million ) , Amharic ( ~65 million ) , Tigrinya ( 7 million ) , Hebrew ( ~5 million native/L1 speakers ) , Tigre ( ~1.05 million ) , Aramaic ( 575,000 to 1 million largely Assyrian fluent speakers ) and Maltese ( 483,000 speakers ) . Semitic languages occur in written form from a very early historical date , with East Semitic Akkadian and Eblaite texts ( written in a script adapted from Sumerian cuneiform ) appearing from the 30th century BCE and the 25th century BCE in Mesopotamia and the northern Levant respectively . The only earlier attested languages are Sumerian , Elamite ( 2800 BCE to 550 BCE ) ( both language isolates ) , Egyptian and unclassified Lullubi from the 30th century BCE . Most scripts used to write Semitic languages are abjads - a type of alphabetic script that omits some or all of the vowels , which is feasible for these languages because the consonants in the Semitic languages are the primary carriers of meaning . Among them are the Ugaritic , Phoenician , Aramaic , Hebrew , Syriac , Arabic , and South Arabian alphabets . The Ge'ez script , used for writing the Semitic languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea , is technically an abugida - a modified abjad in which vowels are notated using diacritic marks added to the consonants at all times , in contrast with other Semitic languages which indicate diacritics based on need or for introductory purposes . Maltese is the only Semitic language written in the Latin script and the only Semitic language to be an official language of the European Union . The Semitic languages are notable for their nonconcatenative morphology . That is , word roots are not themselves syllables or words , but instead are isolated sets of consonants ( usually three , making a so-called triliteral root ) . Words are composed out of roots not so much by adding prefixes or suffixes , but rather by filling in the vowels between the root consonants ( although prefixes and suffixes are often added as well ) .",

It shares borders with Eritrea to the north , Djibouti to the northeast , Somalia , and the de facto state of Somaliland to the east , Kenya to the south , South Sudan to the west and Sudan to the northwest . With over 109 million inhabitants , Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world and the second-most populous nation on the African continent with a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres ( 420,000 sq mi ) . Its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa , which lies a few miles west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the Nubian and Somali tectonic plates . Some of the oldest skeletal evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia . It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era . Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BCE , Ethiopia 's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history . Oral literature tells that the monarchy was founded by the Solomonic dynasty of the Queen of Sheba , under its first king , Menelik I . In the first centuries , the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region , followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137 . During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa , Ethiopia and Liberia were two nations that preserved their sovereignty from long-term colonisation by a European colonial power and many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours . However , the country was later occupied by Italy in 1936 and became Italian Ethiopia ( part of Italian East Africa ) until it was liberated during World War II .",
  "/wiki/Sowa_language": "Sowa was the original language of south-central Pentecost island in Vanuatu . In recent times it has been totally displaced by Apma , a neighbouring language . Sowa was closely related to Ske , another south Pentecost language . Sowa was originally spoken on both western and eastern sides of Pentecost . Melsisi River formed the language 's north-western boundary , and its range extended southwards to a creek near the village of Levizendam . Following the depopulation of Pentecost that occurred after the introduction of European diseases , men from Sowa-speaking areas were forced to marry women from other parts of Pentecost , who were mostly Apma speakers . As a result , by the 1960s , Apma had totally replaced Sowa as the predominant local language . The last native Sowa speaker , Maurice Tabi of Vanvat village , died in 2000 . Today , a few local people whose fathers or mothers were Sowa speakers still remember parts of the language , although none speak it fluently . A couple , including Isaiah Tabi Vahka of Waterfall Village and Adam Bulesisbwat of Lesuubelakan , compiled short written notes on Sowa in an attempt to ensure that the language was not lost . The only linguist to have studied Sowa while the language was still alive was David Walsh , who collected a vocabulary list in 1969 , although Walsh 's main informant ( John Bule Seesee of Bwaravet village ) was not a native Sowa speaker . Andrew Gray , a British schoolteacher at Ranwadi College , worked with speakers ' children in the late 2000s to try to reconstruct the basics of the language .",

Part of the language family shows a strong influence of Sanskrit and Arabic as the western part of the region has been a stronghold of Hinduism , Buddhism and , later , Islam . Two morphological characteristics of the Malayo-Polynesian languages are a system of affixation and the reduplication ( repetition of all or part of a word , such as wiki-wiki ) to form new words . Like other Austronesian languages they have small phonemic inventories ; thus a text has few but frequent sounds . The majority also lack consonant clusters ( e.g. , [ str ] in English ) .

Vanuatu was first inhabited by Melanesian people . The first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s , who arrived on the largest island , Esp\u00edritu Santo , in 1606 . Since the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of Spain in 1580 ( following the vacancy of the Portuguese throne , which lasted for sixty years , until 1640 , when the Portuguese monarchy was restored ) , Queir\u00f3s claimed the archipelago for Spain , as part of the colonial Spanish East Indies , and named it La Austrialia del Esp\u00edritu Santo . In the 1880s , France and the United Kingdom claimed parts of the archipelago , and in 1906 , they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through an Anglo-French condominium .

  "/wiki/Unclassified_languages": "An unclassified language is a language whose genetic affiliation to other languages has not been established . Languages can be unclassified for a variety of reasons , mostly due to a lack of reliable data but sometimes due to the confounding influence of language contact , if different layers of its vocabulary or morphology point in different directions and it is not clear which represents the ancestral form of the language . Some poorly known extinct languages , such as Gutian and Cac\u00e1n , are simply unclassifiable , and it is unlikely the situation will ever change . A supposedly unclassified language may turn out not to be a language at all , or even a distinct dialect , but merely a family , tribal or village name , or an alternative name for a people or language that is classified . If a language 's genetic relationship has not been established after significant documentation of the language and comparison with other languages and families , as in the case of Basque in Europe , it is considered a language isolate - that is , it is classified as a language family of its own . An 'unclassified ' language therefore is one which may still turn out to belong to an established family once better data is available or more thorough comparative research is done . Extinct unclassified languages for which little evidence has been preserved are likely to remain in limbo indefinitely , unless lost documents or a surviving speaking population are discovered .",

At 1.28 million km2 ( 0.5 million mi2 ) , Peru is the 19th largest country in the world , and the third largest in South America . Peruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures . Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BC , the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization , to the Inca Empire , the largest state in pre-Columbian America , the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE . The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American colonies , with its capital in Lima . Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . Throughout the 20th century , Peru endured armed territorial disputes , coups , social unrest , and internal conflicts , as well as periods of stability and economic upswing . Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990 ; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency , though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent .
