These oil sands , hosted primarily in the McMurray Formation , consist of a mixture of crude bitumen ( a semi-solid rock-like form of crude oil ) , silica sand , clay minerals , and water . The Athabasca deposit is the largest known reservoir of crude bitumen in the world and the largest of three major oil sands deposits in Alberta , along with the nearby Peace River and Cold Lake deposits ( the latter stretching into Saskatchewan ) . The oil sands have long been referred to as tar sands ; [ by whom ? ] however , conservative groups [ who ? ] dispute this name due to its negative environmental associations . [ failed verification ] [ better source needed ] Together , these oil sand deposits lie under 141,000 square kilometres ( 54,000 sq mi ) of boreal forest and muskeg ( peat bogs ) and contain about 1.7 trillion barrels ( 270\u00d710^9 m3 ) of bitumen in-place , comparable in magnitude to the world 's total proven reserves of conventional petroleum . The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) lists the economically recoverable reserves , at 2007 prices and modern unconventional oil production technology , to be 178 billion barrels ( 28.3\u00d710^9 m3 ) , or about 10% of these deposits . These contribute to Canada 's total proven reserves being the third largest in the world , after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela 's Orinoco Belt . By 2009 , the two extraction methods used were in situ extraction , when the bitumen occurs deeper within the ground , ( which will account for 80 percent of oil sands development ) and surface or open-pit mining , when the bitumen is closer to the surface . Only 20 percent of bitumen can be extracted using open pit mining methods , which involves large scale excavation of the land with huge hydraulic power shovels and 400-ton heavy hauler trucks . Surface mining leaves toxic tailings ponds .",
