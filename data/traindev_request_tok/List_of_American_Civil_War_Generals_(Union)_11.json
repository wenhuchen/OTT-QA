Before becoming a territory , various indigenous peoples and Native Americans inhabited Indiana for thousands of years . Since its founding as a territory , settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the Eastern United States ; the state 's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from New England and New York , Central Indiana by migrants from the Mid-Atlantic states and from adjacent Ohio , and Southern Indiana by settlers from the Southern states , particularly Kentucky and Tennessee . Indiana has a diverse economy with a gross state product of $ 359.12 billion in 2017 . Indiana has several metropolitan areas with populations greater than 100,000 and a number of smaller industrial cities and towns . Indiana is home to professional sports teams , including the NFL 's Indianapolis Colts and the NBA 's Indiana Pacers , and hosts several notable athletic events , including the Indianapolis 500 .",

Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita , with its most populated county and largest employment center being Johnson County . Kansas is bordered by Nebraska on the north ; Missouri on the east ; Oklahoma on the south ; and Colorado on the west . Kansas is named after the Kansas River , which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks . The tribe 's name ( natively kk\u0105 : ze ) is often said to mean people of the ( south ) wind although this was probably not the term 's original meaning . For thousands of years , what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes . Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys . Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth . The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act , abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state . Thus , the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as Bleeding Kansas .",

Taylor previously was a career officer in the United States Army , rose to the rank of major general and became a national hero as a result of his victories in the Mexican-American War . As a result , he won election to the White House despite his vague political beliefs . His top priority as president was preserving the Union , but he died sixteen months into his term , before making any progress on the status of slavery , which had been inflaming tensions in Congress . Taylor was born into a prominent family of plantation owners who moved westward from Virginia to Louisville , Kentucky in his youth . He was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army in 1808 and made a name for himself as a captain in the War of 1812 . He climbed the ranks establishing military forts along the Mississippi River and entered the Black Hawk War as a colonel in 1832 . His success in the Second Seminole War attracted national attention and earned him the nickname Old Rough and Ready . In 1845 , during the annexation of Texas , President James K. Polk dispatched Taylor to the Rio Grande in anticipation of a battle with Mexico over the disputed Texas-Mexico border . The Mexican-American War broke out in April 1846 , and Taylor defeated Mexican troops commanded by General Mariano Arista at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma and drove his troops out of Texas . Taylor then led his troops into Mexico , where they defeated Mexican troops commanded by Pedro de Ampudia at the Battle of Monterrey .

The Port of Chicago connects the state to international ports via two main routes : from the Great Lakes , via the Saint Lawrence Seaway , to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River , via the Illinois Waterway to the Illinois River . The Mississippi River , the Ohio River , and the Wabash River form parts of the boundaries of Illinois . For decades , Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world 's busiest airports . Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and , through the 1980s , in politics . The capital of Illinois is Springfield , which is located in the central part of the state .

Following the American Revolutionary War , American settlers began arriving from Kentucky in the 1780s via the Ohio River , and the population grew from south to north .",

As Bragg marched north on September 18 , his cavalry and infantry fought with Union cavalry and mounted infantry , which were armed with Spencer repeating rifles . Fighting began in earnest on the morning of September 19 . Bragg 's men strongly assaulted but could not break the Union line . The next day , Bragg resumed his assault ."
