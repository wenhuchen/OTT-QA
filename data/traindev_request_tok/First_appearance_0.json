Hawkman is most often depicted as human archaeologist Carter Hall - the modern-day reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian prince named Khufu - or as alien police officer Katar Hol from the planet Thanagar . The character is generally regarded as having one of the most confusing backstories of any in DC Comics , due to a series of reinventions over the years following DCs 1985 series Crisis on Infinite Earths . Some writers have attempted to integrate Carter Hall and Katar Hol into one story by linking the Thanagarian aliens to the Egyptian curse that causes Hawkman to reincarnate periodically throughout human history , or by using Carter Hall as Katar Hol 's alias , or otherwise depicting the merger of Carter and Katar into one being . The character has been adapted into other media numerous times , with significant appearances in the animated Justice League Unlimited cartoon , which featured Hawkgirl as a main character , as well as several DC Universe Original Animated Movies .

Though much less frequently used in modern stories , he also deploys a range of trick arrows ( in contemporary times , they are referred as specialty arrows ) with various special functions , such as glue , explosive-tipped , grappling hook , flash grenade , tear gas and even kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations . At the time of his debut , Green Arrow functioned in many ways as an archery-themed analogue of the very popular Batman character , but writers at DC subsequently developed him into a voice of left-wing politics very much distinct in character from Batman . Green Arrow enjoyed moderate success in his early years , becoming the cover feature of More Fun , as well as having occasional appearances in other comics . Throughout his first twenty-five years , however , the character never enjoyed greater popularity . In the late 1960s , writer Denny O'Neil , inspired by the character 's dramatic visual redesign by Neal Adams , chose to have him lose his fortune , giving him the then-unique role of a streetwise crusader for the working class and the disadvantaged . In 1970 , he was paired with a more law and order-oriented hero , Green Lantern , in a ground-breaking , socially conscious comic book series . Since then , he has been popular among comic book fans and most writers have taken an urban , gritty approach to the character .",
  "/wiki/Wonder_Woman": "Wonder Woman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics . The character is a founding member of the Justice League . The character first appeared in All Star Comics # 8 in October 1941 with her first feature in Sensation Comics # 1 in January 1942 . The Wonder Woman title has been published by DC Comics almost continuously except for a brief hiatus in 1986 . In her homeland , the island nation of Themyscira , her official title is Princess Diana of Themyscira . When blending into the society outside of her homeland , she sometimes adopts her civilian identity Diana Prince . Wonder Woman was created by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston ( pen name : Charles Moulton ) , and artist Harry G. Peter . Marston 's wife , Elizabeth , and their life partner , Olive Byrne , are credited as being his inspiration for the character 's appearance . Marston 's comics featured his ideas on DISC theory , and the character drew a great deal of inspiration from early feminists , and especially from birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger ; in particular , her piece Woman and the New Race . Wonder Woman 's origin story relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother Queen Hippolyta and was given a life to live as an Amazon , along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods . In recent years , DC changed her background with the retcon that she is the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta , jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe . The character has changed in depiction over the decades , including briefly losing her powers entirely in the late 1960s ; by the 1980s , artist George Perez gave her an athletic look and emphasized her Amazonian heritage .",

  "/wiki/Flash_(Barry_Allen)": "The Flash ( Bartholomew Henry Barry Allen ) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics . The character first appeared in Showcase # 4 ( October 1956 ) , created by writer Robert Kanigher and penciler Carmine Infantino . Barry Allen is a reinvention of a previous character called the Flash , who appeared in 1940s comic books as the character Jay Garrick . Because he is a speedster , his power consists mainly of superhuman speed . Various other effects are also attributed to his ability to control the speed of molecular vibrations , including his ability to vibrate at speed to pass through objects . The Flash wears a distinct red and gold costume treated to resist friction and wind resistance , traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring . Barry Allen 's classic stories introduced the concept of the Multiverse to DC Comics , and this concept played a large part in DC 's various continuity reboots over the years . The Flash has traditionally always had a significant role in DC 's major company-wide reboot stories , and in the crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths # 8 ( Nov. 1985 ) , Barry Allen died saving the Multiverse , removing the character from the regular DC lineup for 23 years . His return to regular comics is foreshadowed during the narrative ( and a single image of a blur ) in Grant Morrison 's crossover story Final Crisis : Rogues ' Revenge # 3 ( Nov. 2008 ) , fully actualized in Geoff Johns ' accompanying The Flash : Rebirth # 1 ( June 2009 ) , kicking off a six-issue limited series . He has since played a pivotal role in the crossover stories Blackest Night ( 2009 ) , Flashpoint ( 2011 ) , Convergence ( 2015 ) , and DC Rebirth ( 2016 ) . Allen is the most well-known and commonly featured individual to take the mantle of the Flash , being present in numerous media adaptations , one-shots and comic-book story-arcs taking place in alternate universes . Barry Allen has been featured in several media , first appearing in animated form in the 1967 The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure and then in the related Super Friends program .",
  "/wiki/Flash_(comics)": "The Flash ( or simply Flash ) is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics . Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert , the original Flash first appeared in Flash Comics # 1 ( cover date January 1940/release month November 1939 ) . Nicknamed the Scarlet Speedster , all incarnations of the Flash possess super speed , which includes the ability to run , move , and think extremely fast , use superhuman reflexes , and seemingly violate certain laws of physics . Thus far , at least four different characters - each of whom somehow gained the power of the speed force - have assumed the mantle of the Flash in DC 's history : college athlete Jay Garrick ( 1940-1951 , 1961-2011 , 2017-present ) , forensic scientist Barry Allen ( 1956-1985 , 2008-present ) , Barry 's nephew Wally West ( 1986-2011 , 2016-present ) , and Barry 's grandson Bart Allen ( 2006-2007 ) . Each incarnation of the Flash has been a key member of at least one of DC 's premier teams : the Justice Society of America , the Justice League , and the Teen Titans . The Flash is one of DC Comics ' most popular characters and has been integral to the publisher 's many reality-changing crisis storylines over the years . The original meeting of the Golden Age Flash Jay Garrick and Silver Age Flash Barry Allen in Flash of Two Worlds ( 1961 ) introduced the Multiverse storytelling concept to DC readers , which would become the basis for many DC stories in the years to come . Like his Justice League colleagues Wonder Woman , Superman and Batman , the Flash has a distinctive cast of adversaries , including the various Rogues ( unique among DC supervillains for their code of honor ) and the various psychopathic speedsters who go by the names Reverse-Flash or Zoom . Other supporting characters in Flash stories include Barry 's wife Iris West , Wally 's wife Linda Park , Bart 's girlfriend Valerie Perez , friendly fellow speedster Max Mercury , and Central City police department members David Singh and Patty Spivot . A staple of the comic book DC Universe , the Flash has been adapted to numerous DC films , video games , animated series , and live-action television shows . In live-action , Barry Allen has been portrayed by Rod Haase for the 1979 television special Legends of the Superheroes , John Wesley Shipp in the 1990 The Flash series and Grant Gustin in the 2014 The Flash series , and by Ezra Miller in the DC Extended Universe series of films , beginning with Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice ( 2016 ) . Shipp also portrays a version of Jay Garrick in the 2014 The Flash series .",

Since their original 1961 introduction , the Fantastic Four have been portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional , yet loving , family .

  "/wiki/Spider-Man": "Spider-Man is a fictional superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko . He first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy # 15 ( August 1962 ) in the Silver Age of Comic Books . He appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics , as well as in a number of movies , television shows , and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe . In the stories , Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker , an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash . Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues , and accompanied him with many supporting characters , such as J. Jonah Jameson , Harry Osborn , Max Modell , romantic interests Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson , and foes such as Doctor Octopus , Green Goblin and Venom . His origin story has him acquiring spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider ; these include clinging to surfaces , shooting spider-webs from wrist-mounted devices , and detecting danger with his spider-sense . When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s , teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist . The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker , a high school student from Queens behind Spider-Man 's secret identity and with whose self-obsessions with rejection , inadequacy , and loneliness young readers could relate . While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick , unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin , Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman ; he thus had to learn for himself that with great power there must also come great responsibility - a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian , the late Uncle Ben . Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series , the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man . Over the years , the Peter Parker character developed from a shy , nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student , to married high school teacher to , in the late 2000s , a single freelance photographer . In the 2010s , he joins the Avengers , Marvel 's flagship superhero team .",
