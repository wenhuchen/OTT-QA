Wagner won his eighth ( and final ) batting title in 1911 , a National League record that remains unbroken to this day , and matched only once , in 1997 , by Tony Gwynn . He also led the league in slugging six times and stolen bases five times . Wagner was nicknamed The Flying Dutchman due to his superb speed and German heritage . This nickname was a nod to the popular folk-tale made into a famous opera by another Wagner . In 1936 , the Baseball Hall of Fame inducted Wagner as one of the first five members . He received the second-highest vote total , behind Ty Cobb and tied with Babe Ruth . Most baseball historians consider Wagner to be the greatest shortstop ever and one of the greatest players ever . Ty Cobb himself called Wagner maybe the greatest star ever to take the diamond . Honus Wagner is also the featured player of one of the rarest and the most valuable baseball cards in existence .",
