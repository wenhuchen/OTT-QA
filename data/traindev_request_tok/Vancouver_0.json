A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate ( the place where the player started as a batter ) . The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner . The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely . A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called out can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner , either immediately or during teammates ' turns batting . The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners out , which forces them out of the field of play . Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team 's players out . The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding ; the batting team 's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs .

  "/wiki/Overwatch_League": "The Overwatch League ( OWL ) is a professional esports league for the video game Overwatch , produced by its developer Blizzard Entertainment . The Overwatch League follows the model of other traditional North American professional sporting leagues by using a set of permanent , city-based teams backed by separate ownership groups . In addition , the league plays in the regular season and playoffs format rather than the use of promotion and relegation used commonly in other esports and non-North American leagues , with players on the roster being assured a minimum annual salary , benefits , and a portion of winnings and revenue-sharing based on how that team performs . The League was announced in 2016 with its inaugural season taking place in 2018 , with a total prize pool of US $ 3.5 million given to teams that year .",
  "/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)": "Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment . Described as a hero shooter , Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six , with each player selecting from a roster of over 30 characters , known as heroes , each with a unique style of play that is divided into three general roles that fit their purpose . Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time . Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay , such as character skins and victory poses , as they play the game . The game was initially launched with only casual play , but a competitive ranked mode , various 'arcade ' game modes , and a player-customizable server browser were added after release . Additionally , Blizzard has added new characters , maps , and game modes post-release , all free of charge , with the only additional cost to players being optional loot boxes to earn cosmetic items . It was released for PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , and Windows in May 2016 , and Nintendo Switch in October 2019 . Overwatch is Blizzard 's fourth major franchise and came about following the 2014 cancellation of the ambitious massively multiplayer online role-playing game Titan . A portion of the Titan team came up with the concept of Overwatch , based on the success of team-based first-person shooters like Team Fortress 2 and the popularity of multiplayer online battle arena games , creating a hero-based shooter that emphasized teamwork . Some elements of Overwatch borrow assets and concepts from the canceled Titan project . After establishing the narrative of an optimistic near-future Earth setting after a global crisis , the developers aimed to create a diverse cast of heroes that spanned genders and ethnicities as part of this setting . Significant time is spent adjusting the balance of the characters , making sure that new players would still be able to have fun while skilled players would present each other with a challenge .",
