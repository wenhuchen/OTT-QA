  "/wiki/College_football": "College football is gridiron football consisting of American football played by teams of student athletes fielded by American universities , colleges , and military academies , or Canadian football played by teams of student athletes fielded by Canadian universities . It was through college football play that American football rules first gained popularity in the United States .

However , in some areas of the country , college football is more popular than professional football , and for much of the early 20th century , college football was seen as more prestigious than professional football . It is in college football where a player 's performance directly impacts his chances of playing professional football . The best collegiate players will typically declare for the professional draft after three to four years of collegiate competition , with the NFL holding its annual draft every spring in which 256 players are selected annually .

  "/wiki/Golf": "Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible . Golf , unlike most ball games , can not and does not utilize a standardized playing area , and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game . The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes , though recreational courses can be smaller , often having nine holes . Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from , and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4 1\u20444 inches ( 11 cm ) in diameter . There are other standard forms of terrain in between , such as the fairway , rough ( long grass ) , bunkers ( or sand traps ) , and various hazards ( water , rocks ) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement . Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual , known as stroke play , or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team , known as match play . Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels , but most especially at the elite level . The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland . The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764 . Golf 's first major , and the world 's oldest tournament in existence , is The Open Championship , also known as the British Open , which was first played in 1860 in Ayrshire , Scotland . This is one of the four major championships in men 's professional golf , the other three being played in the United States : The Masters , the U.S. Open , and the PGA Championship .",

In comparison to football and basketball , college competition in the United States plays a smaller role in developing professional players , as baseball 's professional minor leagues are more extensive , with a greater history of supplying players to the top professional league . Moving directly from high school to the professional level is more common in baseball than in football or basketball . However , if players do opt to enroll at a four-year college to play baseball , they must complete three years to regain professional eligibility , unless they reach age 21 before starting their third year of college . Players who enroll at junior colleges ( i.e. , two-year institutions ) regain eligibility after one year at that level . In the most recently completed 2017 season , there were 298 NCAA Division I teams in the United States ( including schools transitioning from Division II to Division I ) . As with most other U.S. intercollegiate sports , competitive college baseball is played under the auspices of either the NCAA , the NAIA , or the NJCAA .
