  "/wiki/Progressive_Party_of_Manitoba": "The Progressive Party of Manitoba , Canada , was a political party that developed from the United Farmers of Manitoba ( UFM ) , an agrarian movement that became politically active following World War I . A successor to the Manitoba Grain Growers ' Association , the UFM represented the interests of farmers frustrated with traditional political parties . Unlike the United Farmers , the Progressive Party of Manitoba never made any serious effort to cooperate with the labour politicians . The Winnipeg General Strike was unpopular among farmers , and the Progressive Party of Manitoba was not generally regarded as friendly to labour . A number of farmer candidates ran in Manitoba 's provincial election of 1920 . They were not an organized group , and had no pretensions of forming government ; nevertheless , twelve of these candidates were elected - eight as supporters of the UFM , and four as independents . Had the UFM run a united campaign , it probably would have won the election . The Independent-Farmers group was formed to represent the victorious candidates in the parliament which followed . This was never intended to be a permanent political organization , and dissolved when parliament broke up in 1922 . The group 's leader was William Robson , who did not seek re-election thereafter . The United Farmers of Manitoba entered electoral politics in 1921 , and ran an organized campaign in the 1922 election . However , expectations were still very low .",

The ILP fell to six seats in the election of 1922 , and Dixon resigned from the legislature in 1923 following a family tragedy .

Boivin served as a backbench supporter of John Bracken 's administration , and was re-elected as a pro-government independent candidate in the elections of 1927 and 1932 . Prior to the 1932 election , the Progressive Party of Manitoba joined with the Manitoba Liberal Party to form a Liberal-Progressive alliance . This alliance was made permanent after the election , though it did not always prevent Liberals and Progressives from running against one another in specific constituencies . Boivin was challenged by a pro-government Liberal named John Lamont in the 1936 election , and lost by 132 votes . Again campaigning as a pro-government independent candidate , Boivin challenged Lamont in the 1941 provincial election and won without difficulty .",
