He rose to prominence as a pioneer of the 1960s French New Wave film movement . During his early career as a film critic , Godard criticized mainstream French cinema 's Tradition of Quality , which emphasized established convention over innovation and experimentation . In response , he and like-minded critics began to make their own films . Many of Godard 's films challenge the conventions of traditional Hollywood in addition to French cinema . In 1964 , Godard described his and his colleagues ' impact : We barged into the cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis XV . He is often considered the most radical French filmmaker of the 1960s and 1970s ; his approach in film conventions , politics and philosophies made him arguably the most influential director of the French New Wave . Along with showing knowledge of film history through homages and references , several of his films expressed his political views ; he was an avid reader of existential and Marxist philosophy . Since the New Wave , his politics have been much less radical and his recent films are about representation and human conflict from a humanist , and a Marxist perspective . In a 2002 Sight & Sound poll , Godard ranked third in the critics ' top ten directors of all time ( which was put together by assembling the directors of the individual films for which the critics voted ) . He is said to have created one of the largest bodies of critical analysis of any filmmaker since the mid-twentieth century . He and his work have been central to narrative theory and have challenged both commercial narrative cinema norms and film criticism 's vocabulary .",

Andersson said he imagined that the birds in the scene are watching the people below , wondering what they are doing . He explained the title of the film as a different way of saying 'what are we actually doing ' , that 's what the movie is about . At the Venice Film Festival , Andersson said that the film had been inspired by the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves by Vittorio De Sica .",
