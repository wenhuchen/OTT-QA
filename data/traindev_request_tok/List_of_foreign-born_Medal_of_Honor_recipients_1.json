The alternative spelling , serjeant , is used in The Rifles and other units that draw their heritage from the British Light Infantry . Its origin is the Latin serviens , 'one who serves ' , through the French term sergent . The term sergeant refers to a non-commissioned officer placed above the rank of a corporal and a police officer immediately below a lieutenant or , in the UK Police forces , below an inspector . In most armies the rank of sergeant corresponds to command of a squad ( or section ) . In Commonwealth armies , it is a more senior rank , corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command . In the United States Army , sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a four-soldier fireteam leader . More senior non-commissioned ranks are often variations on sergeant , for example staff sergeant , first sergeant , and sergeant major . Many countries use sergeant rank , whether in English or using a cognate with the same origin in another language .

On May 31 , Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston attempted to overwhelm two Federal corps that appeared isolated south of the Chickahominy River . The Confederate assaults , although not well coordinated , succeeded in driving back the IV Corps and inflicting heavy casualties . Reinforcements arrived , and both sides fed more and more troops into the action . Supported by the III Corps and Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick 's division of Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner 's II Corps ( which crossed the rain-swollen river on Grapevine Bridge ) , the Federal position was finally stabilized . Gen. Johnston was seriously wounded during the action , and command of the Confederate army devolved temporarily to Maj. Gen. G.W . Smith . On June 1 , the Confederates renewed their assaults against the Federals , who had brought up more reinforcements , but made little headway . Both sides claimed victory . Although the battle was tactically inconclusive , it was the largest battle in the Eastern Theater up to that time ( and second only to Shiloh in terms of casualties thus far , about 11,000 total ) . Gen. Johnston 's injury also had profound influence on the war : it led to the appointment of Robert E. Lee as Confederate commander .",

The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay , which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna . The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond ; Virginia Beach is the most populous city , and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision . The Commonwealth 's estimated population as of 2018 [ update ] is over 8.5 million . The area 's history begins with several indigenous groups , including the Powhatan . In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World . Virginia 's state nickname , the Old Dominion , is a reference to this status . Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony 's early politics and plantation economy . Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution . In the American Civil War , Virginia 's Secession Convention resolved to join the Confederacy , and Virginia 's First Wheeling Convention resolved to remain in the Union ; that led to the creation of West Virginia . Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction , both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia .

  "/wiki/Battle_of_Stones_River": "The Battle of Stones River ( also known as the Second Battle of Murfreesboro ) was a battle fought from December 31 , 1862 , to January 2 , 1863 , in Middle Tennessee , as the culmination of the Stones River Campaign in the Western Theater of the American Civil War . Of the major battles of the war , Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties on both sides . Although the battle itself was inconclusive , the Union Army 's repulse of two Confederate attacks and the subsequent Confederate withdrawal were a much-needed boost to Union morale after the defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg , and it dashed Confederate aspirations for control of Middle Tennessee . Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans 's Army of the Cumberland marched from Nashville , Tennessee , on December 26 , 1862 , to challenge General Braxton Bragg 's Army of Tennessee at Murfreesboro . On December 31 , each army commander planned to attack his opponent 's right flank , but Bragg struck first . A massive assault by the corps of Maj. Gen. William J. Hardee , followed by that of Leonidas Polk , overran the wing commanded by Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook . A stout defense by the division of Brig . Gen. Philip Sheridan in the right center of the line prevented a total collapse , and the Union assumed a tight defensive position backing up to the Nashville Turnpike . Repeated Confederate attacks were repulsed from this concentrated line , most notably in the cedar Round Forest salient against the brigade of Col. William B. Hazen . Bragg attempted to continue the assault with the division of Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge , but the troops were slow in arriving and their multiple piecemeal attacks failed . Fighting resumed on January 2 , 1863 , when Bragg ordered Breckinridge to assault the well-fortified Union position on a hill to the east of the Stones River . Faced with overwhelming artillery , the Confederates were repulsed with heavy losses .",

The city is just 21 miles ( 34 km ) south of the historic commonwealth ( state ) capital city of Richmond . The city 's unique industrial past and its location as a transportation hub combined to create wealth for Virginia and the Middle Atlantic and Upper South regions of the nation . Early in the colonial era of the 18th century , Petersburg was the final destination on the Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System because of its location on the Appomattox River with its connection to the James River to the east at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line ( the head of navigation of rivers on the U.S. East Coast ) and the tying in with the James River shipping traffic was a strategic place for transportation and commercial activities . It connected commerce as far inland as Farmville , Virginia at the foothills of the Blue Ridge and the Appalachian Mountains chain , to shipping further east into the Chesapeake Bay and North Atlantic Ocean . For similar reasons , 17th century era Fort Henry was built at the order of the Virginia House of Burgesses at Petersburg in 1645 to protect the river traffic . As railroads were being constructed and extended in the state in the 1830s and 1840s , Petersburg was developed as a major transfer point for both north-south and east-west competitors .
