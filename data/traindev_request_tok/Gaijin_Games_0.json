  "/wiki/Bit.Trip_Beat": "Bit.Trip Beat , marketed as BIT.TRIP BEAT , is an arcade-style music video game developed by Gaijin Games and published by Aksys Games for the Wii 's WiiWare download service . It was released in 2009 in North America , and released in Japan and PAL regions in the same year . It was later released for the Windows and Mac OS X through the download service Steam in 2010 , while Namco Bandai published it for iOS on iPod Touch , iPhone , and iPad in both Bit.Trip Beat and Bit.Trip Beat HD versions . Android and Linux versions debuted in the Humble Android Bundle 3 . The WiiWare version is controlled by tilting the Wii Remote while holding it on its side . Players are placed in control of a paddle on the left side of the screen which , much like Pong , is tasked with deflecting squares that are coming from the right side . Each successful hit creates a sound effect that contributes to the background music , which was composed by an anonymous composer at Petrified Productions . A soundtrack was eventually released for the game 's music , including some songs by micromusican Bit Shifter who composed the Title Screen and Credits music . Since its release , Bit.Trip Beat received generally positive reception , holding an 80 and 80.15% from Metacritic and GameRankings , respectively . Wired named it the fifth best Wii game of 2009 , while IGN named it the eighth best WiiWare game . The most common praise for it was what multiple reviewers describe as addictive gameplay , stylish visuals , and a great soundtrack . However , certain reviewers criticized its short game length and high level of difficulty .",
  "/wiki/Wii": "The Wii ( /wi\u02d0/ WEE ; known unofficially as the Nintendo Wii ) is a home video game console released by Nintendo on November 19 , 2006 . As a seventh-generation console , the Wii competed with Microsoft 's Xbox 360 and Sony 's PlayStation 3 . Nintendo states that its console targets a broader demographic than that of the two others . As of the first quarter of 2016 [ update ] , the Wii led its generation over the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in worldwide sales , with more than 101 million units sold ; in December 2009 , the console broke the sales record for a single month in the United States . The Wii introduced the Wii Remote controller , which can be used as a handheld pointing device and which detects movement in three dimensions . The console runs games supplied on Wii optical discs . It also supported the now discontinued WiiConnect24 service , which enabled Wii to receive messages and updates over the Internet while in standby mode . Like other seventh-generation consoles it supported a service , called Virtual Console , that downloaded emulated games from past Nintendo consoles , support for online video streaming such as BBC iPlayer , and other services provided by Nintendo over the Internet . From June 28 , 2013 , Internet services were gradually discontinued ; since January 31 , 2019 , only re-download of games , system software update , and transfer of data between Wii and Wii U continued to be available , to be withdrawn at an unspecified future date . Wii Points could no longer be purchased after March 2018 , and could not be used and were permanently lost from January 31 , 2019 . The Wii succeeded the GameCube ; early models are fully backward-compatible with all GameCube games and most accessories . Nintendo first spoke of the console at the E3 2004 press conference and later unveiled it at E3 2005 .",
  "/wiki/IOS_(Apple)": "iOS ( formerly iPhone OS ) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware . It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company 's mobile devices , including the iPhone , and iPod Touch ; it also powered the iPad prior to the introduction of iPadOS in 2019 . It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android . Originally unveiled in 2007 for the iPhone , iOS has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch ( September 2007 ) and the iPad ( January 2010 ) . As of March 2018 [ update ] , Apple 's App Store contains more than 2.1 million iOS applications , 1 million of which are native for iPads . These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times . The iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation , using multi-touch gestures . Interface control elements consist of sliders , switches , and buttons . Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe , tap , pinch , and reverse pinch , all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface . Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device ( one common result is the undo command ) or rotating it in three dimensions ( one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode ) . Apple has been significantly praised for incorporating thorough accessibility functions into iOS , enabling users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use its products . Major versions of iOS are released annually .",
  "/wiki/Microsoft_Windows": "Microsoft Windows , commonly referred to as Windows , is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families , all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft . Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry . Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT ; these may encompass subfamilies , e.g . Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact ( Windows CE ) . Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x , Windows Mobile and Windows Phone . Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20 , 1985 , as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world 's personal computer ( PC ) market with over 90% market share , overtaking Mac OS , which had been introduced in 1984 . Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh ( eventually settled in court in Microsoft 's favor in 1993 ) . On PCs , Windows is still the most popular operating system . However , in 2014 , Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android , because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones . In 2014 , the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold . This comparison , however , may not be fully relevant , as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms .",
  "/wiki/OS_X": "macOS ( /\u02ccm\u00e6ko\u028a\u02c8\u025bs/ ; previously Mac OS X and later OS X ) is a series of proprietary graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001 . It is the primary operating system for Apple 's Mac computers . Within the market of desktop , laptop and home computers , and by web usage , it is the second most widely used desktop OS , after Microsoft Windows . macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems . The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS , which was introduced in 1984 , and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999 . The first desktop version , Mac OS X 10.0 , was released in March 2001 , with its first update , 10.1 , arriving later that year . After this , Apple began naming its releases after big cats , which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion . Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks , releases have been named after locations in California . Apple shortened the name to OS X in 2012 and then changed it to macOS in 2016 , adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems , iOS , watchOS , and tvOS . The latest version is macOS Catalina , which was publicly released in October 2019 . Between 1999 and 2009 , Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server . The initial version , Mac OS X Server 1.0 , was released in 1999 with a user interface similar to Mac OS 8.5 .",
  "/wiki/Linux": "Linux ( /\u02c8l\u026an\u0259ks/ ( listen ) LIN-\u0259ks ) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel , an operating system kernel first released on September 17 , 1991 , by Linus Torvalds . Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution . Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project . Many Linux distributions use the word Linux in their name , but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software , causing some controversy . Popular Linux distributions include Debian , Fedora , and Ubuntu . Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland , and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma . Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether , or include a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any purpose . Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system . Linux is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers ( since November 2017 , having gradually eliminated all competitors ) . It is used by around 2.3 percent of desktop computers .",

It was first released in Japan in 2009 , and later in North America and PAL regions in 2009 and 2010 , respectively . It was designed by Alex Neuse and Chris Osborn , while the visuals were designed by Mike Roush . While initially having what they now describe as noisy audio and visuals , they changed them to be more minimalistic to alleviate this , a decision which worked well with their minimalistic design for the HUD . Neuse designed it so that it could be open to interpretation by players , though stating that they intended it to delve into starring character Commander Video 's psyche , and what it means to have emotions and personal space . It puts players in control of a void , and represents the end of Commander Video 's first chapter . Players move the void around with the joystick of either the Classic Controller or the Nunchuk , attempting to collect all of the black squares that appear , causing the void to grow ; however , if hit players hit a white square , the void will be reduced to its regular size . Players are also able to reduce their void in size to avoid the white blocks . It features a heavy emphasis on retro-styled visuals and audio , with the audio composed by electronic musician Nullsleep . It was followed by three more games in the series , all developed by Gaijin Games : Bit.Trip Runner , Bit.Trip Fate , and Bit.Trip Flux .
