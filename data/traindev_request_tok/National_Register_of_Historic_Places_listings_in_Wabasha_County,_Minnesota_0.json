  "/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration": "The Works Progress Administration ( WPA ; renamed in 1939 as the Work Projects Administration ) was an American New Deal agency , employing millions of job-seekers ( mostly unskilled men ) to carry out public works projects , including the construction of public buildings and roads . It was established on May 6 , 1935 , by Executive Order 7034 . In one project , Federal Project Number One , the WPA employed musicians , artists , writers , actors and directors in large arts , drama , media , and literacy projects . The five projects dedicated to these were : the Federal Writers Project ( FWP ) , the Historical Records Survey ( HRS ) , the Federal Theatre Project ( FTP ) , the Federal Music Project ( FMP ) , and the Federal Art Project ( FAP ) . In the Historical Records Survey , for instance , many former slaves in the South were interviewed ; these documents are of great importance for American history . Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States , and gave more than 225,000 performances . Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre-Columbian Native American cultures , and the development of professional archaeology in the US . The WPA 's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $ 4.9 billion ( about 6.7 percent of the 1935 GDP ) . Headed by Harry Hopkins , the WPA provided jobs and income to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States , while developing infrastructure to support the current and future society . Above all , the WPA hired workers and craftsmen who were mainly employed in building streets . Thus , under the leadership of the WPA , more than 1 million km of streets and over 10,000 bridges were built , in addition to many airports and much housing . The largest single project of the WPA was the Tennessee Valley Authority , which provided the impoverished Tennessee Valley with dams and waterworks to create an infrastructure for electrical power .",

  "/wiki/English_Gothic_architecture": "English Gothic is an architectural style , which originated in France and flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 . As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires . The Gothic style was introduced from France , where the various elements had first been used together within a single building at the choir of the Basilique Saint-Denis north of Paris , built by the Abbot Suger and dedicated on 11 June 1144 . The earliest large-scale applications of Gothic architecture in England are at Canterbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey . Many features of Gothic architecture had evolved naturally from Romanesque architecture ( often known in England as Norman architecture ) . This evolution can be seen most particularly at the Norman Durham Cathedral , which has the earliest pointed ribbed high vault known . English Gothic was to develop along lines that sometimes paralleled and sometimes diverged from those of continental Europe . Historians traditionally divide English Gothic into a number of different periods , which may be further subdivided to accurately define different styles . Gothic architecture continued to flourish in England for a hundred years after the precepts of Renaissance architecture were formalised in Florence in the early 15th century . The Gothic style gave way to the Renaissance in the later 16th and 17th centuries , but was revived in the late 18th century as an academic style and had great popularity as Gothic Revival architecture throughout the 19th century . Many of the largest and finest works of English architecture , notably the medieval cathedrals of England , are largely built in the Gothic style . So are numerous castles , palaces , great houses , universities , and many smaller unpretentious secular buildings , including almshouses and trade halls .",
  "/wiki/Cass_Gilbert": "Cass Gilbert ( November 24 , 1859 - May 17 , 1934 ) was a prominent American architect . An early proponent of skyscrapers , his works include the Woolworth Building , the United States Supreme Court building , the state capitols of Minnesota , Arkansas and West Virginia ; and the Saint Louis Art Museum and Public Library . His public buildings in the Beaux Arts style reflect the optimistic American sense that the nation was heir to Greek democracy , Roman law and Renaissance humanism . Gilbert 's achievements were recognized in his lifetime ; he served as president of the American Institute of Architects in 1908-09 . Gilbert was a conservative who believed architecture should reflect historic traditions and the established social order . His design of the new Supreme Court building ( 1935 ) , with its classical lines and small size , contrasted sharply with the large federal buildings going up along the National Mall in Washington , D.C. , which he disliked . Heilbrun says Gilbert 's pioneering buildings injected vitality into skyscraper design , and his 'Gothic skyscraper , ' epitomized by the Woolworth Building , profoundly influenced architects during the first decades of the twentieth century . Christen and Flanders note that his reputation among architectural critics went into eclipse during the age of modernism , but has since rebounded because of respect for the integrity and classic beauty of his masterworks .",

  "/wiki/Biofact_(archaeology)": "In archaeology , a biofact ( or ecofact ) is organic material found at an archaeological site that carries archaeological significance . Biofacts are natural objects found alongside artifacts or features , such as animal bones , charcoal , plants , and pollen . Biofacts are passively consumed or handled by humans ; as opposed to artifacts , which are purposefully manipulated . Biofacts reveal how people respond to their surroundings . A common type of biofact is a plant seed . Plant remains , often referred to as macrobotanicals , provide a variety of information ranging from diet to medicine to textile production . Pollen preserved on archaeological sites informs researchers about the ancient environment , and the foods processed and/or grown by prehistoric people . Pollen , when examined over time , also informs on environmental and dietary changes . A seed can be linked to the species of plant that produced it ; if massive numbers of seeds of a cultivated species are found at a site , it may be inferred that the species may have been grown for food or other products that are useful to humans , such as clothing , bedding or building materials . Another type of biofact is wood . Wood is made up cellulose , carbohydrates , and lignin . Every year that passes , a new ring is added to the trunk of tree , allowing for dendrochronological dating .",

The facility consists of a gravity dam and a powerhouse , and the impoundment created is called Lake Zumbro . This dam spans 440 feet ( 130 m ) and is 60 feet ( 18 m ) high , creating a reservoir with about 55 feet ( 17 m ) of hydraulic head . The facility was designed by pioneering hydroelectric engineer Hugh Lincoln Cooper ( 1865-1937 ) and was built from 1917 to 1919 .

In 2015 , hydropower generated 16.6% of the world 's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity , and was expected to increase by about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years . Hydropower is produced in 150 countries , with the Asia-Pacific region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013 . China is the largest hydroelectricity producer , with 920 TWh of production in 2013 , representing 16.9% of domestic electricity use . The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low , making it a competitive source of renewable electricity . The hydro station consumes no water , unlike coal or gas plants . The typical cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour . With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity , since the amount produced by the station can be varied up or down very rapidly ( as little as a few seconds ) to adapt to changing energy demands . Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed , the project produces no direct waste , and it generally has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than photovoltaic power plants and certainly fossil fuel powered energy plants ( see also Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources ) .

Carpenter Gothic improvises upon features that were carved in stone in authentic Gothic architecture , whether original or in more scholarly revival styles ; however , in the absence of the restraining influence of genuine Gothic structures , the style was freed to improvise and emphasize charm and quaintness rather than fidelity to received models . The genre received its impetus from the publication by Alexander Jackson Davis of Rural Residences and from detailed plans and elevations in publications by Andrew Jackson Downing .",

  "/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture": "The Greek Revival was an architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States . It revived the style of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the Greek temple , with varying degrees of thoroughness and consistency . A product of Hellenism , it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture , which had for long mainly drawn from Roman architecture . The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as Professor of Architecture to the Royal Academy of Arts , London in 1842 . With a newfound access to Greece , or initially the books produced by the few who had actually been able to visit the sites , archaeologist-architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders . In each country it touched , the style was looked on as the expression of local nationalism and civic virtue , and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that was thought to characterize the architecture of France and Italy , two countries where the style never really took hold . This was especially the case in Britain , Germany and the United States , where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations . The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design , sometimes called Neo-Grec , was at its peak by the beginning of the 19th century , when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical , Empire , Russian Empire , and Regency architecture in Britain . Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries , lasting until the Civil War in America ( 1860s ) and even later in Scotland ."
