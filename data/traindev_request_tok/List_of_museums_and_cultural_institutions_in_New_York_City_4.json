  "/wiki/American_Jews": "American Jews , or Jewish Americans , are Americans who are Jews , whether by religion , ethnicity , culture , or nationality . Today the Jewish community in the United States consists primarily of Ashkenazi Jews , who descend from diaspora Jewish populations of Central and Eastern Europe and comprise about 90-95% of the American Jewish population . Most American Ashkenazim are US-born , with a dwindling number of now-elderly earlier immigrants , as well as some more recent foreign-born immigrants . During the colonial era , prior to the mass immigration of Ashkenazim , Spanish and Portuguese Jews represented the bulk of America 's then-small Jewish population , and while their descendants are a minority today , they , along with an array of other Jewish communities , represented the remainder of American Jews , including other more recent Sephardic Jews , Mizrahi Jews , various other ethnically Jewish communities , as well as a smaller number of converts to Judaism . The American Jewish community manifests a wide range of Jewish cultural traditions , encompassing the full spectrum of Jewish religious observance . Depending on religious definitions and varying population data , the United States has the largest or second largest Jewish community in the world , after Israel . In 2012 , the American Jewish population was estimated at between 5.5 million and eight million , depending on the definition of the term , which constitutes between 1.7% and 2.6% of the total U.S. population .",

One of the most discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust , she gained fame posthumously with the publication of The Diary of a Young Girl ( originally Het Achterhuis in Dutch ; English : The Secret Annex ) , in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944 , during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II . It is one of the world 's best known books and has been the basis for several plays and films . Born in Frankfurt , Germany , she lived most of her life in or near Amsterdam , Netherlands , having moved there with her family at the age of four and a half when the Nazis gained control over Germany . Born a German national , she lost her citizenship in 1941 and thus became stateless . By May 1940 , the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands . As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942 , the Franks went into hiding in some concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where Anne 's father , Otto Frank , worked . From then until the family 's arrest by the Gestapo in August 1944 , she kept a diary she had received as a birthday present , and wrote in it regularly . Following their arrest , the Franks were transported to concentration camps . In October or November 1944 , Anne and her sister , Margot , were transferred from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp , where they died ( probably of typhus ) a few months later . They were originally estimated by the Red Cross to have died in March , with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as their official date of death , but research by the Anne Frank House in 2015 suggests it is more likely that they died in February . Otto , the only survivor of the Franks , returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that her diary had been saved by his secretary , Miep Gies , and his efforts led to its publication in 1947 .",

  "/wiki/Torah": "Torah can most specifically mean the first five books ( Pentateuch or five books of Moses ) of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh . It can also mean the continued narrative from all 24 books of the Hebrew Bible , and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching , culture , and practice , whether derived from biblical texts or later rabbinic writings . If in bound book form , it is usually printed with the rabbinic commentaries ( perushim ) . If meant for liturgic purposes , it takes the form of a Torah scroll ( sefer Torah ) , which contains strictly the five books of Moses . In rabbinic literature the word Torah denotes both the five books ( Hebrew : \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05db\u05ea\u05d1 Torah that is written ) and the Oral Torah ( \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05d4 , Torah that is spoken ) . The Oral Torah consists of interpretations and amplifications which according to rabbinic tradition have been handed down from generation to generation and are now embodied in the Talmud and Midrash . Rabbinic tradition 's understanding is that all of the teachings found in the Torah ( both written and oral ) were given by God through the prophet Moses , some at Mount Sinai and others at the Tabernacle , and all the teachings were written down by Moses , which resulted in the Torah that exists today . According to the Midrash , the Torah was created prior to the creation of the world , and was used as the blueprint for Creation . The majority of Biblical scholars believe that the written books were a product of the Babylonian captivity ( c. 6th century BCE ) , based on earlier written sources and oral traditions , and that it was completed with final revisions during the post-Exilic period ( c. 5th century BCE ) . Traditionally , the words of the Torah are written on a scroll by a scribe ( sofer ) in Hebrew . A Torah portion is read publicly at least once every three days in the presence of a congregation . Reading the Torah publicly is one of the bases of Jewish communal life .",
