  "/wiki/Cornerback": "A cornerback ( CB ) is a member of the defensive backfield or secondary in gridiron football .

They create turnovers through hard tackles , interceptions , and deflecting forward passes . Other members of the defensive backfield include strong and free safeties . The cornerback position requires speed , agility , and strength . A cornerback 's skill set typically requires proficiency in anticipating the quarterback , backpedaling , executing single and zone coverage , disrupting pass routes , block shedding , and tackling . Cornerbacks are among the fastest players on the field .",
  "/wiki/Virginia_Cavaliers_football": "The Virginia Cavaliers football team represents the University of Virginia in the sport of American football . Established in 1888 , Virginia plays its home games at Scott Stadium , capacity 61,500 , featured prominently at the center of its campus near the Academical Village . UVA played an outsized role in the shaping of the modern game 's ethics and eligibility rules as well as its safety rules , after a Georgia fullback died fighting the tide of a lopsided Virginia victory in 1897 . Quickly asserting itself as the South 's first great program with 28 straight winning seasons from its first in 1888 , Virginia football claimed 12 southern championships and was the first program outside the Northeast to defeat perennial power ( 26-time national champions ) Yale , on the first attempt in 1915 . [ a ] During those early days , Virginia established long-lasting rivalries that still continue on : particularly the South 's Oldest Rivalry with North Carolina and a heated rivalry with VPI ( now Virginia Tech ) . Virginia has also played William & Mary annually or biennially for extended stretches since 1908 . [ b ] Virginia lost its mantle as the region 's mark of success between World War I and World War II , but soon thereafter Art Guepe had Virginia winning big again . To avoid the trappings of big-time football , [ c ] university president Colgate Darden reduced scholarship and recruiting support , argued against joining the ACC , and declined an invite for Virginia to play unbeaten Georgia Tech in the 1952 Orange Bowl . [ d ] The Board of Visitors voted to join the ACC anyway , but Guepe left for Vanderbilt and Virginia soon embarked on a 28-game losing streak from 1958 to 1960 as Darden retired . Virginia became the worst ACC football team of the 1970s . [ e ] George Welsh led a dramatic turnaround effort from 1982 , and took Virginia to its first dozen bowl games and even its first AP No . 1 rankings throughout October 1990 .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

  "/wiki/Tight_end": "The tight end ( TE ) is a position in American football , arena football , and formerly Canadian football , on the offense . The tight end is often seen as a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver . Like offensive linemen , they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers . On the other hand , unlike offensive linemen , they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense 's attention when running pass patterns . Because of the hybrid nature of the position , the tight end 's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach . In some systems , the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman , rarely going out for passes . Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver , frequently taking advantage of the tight end 's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary . Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations . Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time .",

  "/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)": "A fullback ( FB ) is a position known as the best position in the game of football , in the offensive backfield in gridiron football , and is one of the two running back positions along with the halfback . Typically , fullbacks are larger than halfback and in most offensive schemes their duties are split between power running , pass catching , and blocking for both the quarterback and the other running back . Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks , including Jim Brown , Marion Motley , Jim Taylor , Franco Harris , Larry Csonka , John Riggins , Christian Okoye , and Levi Jackson . However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks . Examples of players who have excelled at the hybrid running-blocking-pass catching role include Mike Alstott , Daryl Johnston , and Lorenzo Neal .",
