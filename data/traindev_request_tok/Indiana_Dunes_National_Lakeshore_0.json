  "/wiki/North_American_cougar": "The North American cougar ( Puma concolor couguar ) is a subspecies of cougar in North America . It was once commonly found in eastern North America , and is still prevalent in the western half of the continent . It is the biggest cat in North America . The subspecies P. c. cougar encompasses populations found in western Canada , the western United States , Florida , Mexico and Central America , and possibly South America northwest of the Andes Mountains . The population in Costa Rica had been listed as least concern by the IUCN Red List .",
  "/wiki/American_bison": "The American bison or simply bison ( Bison bison ) , also commonly known as the American buffalo or simply buffalo , is a North American species of bison that once roamed North America in vast herds . Its historical range , by 9000 BCE , is described as the great bison belt , a tract of rich grassland that ran from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico , east to the Atlantic Seaboard ( nearly to the Atlantic tidewater in some areas ) as far north as New York and south to Georgia and , according to some sources , down to Florida , with sightings in North Carolina near Buffalo Ford on the Catawba River as late as 1750 . It nearly became extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle . With a population in excess of 60 million in the late 18th century , the species was down to 541 animals by 1889 . Recovery efforts expanded in the mid-20th century , with a resurgence to roughly 31,000 animals today , largely restricted to a few national parks and reserves . Two subspecies or ecotypes have been described : the plains bison ( B. b. bison ) , smaller in size and with a more rounded hump , and the wood bison ( B. b. athabascae ) - the larger of the two and having a taller , square hump . Furthermore , the plains bison has been suggested to consist of a northern plains ( B. b. montanae ) and a southern plains ( B. b. bison ) subspecies , bringing the total to three . However , this is generally not supported . The wood bison is one of the largest wild species of bovid in the world , surpassed by only the Asian gaur and wild yak . Among extant land animals in North America , the bison is the heaviest and the longest , and the second tallest after the moose . Spanning back many centuries , Native American tribes have had cultural and spiritual connections to the American bison . It is the national mammal of the United States .",
  "/wiki/Elk": "The elk or wapiti ( Cervus canadensis ) is one of the largest species within the deer family , Cervidae , and one of the largest terrestrial mammals in North America and Northeast Asia . This animal should not be confused with the still larger Alces alces , known as the moose in America , but as the elk in British English and in reference to populations in Eurasia . Elk range in forest and forest-edge habitat , feeding on grasses , plants , leaves , and bark . Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year . Males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during the rut , including posturing , antler wrestling ( sparring ) , and bugling , a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females . Although they are native to North America and eastern Asia , they have adapted well to countries in which they have been introduced , including Argentina and New Zealand . Their great adaptability may threaten endemic species and ecosystems into which they have been introduced . Elk are susceptible to a number of infectious diseases , some of which can be transmitted to livestock . Efforts to eliminate infectious diseases from elk populations , largely by vaccination , have had mixed success . Some cultures revere the elk as a spiritual force . In parts of Asia , antlers and their velvet are used in traditional medicines . Elk are hunted as a game species .",
  "/wiki/Lynx": "A lynx ( /l\u026a\u014bks/ ; plural lynx or lynxes ) is any of the four species ( Canada lynx , Iberian lynx , Eurasian lynx , bobcat ) within the medium-sized wild cat genus Lynx . The name lynx originated in Middle English via Latin from the Greek word \u03bb\u03cd\u03b3\u03be , derived from the Indo-European root leuk- ( 'light , brightness ' ) in reference to the luminescence of its reflective eyes . Two other cats that are sometimes called lynxes , the caracal ( desert lynx ) and the jungle cat ( jungle lynx ) , are not members of the genus Lynx .",
  "/wiki/Bobcat": "The bobcat ( Lynx rufus ) is a medium-sized North American cat that first appeared during the Irvingtonian stage around 1.8 million years ago ( AEO ) . Containing two recognized subspecies , it ranges from southern Canada to central Mexico , including most of the contiguous United States . The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas , as well as semidesert , urban edge , forest edge , and swampland environments . It remains in some of its original range , but populations are vulnerable to local extinction ( extirpation ) by coyotes and domestic animals . With a gray to brown coat , whiskered face , and black-tufted ears , the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized genus Lynx . It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx , with which it shares parts of its range , but is about twice as large as the domestic cat . It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped , stubby ( or bobbed ) tail , from which it derives its name . Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares , it hunts insects , chickens , geese and other birds , small rodents , and deer . Prey selection depends on location and habitat , season , and abundance . Like most cats , the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary , although with some overlap in home ranges . It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries , including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces . The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months .",
  "/wiki/Gray_wolf": "The wolf ( Canis lupus ) , also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf , is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America . It is the largest extant member of Canidae , with males averaging 40 kg ( 88 lb ) and females 37 kg ( 82 lb ) . On average , wolves measure 105-160 cm ( 41-63 in ) in length and 80-85 cm ( 31-33 in ) at shoulder height . The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed features , particularly the ears and muzzle . The wolf is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species , such as the coyote and the golden jackal , to produce fertile hybrids with them . The winter fur of a wolf is long and bushy and predominantly mottled gray , although nearly pure white , red and brown to black colours also occur . Up to 38 subspecies of wolf have been recognized including the domestic dog . The wolf is the most specialized member of the genus Canis for cooperative big game hunting , as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey , its more social nature , and its highly advanced expressive behaviour . It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring . Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition within the pack for food . Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality . The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds primarily on large wild hooved mammals , though it also eats smaller animals , livestock , carrion , and garbage .",
  "/wiki/Red_wolf": "The red wolf ( Canis lupus rufus or Canis rufus ) is a canine native to the southeastern United States which has a reddish-tawny color to its fur . Morphologically it is intermediate between the coyote and gray wolf , and is very closely related to the eastern wolf of eastern Canada . The red wolf 's proper taxonomic classification - in essence , whether it is an admixture of wolf and coyote or a third , distinct species - has been contentious for well over a century and is still under debate . Because of this , it is sometimes excluded from endangered species lists despite its critically low numbers . Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 , the U.S . Fisheries and Wildlife service currently recognizes the red wolf as an endangered and grants protected status . Canis rufus is not listed in the CITES Appendices of endangered species . Since 1996 the IUCN has listed it as a critically endangered species .",
  "/wiki/American_black_bear": "The American black bear ( Ursus americanus , previously known as Euarctos americanus ) is a medium-sized bear native to North America . It is the continent 's smallest and most widely distributed bear species . American black bears are omnivores , with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location . They typically live in largely forested areas , but do leave forests in search of food . Sometimes they become attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food . The American black bear is the world 's most common bear species . It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) as a least-concern species , due to its widespread distribution and a large population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined . Along with the brown bear , it is one of only two of the eight modern bear species not considered by the IUCN to be globally threatened with extinction . American black bears often mark trees using their teeth and claws as a form of communication with other bears , a behavior common to many species of bears .",
  "/wiki/Fisher_(animal)": "The fisher ( Pekania pennanti ) is a small , carnivorous mammal native to North America . It is a member of the mustelid family ( commonly referred to as the weasel family ) , and is in the monospecific genus Pekania . The fisher is closely related to , but larger than , the American marten ( Martes americana ) . The fisher is a forest-dwelling creature whose range covers much of the boreal forest in Canada to the northern United States . Names derived from aboriginal languages include pekan , pequam , wejack , and woolang . It is sometimes misleadingly referred to as a fisher cat , although it is not a cat . Males and females look similar . Adult males are 90 to 120 cm ( 35-47 in ) long and weigh 3.5 to 6.0 kilograms ( 8-13 lb ) . Adult females are 75 to 95 cm ( 30-37 in ) long and weigh 2.0 to 2.5 kg ( 4-6 lb ) . The fur of the fisher varies seasonally , being denser and glossier in the winter . During the summer , the color becomes more mottled , as the fur goes through a moulting cycle . The fisher prefers to hunt in full forest .",
  "/wiki/North_American_river_otter": "The North American river otter ( Lontra canadensis ) , also known as the northern river otter or the common otter , is a semiaquatic mammal endemic to the North American continent found in and along its waterways and coasts . An adult North American river otter can weigh between 5.0 and 14 kg ( 11.0 and 30.9 lb ) . The river otter is protected and insulated by a thick , water-repellent coat of fur . The North American river otter , a member of the subfamily Lutrinae in the weasel family ( Mustelidae ) , is equally versatile in the water and on land . It establishes a burrow close to the water 's edge in river , lake , swamp , coastal shoreline , tidal flat , or estuary ecosystems . The den typically has many tunnel openings , one of which generally allows the otter to enter and exit the body of water . Female North American river otters give birth in these burrows , producing litters of one to six young . North American river otters , like most predators , prey upon the most readily accessible species . Fish is a favored food among the otters , but they also consume various amphibians ( such as salamanders and frogs ) , freshwater clams , mussels , snails , small turtles and crayfish . The most common fish consumed are perch , suckers , and catfish . Instances of North American river otters eating small mammals , such as mice and squirrels , and occasionally birds have been reported as well . There have also been some reports of river otters attacking and even drowning dogs .",
  "/wiki/Porcupine": "Porcupines are large rodents with coats of sharp spines , or quills , that protect them against predators . The term covers two families of animals : the Old World porcupines of family Hystricidae , and the New World porcupines of family Erethizontidae . Both families belong to the infraorder Hystricognathi within the profoundly diverse order Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of quills : despite this , the two groups are distinct from each other and are not closely related to each other within the Hystricognathi . The Old World porcupines live in southern Europe , Asia ( western and southern ) , and most of Africa . They are large , terrestrial , and strictly nocturnal . In taxonomic terms , they form the family Hystricidae . The New World porcupines are indigenous to North America and northern South America . They live in wooded areas and can climb trees , where some species spend their entire lives . They are less strictly nocturnal than their Old World relatives , and generally smaller . In taxonomic terms , they form the family Erethizontidae . Most porcupines are about 60-90 cm ( 25-36 in ) long , with a 20-25 cm ( 8-10 in ) long tail . [ dubious - discuss ] Weighing 5-16 kg ( 12-35 lb ) , they are rounded , large , and slow , and use aposematic strategy of defence .",
  "/wiki/Passenger_pigeon": "The passenger pigeon or wild pigeon ( Ectopistes migratorius ) is an extinct species of pigeon that was endemic to North America . Its common name is derived from the French word passager , meaning passing by , due to the migratory habits of the species . The scientific name also refers to its migratory characteristics . The morphologically similar mourning dove ( Zenaida macroura ) was long thought to be its closest relative , and the two were at times confused , but genetic analysis has shown that the genus Patagioenas is more closely related to it than the Zenaida doves . The passenger pigeon was sexually dimorphic in size and coloration . The male was 390 to 410 mm ( 15.4 to 16.1 in ) in length , mainly gray on the upperparts , lighter on the underparts , with iridescent bronze feathers on the neck , and black spots on the wings . The female was 380 to 400 mm ( 15.0 to 15.7 in ) , and was duller and browner than the male overall . The juvenile was similar to the female , but without iridescence . It mainly inhabited the deciduous forests of eastern North America and was also recorded elsewhere , but bred primarily around the Great Lakes . The pigeon migrated in enormous flocks , constantly searching for food , shelter , and breeding grounds , and was once the most abundant bird in North America , numbering around 3 billion , and possibly up to 5 billion . A very fast flyer , the passenger pigeon could reach a speed of 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) . The bird fed mainly on mast , and also fruits and invertebrates .",
  "/wiki/Piping_plover": "The piping plover ( Charadrius melodus ) is a small sand-colored , sparrow-sized shorebird that nests and feeds along coastal sand and gravel beaches in North America . The adult has yellow-orange-red legs , a black band across the forehead from eye to eye , and a black stripe running along the breast line . This chest band is usually thicker in males during the breeding season , and it is the only reliable way to tell the sexes apart . The bird is difficult to see when it is standing still , as it blends well with open , sandy beach habitats . It typically runs in short spurts and stops . There are two subspecies of piping plovers : the eastern population is known as Charadrius melodus melodus and the mid-west population is known as C. m. circumcinctus . The bird 's name is derived from its plaintive bell-like whistles which are often heard before the bird is visible . Total population is currently estimated at about 6,510 individuals . A preliminary estimate showed 3,350 birds in 2003 on the Atlantic Coast alone , 52% of the total . The population has been increasing since 1999 . Their breeding habitat includes beaches and sand flats on the Atlantic coast , the shores of the Great Lakes , and in the mid-west of Canada and the United States . They nest on sandy or gravel beaches or shoals ."
