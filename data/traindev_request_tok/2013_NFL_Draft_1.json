  "/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)": "Safety , historically known as a safetyman , is a position in gridiron football played by a member of the defense . The safeties are defensive backs who line up from ten to fifteen yards from the line of scrimmage . There are two variations of the position in a typical American formation : the free safety ( FS ) and the strong safety ( SS ) . Their duties depend on the defensive scheme . The defensive responsibilities of the safety and cornerback usually involve pass coverage towards the middle and sidelines of the field , respectively . While American ( 11-player ) formations generally use two safeties , Canadian ( 12-player ) formations generally have one safety and two defensive halfbacks , a position not used in the American game . As professional and college football have become more focused on the passing game , safeties have become more involved in covering the eligible pass receivers . Safeties are the last line of defense ; they are expected to be reliable tacklers , and many safeties rank among the hardest hitters in football . Safety positions can also be converted cornerbacks , either by design ( Byron Jones ) or as a cornerback ages ( Charles Woodson , DeAngelo Hall , Lardarius Webb , Tramon Williams ) . Historically , in the era of the one-platoon system , the safety was known as the defensive fullback ( specifically the free safety ; the strong safety would be a defensive halfback , a term still in Canadian parlance ) or goaltender .",

  "/wiki/Linebacker": "A linebacker ( LB or backer ) is a playing position in gridiron football . Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap . When a blitz is called by the defense , it is mainly to sack or hurry the opposing offense 's quarterback . Linebackers are often regarded as the most important position in defense , due to their versatility in providing hard hits on running plays or an additional layer of pass defense , when required . Similar to the free safety position , linebackers are required to use their judgment on every snap , to determine their role during that particular play .",

The location in the present day is the hill of Hisarlik and its immediate vicinity . In modern scholarly nomenclature , the Ridge of Troy ( including Hisarlik ) borders the Plain of Troy , flat agricultural land , which conducts the lower Scamander River to the strait . Troy was the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle , in particular in the Iliad , one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer . Metrical evidence from the Iliad and the Odyssey suggests that the name \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ( Ilion ) formerly began with a digamma : \u03dc\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ( Wilion ) ; [ note 2 ] this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city , Wilusa . After a destruction at the end of the Bronze Age , believed to represent the end of the Trojan War , and a period of abandonment or near-abandonment during the subsequent Dark Age , the site acquired a new population of Greek-speakers , who built a classical city that became along with the rest of Anatolia a part of the Persian Empire . The Troad was liberated by Alexander the Great , an admirer of Achilles , who he believed had the same type of glorious ( but short-lived ) destiny . After the Roman conquest of this now Hellenistic Greek-speaking world , a new capital called Ilium ( from Greek : \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , Ilion ) was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus . It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople , became a bishopric , was abandoned , repopulated for a few centuries in the Byzantine era , was abandoned again , and is now a Latin Catholic titular see . Most recently it has risen to prominence as an archaeological site . In the mid-19th century the Calvert family , wealthy Levantine English settlers of the Troad , occupying a working farm a few miles from Hisarlik , purchased much of the hill in the belief that it contained the ruins of Troy .

In basketball , Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won seven NCAA Championships ( UConn with three , Villanova , Georgetown , Syracuse , and Louisville with one each ) . Of the Big East 's full members , all but South Florida attended the Final Four , the most of any conference , though Marquette , DePaul , Notre Dame , Rutgers , Cincinnati , and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East . In 2011 , the Big East set the record for the most teams sent to the NCAA Division I Men 's Basketball Championship by a single conference with eleven out of their sixteen teams qualifying . In football , the Big East entered competition as a conference in 1991 , after inviting five football colleges to become members of the Big East , joining three teams from the Big East whose football teams were competing as Division I independents ( Boston College , Pittsburgh and Syracuse ) to form a new Division I football league . The strength of this league earned the Big East an automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series , when that series was created in 1998 . The Big East won two national football championships , both by University of Miami . Between 2005 and 2012 , four of the more successful football schools left the Big East for other conferences , starting a process that led to a complete realignment of the Big East in 2013 .

However , many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks , due to their position as the primary ball carrier ; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks .

  "/wiki/Long_snapper": "In gridiron football , the long snapper ( or deep snapper ) is a special teams specialist whose duty is to snap the football over a longer distance , typically around 15 yards during punts , and 7-8 yards during field goals and extra point attempts . During field goal and point after touchdown attempts , the snap is received by the holder , typically 7-8 yards away . During punts , the snap is delivered to the punter from 13-15 yards away . Following a punt snap , the snapper often executes a blocking assignment and then must cover the kick by running downfield and attempting to stop the opposing team 's punt returner from advancing the ball in the opposite direction . If the punt goes uncaught , it is the snapper 's responsibility to make sure the ball does not enter the end zone or bounce backward resulting in loss of yards . The majority of snappers at the highest levels of competition are specialized , meaning that they uniquely play the position of snapper , or have limited responsibilities elsewhere . A good punt snap should hit the target -- the punter 's hands at the abdomen or waistline -- between .65 and .75 seconds and with a tight spiral for easy handling . A bad snap is an off-target snap which causes the delay or failure of a kick or forces the punter into some other potentially compromising situation .",
