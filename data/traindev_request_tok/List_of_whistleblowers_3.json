A leading U.S. counter-terrorism , counterintelligence , and criminal investigative organization , the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes . Although many of the FBI 's functions are unique , its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5 and the Russian FSB . Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad , the FBI is primarily a domestic agency , maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States , and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation . At an FBI field office , a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence . Despite its domestic focus , the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint , operating 60 Legal Attache ( LEGAT ) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe . These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries . The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas , just as the CIA has a limited domestic function ; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies . The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation , the BOI or BI for short . Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in 1935 . The FBI headquarters is the J.

  "/wiki/Whistleblower": "A whistleblower ( also written as whistle-blower or whistle blower ) is a person who exposes secretive information or activity that is deemed illegal , unethical , or not correct within a private or public organization . The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways : violation of company policy/rules , law , regulation , or threat to public interest/national security , as well as fraud , and corruption . Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to surface either internally or externally . Internally , a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor . Externally , a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media , government , law enforcement , or those who are concerned . Whistleblowers , however , take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing . Because of this , a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers . Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers , but that protection can only go so far . Whistleblowers face legal action , criminal charges , social stigma , and termination from any position , office , or job . Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public . The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on : private sector , or public sector . Depending on many factors , both can have varying results .",

Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission , nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions . Presently , the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium . Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators . Generating electricity from fusion power remains at the focus of international research . This article mostly deals with nuclear fission power for electricity generation . Civilian nuclear power supplied 2,563 terawatt hours ( TWh ) of electricity in 2018 , equivalent to about 10% of global electricity generation , and was the second largest low-carbon power source after hydroelectricity . As of December 2019 , there are 443 civilian fission reactors in the world , with a combined electrical capacity of 395 gigawatt ( GW ) . There are also 56 nuclear power reactors under construction and 109 reactors planned , with a combined capacity of 60 GW and 120 GW , respectively . Most reactors under construction are generation III reactors in Asia . Nuclear power has one of the lowest levels of fatalities per unit of energy generated compared to other energy sources .

  "/wiki/Radioactive": "Radioactive decay ( also known as nuclear decay , radioactivity , radioactive disintegration or nuclear disintegration ) is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation . A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive . Three of the most common types of decay are alpha decay , beta decay , and gamma decay , all of which involve emitting one or more particles or photons . Radioactive decay is a stochastic ( i.e . random ) process at the level of single atoms . According to quantum theory , it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay , regardless of how long the atom has existed . However , for a significant number of identical atoms , the overall decay rate can be expressed as a decay constant or as half-life . The half-lives of radioactive atoms have a huge range ; from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe . The decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide ( or parent radioisotope [ note 1 ] ) , and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide . Except for gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited state , the decay is a nuclear transmutation resulting in a daughter containing a different number of protons or neutrons ( or both ) . When the number of protons changes , an atom of a different chemical element is created .",

Illicit and even illegal activities within the administration of the program were revealed , involving misuse and misdirection of public funds intended for government advertising in Quebec . Such misdirections included sponsorship money awarded to Liberal Party-linked ad firms in return for little or no work , in which firms maintained Liberal organizers or fundraisers on their payrolls or donated back part of the money to the Liberal Party . The resulting investigations and scandal affected the Liberal Party of Canada and the then-government of Prime Minister Paul Martin . It was an ongoing affair for years , but rose to national prominence in early 2004 after the program was examined by Sheila Fraser , the federal auditor general . Here are some of the major findings reported by Auditor General Sheila Fraser :",
  "/wiki/David_Franklin_(pharmacy)": "David Franklin is an American microbiologist and former fellow of Harvard Medical School who while employed by Parke-Davis filed the 1996 whistleblower lawsuit exposing their illegal promotion of Neurontin ( gabapentin ) for off-label uses . Franklin 's suit , filed on behalf of the citizens of the United States under the qui tam provisions of US federal and state law , uncovered illegal pharmaceutical industry practices and created new legal precedent that resulted in a cascade of criminal convictions and civil and criminal penalties against Pfizer and several other pharmaceutical companies totalling more than $ 7 billion . Civil cases also followed Franklin v. Parke-Davis . Insurance companies , led by Kaiser Permanente , sued Pfizer for fraud and violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ; the Kaiser case settled in April 2014 after Pfizer 's appeal at the US Supreme Court was rejected . Franklin v. Pfizer also spawned more than a thousand wrongful death ( suicide ) suits associated with use of Neurontin . Numerous books have addressed the social , economic and healthcare implications of Dr. Franklin 's stance and actions . The settlement was the first off-label promotion settlement under the False Claims Act . :194",

Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , which is a domestic security service , the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering , with only limited domestic intelligence collection . Though it is not the only agency of the federal government of the United States specializing in HUMINT , the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the U.S. intelligence community . Moreover , the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President . It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions , such as the Special Activities Center . The CIA was also instrumental in establishing intelligence services in several U.S. allied countries , such as Germany 's BND . Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 , the CIA Director concurrently served as the head of the Intelligence Community ; today , the CIA is organized under the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) . Despite transferring some of its powers to the DNI , the CIA has grown in size as a result of the September 11 attacks . In 2013 , The Washington Post reported that in the fiscal year 2010 , the CIA had the largest budget of all IC agencies , exceeding previous estimates .

Between 1941 and 1945 , across German-occupied Europe , Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered some six million Jews , around two-thirds of Europe 's Jewish population . [ a ] [ c ] The murders were carried out in pogroms and mass shootings ; by a policy of extermination through work in concentration camps ; and in gas chambers and gas vans in German extermination camps , chiefly Auschwitz , Be\u0142\u017cec , Che\u0142mno , Majdanek , Sobib\u00f3r , and Treblinka in occupied Poland . Germany implemented the persecution in stages . Following Adolf Hitler 's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 , the regime built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and those deemed undesirable , starting with Dachau on 22 March 1933 . After the passing of the Enabling Act on 24 March , which gave Hitler plenary powers , the government began isolating Jews from civil society ; this included boycotting Jewish businesses in April 1933 and enacting the Nuremberg Laws in September 1935 . On 9-10 November 1938 , eight months after Germany annexed Austria , Jewish businesses and other buildings were ransacked , smashed or set on fire throughout Germany and Austria during what became known as Kristallnacht ( the Night of Broken Glass ) . After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 , triggering World War II , the regime set up ghettos to segregate Jews from the rest of the population . Eventually thousands of camps and other detention sites were established across German-occupied Europe . The segregation of Jews in ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the Final Solution to the Jewish Question , discussed by senior Nazi officials at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin in January 1942 . As German forces captured territories in the East , all anti-Jewish measures were radicalized . Under the coordination of the SS , with directions from the highest leadership of the Nazi Party , killings were committed within Germany itself , throughout occupied Europe , and within territories controlled by Germany 's allies .",
  "/wiki/Political_asylum": "The right of asylum ( sometimes called right of political asylum , from the Ancient Greek word \u1f04\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd ) is an ancient juridical concept , under which a person persecuted by one 's own country may be protected by another sovereign authority , such as another country or church official , who in medieval times could offer sanctuary . This right was recognized by the Egyptians , the Greeks , and the Hebrews , from whom it was adopted into Western tradition . Ren\u00e9 Descartes fled to the Netherlands , Voltaire to England , and Thomas Hobbes to France , because each state offered protection to persecuted foreigners . The Egyptians , Greeks , and Hebrews recognized a religious right of asylum , protecting criminals ( or those accused of crime ) from legal action to some extent . This principle was later adopted by the established Christian church , and various rules were developed that detailed how to qualify for protection and what degree of protection one would receive . The Council of Orleans decided in 511 , in the presence of Clovis I , that asylum could be granted to anyone who took refuge in a church or on church property , or at the home of a bishop . This protection was extended to murderers , thieves and adulterers alike . That Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution is enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and supported by the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees .

In 1993 , Parkinson became the key person on the Maralinga clean-up project , representing the then federal Labor government ( through the Department of Primary Industry and Energy ) . By 1997 , however , there was much cost-cutting involved in the project , and differences of opinion about how the project should proceed , which led to the sacking of Parkinson by the new Howard government . The clean-up , which involved simply burying untreated long-lived radioactive debris in holes in the ground , was totally unsatisfactory according to Parkinson . He exposed the situation through the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , provoking a strong rebuttal from the government , composed of scientific distortion and personal abuse . The plan was to collect some of the contaminated soil and bury that soil in a specially prepared trench 15 metres deep . Several thousand tonnes of debris contaminated with plutonium was to be treated by a process of in situ vitrification . After collection and burial of the soil , the project moved to the second phase - the treatment of 21 pits by vitrification . Against the advice of Parkinson , the government department extended the contract of the project manager , even though that company had no knowledge of the complex process of vitrification . At that stage Parkinson was removed from the project . The government and the project manager then embarked on a hybrid scheme in which some pits would be exhumed and others treated by vitrification .",

This was the first drop of a British nuclear weapon from an aircraft . Operation Buffalo was followed by Operation Antler in 1957 , which tested new , light-weight nuclear weapons . Three tests were conducted in this series : Tadje ( 0.93 kilotonnes of TNT ( 3.9 TJ ) , Biak 5.67 kilotonnes of TNT ( 23.7 TJ ) and Taranak 26.6 kilotonnes of TNT ( 111 TJ ) . The first two were conducted from towers , while the last was suspended from balloons . Tadje used cobalt pellets as a tracer for determining yield , resulting in rumours that Britain was developing a cobalt bomb . Between 1956 and 1963 , the Maralinga site was also used for minor trials , tests of nuclear weapons components not involving nuclear explosions . Kittens were trials of neutron initiators ; Rats and Tims measured how the fissile core of a nuclear weapon was compressed by the high explosive shock wave ; and Vixens investigated the effects of fire or non-nuclear explosions on atomic weapons . Ultimately , the minor trials generated more contamination than the major tests .",

  "/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party": "The Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) , also simply known as Labor and historically spelt Labour , is a major centre-left political party in Australia . The party has been in opposition at the federal level since the 2013 federal election . The party is a federal party with branches in each state and territory . Labor is in government in the states of Victoria , Queensland , Western Australia , and in both the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory . The party competes against the Liberal/National Coalition for political office at the federal , state and sometimes local levels . It is the oldest political party in Australia . Labor 's constitution has long stated : The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry , production , distribution and exchange , to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields . This socialist objective was introduced in 1921 , but was later qualified by two further objectives : maintenance of and support for a competitive non-monopolistic private sector and the right to own private property . Labor governments have not attempted the democratic socialisation of any industry since the 1940s , when the Chifley Government failed to nationalise the private banks , and in fact have privatised several industries such as aviation and banking . Labor 's current National Platform describes the party as a modern social democratic party . The ALP was not founded as a federal party until after the first sitting of the Australian Parliament in 1901 . Nevertheless , it is regarded as descended from labour parties founded in the various Australian colonies by the emerging labour movement in Australia , formally beginning in 1891 .",
  "/wiki/Howard_government": "The Howard Government refers to the federal executive government of Australia led by Prime Minister John Howard between 11 March 1996 and 3 December 2007 . It was made up of members of the Liberal-National Coalition , which won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives at four successive elections . The Howard Government commenced following victory over the Keating Government at the 1996 federal election . It concluded with its defeat at the 2007 federal election by the Australian Labor Party , whose leader Kevin Rudd then formed the First Rudd Government . It was the second-longest government under a single Prime Minister , with the longest having been the second Menzies Government ( 1949-1966 ) . Two senior ministers served in single roles for the duration of the Government ; Peter Costello as Treasurer and Alexander Downer as Minister for Foreign Affairs . The leader of the National Party served as Deputy Prime Minister . Three men served in this capacity during the Howard government : Tim Fischer until July 1999 , followed by John Anderson until July 2005 and then Mark Vaile . Decisions of the Executive were made either by the Cabinet or by the appropriate Minister . For the first three terms of government , and part of the fourth term , the Howard Government did not have control of the Senate . Legislation needed the support of the Opposition or minor parties for that legislation to be passed and become law . In the 2004 election , the Coalition won control of the Senate for all but the first nine months of its fourth term , and was able to pass legislation without the support of minor parties .",

  "/wiki/Civil_service": "The civil service is a collective term for a sector of government composed mainly of career bureaucrats hired on professional merit rather than appointed or elected , whose institutional tenure typically survives transitions of political leadership . A civil servant or public servant is a person so employed in the public sector employed for a government department or agency . Civil ( or public ) servants work for government departments , and answer to the government , not a political party . The extent of civil servants of a state as part of the civil service varies from country to country . In the United Kingdom , for instance , only Crown ( national government ) employees are referred to as civil servants whereas country or city employees are not . Many consider the study of service to be a part of the field of public administration . Workers in non-departmental public bodies ( sometimes called QUANGOs ) may also be classed as civil servants for the purpose of statistics and possibly for their terms and conditions . Collectively a state 's civil servants form its civil service or public service . An international civil servant or international staff member is a civilian employee who is employed by an intergovernmental organization . These international civil servants do not resort under any national legislation ( from which they have immunity of jurisdiction ) but are governed by internal staff regulations . All disputes related to international civil service are brought before special tribunals created by these international organizations such as , for instance , the Administrative Tribunal of the ILO . Specific referral can be made to the International Civil Service Commission ( ICSC ) of the United Nations , an independent expert body established by the United Nations General Assembly .",

The Commissioners are proposed by the Council of the European Union , on the basis of suggestions made by the national governments , and then appointed by the European Council after the approval of the European Parliament . It is common , although not a formal requirement , that the commissioners have previously held senior political positions , such as being a member of the European Parliament or a government minister . This EU institution operates as a cabinet government , with 27 members of the Commission ( informally known as commissioners ) . There is one member per member state , but members are bound by their oath of office to represent the general interest of the EU as a whole rather than their home state . One of the 27 is the Commission President ( currently Ursula von der Leyen ) proposed by the European Council and elected by the European Parliament . The Council of the European Union then nominates the other members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated President , and the 27 members as a single body are then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament .

  "/wiki/Government_corruption": "Political corruption is the use of powers by government officials or their network contacts for illegitimate private gain . Forms of corruption vary , but include bribery , extortion , cronyism , nepotism , parochialism , patronage , influence peddling , graft , and embezzlement . Corruption may facilitate criminal enterprise such as drug trafficking , money laundering , and Human trafficking , though it is not restricted to these activities . Misuse of government power for other purposes , such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality , is also considered political corruption . Over time , corruption has been defined differently . For example , in a simple context , while performing work for a government or as a representative , it is unethical to accept a gift . Any free gift could be construed as a scheme to lure the recipient towards some biases . In most cases , the gift is seen as an intention to seek certain favors such as work promotion , tipping in order to win a contract , job or exemption from certain tasks in the case of junior worker handing in the gift to a senior employee who can be key in winning the favor . Some forms of corruption - now called institutional corruption - are distinguished from bribery and other kinds of obvious personal gain . A similar problem of corruption arises in any institution that depends on financial support from people who have interests that may conflict with the primary purpose of the institution . An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties , is done under color of law or involves trading in influence . The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction .",

Specifically , Clinton was asked under oath about Monica Lewinsky in the Jones suit , denied having ever had sexual relations with her , and was accused of perjury after evidence of sexual contact was exposed . The Jones lawsuit also led to a landmark legal precedent by the U.S. Supreme Court which ruled that a sitting U.S. president is not exempt from civil litigation for acts committed outside of public office . Jones 's suit was dismissed as lacking legal merit prior to Clinton 's impeachment and the exposure of the Lewinsky affair . But in August 1998 Clinton 's relationship with Lewinsky , and compelling evidence that he had lied about it under oath in the Jones suit , was brought to light . At that point Jones appealed the ruling , and her appeal gained traction following Clinton 's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998 . On appeal , Clinton agreed to an out-of-court settlement , paying Jones and her lawyers $ 850,000 to drop the suit . Clinton 's lawyer said that the President made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life .
